215	138	We drove a few minutes, parked near the station, and caught a train that got us to the heart of the city in 30 minutes. Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago vicinity , with a bajiggety restaurants, parallel bars , shops, etc.	0

278	180	Shantell Preusser's place was clean & comfortable; it was within walking/ train distance of everything that we needed.

Parking and checkin were really easy, and Shantell Preusser was easy to communicate with.	0
308	199	We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing. Check in is simple and easy to complete. Arriving the topographic point was lovely and warm, music on, snacks left out, bottled water, tea, coffee and basic supplies on hand which really made it feel like home.	0

362	230	Same was true for the day of my check-out - Richard Batton kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. My bed was extremely comfortable, in-room shower/vanity/toilet was great, plenty of outlets to charge your technology, I was lacking nothing. There was water with a few lemon slices waiting for me on the night stand - again no details were missed.	0
367	233	This place is PHENOMENAL!!! Words can't describe how lovely having a glass of wine on the patio in bloom is while surrounded by the incredible sights and sounds of the city!

387	245	The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference.	0
397	251	The kitchen is well appointed - the lone thing not available was a microwave, but Edwin Green commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon. I recommend staying here unconditionally!	0
399	252	Thomas George’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Robert Huckabaa and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick response , ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay.	0

430	271	Very stylish, tidy, and roomy. There was no need to drive at all! Min was very responsive and very quick to answer my questions.	0
440	276	As a guest you have your own entrance, control of the thermostat, and a short ton of storage. The space is used very well in this home and doesn’t leave you feeling cramped. Richard Batton’s home is located a few blocks from restaurants, bars, and some light shopping (Target, Trader Joe’s, TJ Maxx, Urban Outfitters).	0
446	280	This was my second time staying at Min's unit, and I would have booked the entire weekend rather than just one night if there had been availability. I knew exactly what to expect since I had stayed in January, but Min did tell me about the recent changes (a new couch and bed). He even met me at my car and helped me with my luggage as well as my parking situation.	0
448	281	He even met me at my car and helped me with my luggage as well as my parking situation. I love this place and definitely would stay again – it's very conveniently located to El (train) and bus lines but is quiet and peaceful.	0
451	284	My boyfriend went to the gym downstairs, while I enjoyed the coziness of lounging around in the living room. The rooftop deck is worth checking out too. We went at night and the view was beautiful, especially with all the snow.	0
452	285	My boyfriend went to the gym downstairs, while I enjoyed the coziness of lounging around in the living room. My boyfriend and I had minimal interaction with the host, Aaron, but he’s easily accessible. Really nice guy and genuine when we spoke on our last day!	0
464	293	The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Aaron’s place and convenient! Although, we had not met Aaron, he was always available when needed and was pretty clear with the instructions. Also, the apartment is near many places that you explore.	0
465	293	The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Sheri Vowell place and convenient! Although, we had not met Shelton Gill, he was always available when needed and was pretty clear with the instructions. Also, the apartment is near many places that you explore.	0
472	297	I had an early flight and only spent one night there (barely) and I wish I would have had more time there to enjoy the home and neighborhood. If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll definitely look into staying at Dennis Steward and Traci’s place and give myself more time to soak it in. Cozy Room 3 has everything - nice bathroom with shower, a Keurig coffee maker, a mini fridge, big fluffy soft towels, plenty of storage space, and a lock on the door.	0

495	310	In the evenings I enjoyed being able to walk around the lovely neighborhood and to College Ave where there were lots of nice shops and restaurants. A healthy and filling breakfast was much appreciated. The room was small but had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable for a few nights.	0
498	312	I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a wonderful respite from urban Berkeley. If you stay here, it'll likely take you a bit to adjust to the shower and water closet, if you're not used to that type of thing, but I thought it was really fun taking a shower in a greenhouse. It's worth mentioning that there's not a microwave or stove, so if you plan on cooking/warming leftovers, you may want to take that into account.	0

529	333	It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. Very, very comfy couch and bed. The wine and bite were a lovely touch.	0
535	337	The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. Also, it does get a little bit warmer when you're sleeping that high up so I had to turn up the AC during the night. All-in-all, we really enjoyed our stay.	0
537	338	The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. We didn't get to meet Christopher Brown in person but we met his son who graciously helped us with late-night check-in. Both were very kind and professional, we felt like we were in good hands :) hope to be back in the future!	0
541	341	The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head.

553	350	The bed is extremely cozy and comfortable. We were headed to San Diego for the next part of our trip and needed a quick laundry fix. Marianne is by far the best Airbnb host.	0
568	359	She is so lovely and friendly everyday. You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. There is all you need in kitchen, bathroom, living room bedroom.	0
574	362	You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cunning . Thank you ! !	0
585	368	are afterthoughts in many Airbnb’s. The apartment was very private and quiet. Most of all, we loved meeting Joan Litwin.	0
594	374	The comforts are of a great quality and we had everything we needed. Raquel Eastham and Ralph are lovely people and made us all feel welcome. I would not hesitate to recommend this listing.	0
602	380	Best of all was the attention to detail. The lone regret that we have is not being able to stay more days at her lovely home. Hopefully we can do that again in the future.	0
604	381	Best of all was the attention to detail. We absolutely loved our stay at Sierra's small cozy apartment. It was decorated nicely and had everything we needed included a Lara bar that was needed for my post surgery wooziness.	0
607	383	We absolutely loved our stay at Sierra's little cozy apartment. Anytime I asked a question she got back to me right away! The place was immaculate which is very important to me, it is what I look for the most in Airbnb reviews and this place did not disappoint.	0
616	389	We arrived a bit earlier than expected and my phone failed to send the ETA message to Sierra but she let us drop our things off and freshen up which was deeply appreciated. It was quiet and had plenty of street parking. The apartment itself was cutely decorated and very homey.	0
636	402	We had the most wonderful stay at Ron & Laurie’s guesthouse. They have really thought of everything their guests might need. They had complied an incredibly extensive guest book for local tips and offered lots of delicious restaurant suggestions.	0
640	405	But they kindly provide earplugs so if you bring an eye mask you’ll be all set! Thank you!	0
641	406	Ron and Laurie are excellent hosts, and their historic home is at the heart of everything! The charming back studio apartment opens to a lovely private  garden from a separate side entrance. I enjoyed sunbathing and decompressing there.	0
644	408	From the apt I walked all the way home from UCal Berkeley and the Botanical Garden, which is probably only for people who love to walk as I do. I also walked easily over to Cesar Chavez Park and the Marina. Otherwise, you can take Uber or Lyft or public transport via 511.org to get where you want to be, or walk a block and a half to the cute shops and restaurants along 4th Avenue.	0
648	410	Ron & Laurie are amazing hosts! They let me drop off my bags early before check-in so I could get to wear I was going on time, and offered to hold onto them after I left so I didn't have to carry them around all day before my evening flight. They provided me everything I could have asked for, including the most amazing coffee (and cream and sugar) and tea and cookies.	0
653	414	Lots of pillows in varying levels of firmness...just the best sleep experience possible. Plenty of space to stretch out and put your stuff. The bathroom is lovely, with a huge deep soaking tub for baths, a shower with some serious water pressure, and lovely succulents in the window.	0

658	417	This is a lovely apartment and Ron and Lauren Jensen are very accommodating hosts. The apartment is within a short walk of a number of restaurants and shops and Joan Litwin suggestions for restaurants were great.

1023	646	Their street is very comfortable/safe, but a few streets from the BART West Oakland to their home may seem unsafe or less well kept.

3635	2235	It is within easy reach of public transportation into the heart of the city, but it is far enough away from the city to offer a quiet respite from the hubbub of San Francisco.

The location was ideal for us, we didn’t want to stay downtown we wanted chilled and slower which is exactly what we got.	0
3637	2236	Heathers apartment was exactly as I expected it to be, it is exactly as pictured, clean and aired.

3678	2261	! Heather's home is in a supreme location if you're looking for a section of San Francisco that is wonderfully calm and more tender than the others while still providing lots to do and see (doesn't hurt to also be in an area where parking is easy to find!). Her shared home is beautifully decorated and we enjoyed looking through the big binder of things to check out— even me as someone who's spent seven years in the past living in this gem of a city.	0
3684	2265	Chris goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The book with all the advice and transportation tips were so helpful, it made eating and getting around much easy !!

3691	2269	Clifford Winkler’s apartment was exactly as it appears in the pictures, It is beautiful and the perfect place to come home to after a big day exploring in the city. It is so close to many amazing restaurants and cafes. Make sure you use the resource folder provided and eat at the restaurants suggested.	0
3702	2275	Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! We spent 3 nights at Chris’s studio apartment and think that the only valid description for both the hosts and the apartment is ‘fantastic’! Chris went out of her way to make our stay particular .	0
3703	2276	We spent 3 nights at Chris’s studio apartment and think that the only valid description for both the hosts and the apartment is ‘fantastic’! The studio was spotless and provided all that we could wish for in terms of comfort and facilities, including a chance to relax in the garden and some very welcoming breakfast and other amenities. For us a special bonus was the superb location - less than 5-minute walk to the wonderful Golden Gate Park – a must visit - along with excellent transport links to other areas of the city.	0
3711	2280	I arrived rather late in the evening (around 9:30ish), and Chris came out to greet me and show me the place. Once inside the apartment, there are a set of doors that lead out to the garden which is also enclosed. The apartment was very spacious and tidy.	0
3715	2282	It was a nice surprise to see that the fridge was stocked with water, OJ, milk, and yogurt. The same can be said for the bathroom/shower which included shampoo, soap, and body wash. There was also a drawer full of travel-sized hygienic products if you happened to forget anything.	0
3720	2286	Perfect place to stay in SF. Beautiful room, sparkling clean and large shower with immediate hot water, comfortable bed with high-quality linens, public transportation easily available, close to several coffee shops and yummy bakeries, easy walk to Golden Gate Park, close to Safeway, and immediate response from Chris to any request.

3776	2317	The bed is very comfy and we really appreciated the charging stations on either side. If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a spot tricky on the streets, especially late at night. During the day we didn't have much trouble finding a place to park.	0
3780	2319	If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a bit tricky on the streets, especially late at night. We had an excellent stay at Tyler’s place. By the time we arrived in San Francisco, we were a spot tired from our road-trip from Vancouver, and so it was a real treat to have such a clean topographic point with complimentary snacks, beer, and HBO/Netflix for our first night.	0
3789	2324	Not only was it lovely to be in a home in a neighborhood, but the room was like a lux hotel suite! Rayford Kelly has gone above and beyond thinking of ways to make our stay comfortable; a comfy bed, a sparkling room, lovely bath amenities, and snacks. It was great and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco who is ambulatory.	0
3790	2325	It was great and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco who is ambulatory. I say ambulatory because Tyler's place is on a steep street and you will need to climb stairs to his entry- so you have to be able to walk/climb. Also, because this place is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood.	0
3791	2326	Also, because this place is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood. I found parking in that neighborhood to be quite accessible. On my last morning there I had a lovely coffee at the Precita Park cafe which is very close...the food being served looked tasty.	0

3798	2330	There is a refrigerator, desk, tv, and travelers information about getting around San Francisco. Basically anything we will need during our stay. The place was very clean, stylish, and homely.	0
3806	2335	The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. Tyler stays on the third floor of the house. Free parking on the street  and we were always able to find a spot.	0
3808	2336	The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. One night, Tyler saved us a spot and moved his car to the street and told us to text him when we arrived so he could give us his spot. We drove from the house to downtown SF and it was about a 25 minute drive with traffic.	0
3812	2338	The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay.

3817	2341	Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay. Tyler has clearly put a batch of effort into ensuring his place feels like a hotel, but to be honest it didn’t feel like a hotel, it felt so much better - a home. Tyler provided us with all the space we required but was also available for any questions and tips as we needed them and after meeting him and his partner we feel like we now have a couple of new lifelong friends.	0
3821	2345	The location is great too - near lots of bar and restaurants  The room has so many personal touches and Tyler has thought of every small detail from iPhone chargers, bath robes to ear plugs. The style of the room is super  cool too - it feels like staying in a room at the ace hotel. We only had two days to explore SF so we only used this room as a base but would love to have spent more time here.	0

No detail is too small for Tyler, even down to having chargers ready on both sides of the bed.	0
3840	2356	This was one of the all right Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. We stayed at Tyler's place to visit San Francisco at the end of our roadtrip through the states. When we arrived we were allready briefed on how to check in and we also recieved some guideline .	0

3854	2365	Highly recommended. Just perfect. The place was easy to find, with enough places to park.	0
3856	2366	Just perfect. Check in was so smooth, and we were taken away with how much thought had been made in every possible way. The mini fridge had beverages and snacks, which we particularly enjoyed after our long journey.	0
3858	2367	Just perfect. The space was beautiful with a real relaxing atmosphere. It was a reasonable 20 minute walk to mission district where we were spoilt for choice in food and barroom options.	0
3868	2375	The location and view was also just as excellent as advertised. I highly recommend Farmhouse Kitchen: wowowowow. If you're looking for a spot to stay, there's a reason this is Airbnb is a plus location and we'll gladly vouch for our experience.	0
3870	2377	He worked hard to make sure April and I had everything that we needed, which exceeded our expectations. Tyler spoke to April and I to see what our interests were in food and entertainment then proceeded to make suggestions for food in the Mission District, as well as other places around San Francisco. Our main reason for visiting the area was to attend an Oakland Raiders game.	0
3875	2380	Tyler’s room was about a 20 minute flat walk to the 24th street mission BART station which was very convenient. Communication was great, Tyler gave a ton of amazing recommendations. Location is also a plus, it’s in a great area of SF that has a great vibe - lots of places to eat, drink and shop.	0
3877	2381	Communication was great, Tyler gave a ton of amazing recommendations. When we explored beyond the Mission district, we took Ubers pretty much everywhere (super easy) but I’m sure public transport would’ve been equally convenient. The room has everything you need - EVERYTHING!	0

3882	2383	Hairdryer, straighteners, mini fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks, amazing bath and hair products, even phone chargers on both sides of the bed. The living area upstairs is beautiful, with an amazing view of SF from the balcony. Deborah Hines and his partner were both very hospitable, even invited us to have a glass of champagne when Deborah Hines’s family came over to visit.	0
3886	2385	You definitely don’t get that experience in a hotel! Bennie Dudgeon's place is amazing. Considering the fact that there aren't that many hotel outside of downtown SF, this Airbnb is better than having a hotel in the neighborhood of Bernal Heights.	0
3894	2391	Very clean, high tech room with a super comfy bed, really nice shower. Although we didn’t really use the shared space  we checked it out and it is lovely with spectacular views of the city. Only possible drawback for some guests is that the stairs are quite steep and numerous so carrying a large or heavy suitcase could be a challenge.	0
3907	2399	This is an amazing find in a city crowded with excellent listings. I was able to get some work done in the common space while taking in the skyline. Even had a quick chat with Tyler, who shared some great local recommendation .	0
3912	2402	We met Tyler and his partner on the first night, they were both really kind. The location is very not close to the attractions of SF, but with a lot of cafes around, so still very convenient to live here, and taking Uber to anywhere is also easy to manage.	0
3916	2404	My husband and I had a lovely stay and really appreciated how well stocked the space was. As someone who commutes by foot regularly, I thought it was easy to walk to the Mission District and the BART. The only thing I didn’t love was not having a lock on our bedroom door, though we had no trouble during our stay.	0
3918	2405	My husband and I had a lovely stay and really appreciated how well stocked the space was. As all the other reviews say, wow. The experience here is truly seamless-- Tyler is immensely thoughtful, super responsive and considerate.	0

Tyler's home was perfect for my quick trip in SF and I hope to stay here again if I visit in the future. Thank you Tyler!	0
3936	2416	Speaking of the bed, it's really comfortable and perfect for resting after a day of hiking the hills of San Francisco, and Tyler provides multiple sheet options for you which is a nice touch. On a clear day you can see from Twin Peaks right across to the skyscrapers of the financial district and everything in between. Tyler is a super friendly host, and has plenty of tips for places to visit in the local area.	0
3956	2428	Check in was fast and easy with clear instructions. Tyler is also very friendly (he's definitely up for chats, & has good recommendations for places to visit in SF) and accommodating,  allowing me to leave my luggages at a corner when I travelled out to another city for 2 days. All I can say is over here, you can expect a quality stay.	0

4008	2460	Janet Luckman place is like everything you want from a boutique hotel with none of the bother of dealing with other guests or the awkward encounters that sometimes come with them. There's one short flight of stairs, so you've got to be all right with that, but the building has a kind of Baker Street charm and the location is great. About a 10 min walk from the BART and a short stroll to lots of neighborhood spots.	0

4162	2556	If you’re visiting San Francisco for the first time I absolutely recommend staying at Tyler’s home, just make sure you check out Outerlands (across the street) for the best brunch in the city! Tyler’s place is great and even if you travel with kids, 4 people can fit easily. Tyler replies fast to any question and finds a solution to any issue that might arise.	0
4165	2558	The description of the apartment is very accurate and in the folder he has prepared, you can find any information you need about the apartment but also the neighborhood and useful tips for San Francisco.

4172	2562	There’s tons of places to eat and grab coffee, just a few blocks from the house. We had so much fun and can’t wait to come back some day. Thanks, Tyler!	0
4175	2564	My boyfriend and I spent a week in San Francisco to celebrate our anniversary and see his friend , so we wanted a place close to the city but also close to the beach. Luis Hawkins home is not only gorgeous, but super cute and comfortable. It had adorable little touch , and we especially appreciated Luis Hawkins home manual with food recommendations.	0
4196	2577	There were extra blankets, which was fantastic. The temperature of the place was my only complaint as there is no Central heat or air, however he provided a radiator to heat and a fan to cool. Tyler was easy to communicate with and gave good recommendations for places to eat.	0

4208	2585	This was a nice little place for a one night stay in the city. The space itself was really small (especially the bathroom) but it was nice for just one night and you better be comfortable with the person you’re staying with since it is very close quarters. Not sure if it is the hosts who live upstairs but be prepared for some noise, we heard a lot of stomping around upstairs well past midnight and up again early in the a.m. That didn’t bother us toooo much and we really appreciated the glass water bottles, option of having coffee in the morning, FULL LENGTH MIRROR is always a huge plus in my book, and a record player with actually good record options!	0
4210	2586	This was a nice little place for a one night stay in the city. The topographic point is right next to a beautiful park that we walked to in the afternoon it was just really nice. Thanks for a lovely stay Angela!	0

4227	2597	"Angela's place somehow embodied stylish & at home all in one.

It was a 20 min drive to all the ""touristy"" things we wanted to do & a 5 min walk to the nearest bus stop."	0
4229	2598	"It was a 20 min drive to all the ""touristy"" things we wanted to do & a 5 min walk to the nearest bus stop. We loved the little book of suggestions that she had, also. Her TV was connected to netflix so it was nice to relax before bed while watching our favorite shows."	0
4232	2600	She also has plates, cups, coffee, and oatmeal available. You really can't beat this place! Hotels in town are so much more expensive and don't offer all the amenities that she had.	0
4250	2610	My wife and I are not bothered by a lack of toilet privacy but in case you are staying with another person, just take it into consideration! Overall, it was a wonderfully low-cost option and I would stay there again and recommend it to others.	0
4251	2611	Angela’s place is perfect for a solo traveler or a couple. It had amazing touches (record player!) and was overall great.	0
4259	2616	This studio is small but packs a batch of punches! The location was a true Airbnb in that you are in a neighbourhood, but still close to restaurants and BART (Mission). We especially enjoyed the tea/coffee/breakfast nook with its kettle!	0
4261	2618	We had no problems with this. If you do not have a car, San Francisco is hilly and the neighbourhood here is no exception.	0
4263	2619	Angela's little studio was just what I needed for 2 days in SF. The room had all the amenities you would need for a comfortable stay. Check in was simple and you can do so any time since it's a self-check-in process.	0

The weather was great when we visited, so we loved the balcony.	0
4283	2633	This suite has the home away from home feel, with some added luxury. When my wife and I were researching honeymoon locations, no hotel matched up to what we were looking for. This topographic point exceeded our expectations and then some.	0
4286	2635	Had an incredible stay at Kelly's place. The suite is massive, modern, well-outfitted and an excellent value. We were particularly impressed by the luxurious bathroom (probably the nicest of any AirBnb I've stayed in!	0
4288	2636	The suite is massive, modern, well-outfitted and an excellent value. ), the private deck and the gorgeous views of Mount Sutro.

4320	2653	Also, the bathroom is probably the nicest part of the place. Teresa Knight is very responsive and easy to communicate with. Overall, if you can book this topographic point it is WORTH it!	0
4325	2656	We loved this place! Kelly was really easy to chat to and let us check in early and leave our bags late so we didn’t have to carry our bags around. Check in was super simple.	0
4339	2664	Kelly's master suite is a FANTASTIC place to stay in the city.

4366	2679	Actually tried to come back on my tax return to SF but sadly it was already booked. Slept very well in the comfortable bed with divine sheets. Remember if you require a kettle to ask Teresa Knight and he will happily provide one.	0
4367	2680	Remember if you require a kettle to ask Jeff and he will happily provide one. Two recommendations - for great coffee and breakfast around the cnr visit Jane Cafe which opens early and Delfina Pizzeria for a casual dinner just next door.	0
4375	2684	Can’t say enough about this rental and the host ! !	0
4380	2687	Funky artwork throughout, which we appreciated. Bed was very comfy, water pressure was excellent in the shower. We really enjoyed the neighborhood—nothing sketchy, and plenty of good places to eat.	0

4558	2792	I totally get it about no tv - there’s enough to do outside that you don’t need indoor entertainment. We just like to have the news on as we wake up and fall asleep. We had a great time and are totally giving 5 stars.	0
4565	2797	Chris & Tim made great recommendations for us and we are so appreciative of the attentiveness. Next time we’re in the area, we would love to stay here again! thank you!	0
4568	2798	Next time we’re in the area, we would love to stay here again! Chris and Luis Hawkins were wonderful!! From the very start, they answered our questions quickly and were willing to help us with each step of the planning process.	0
4569	2799	Chris and Tim were wonderful!! The cottage was very clean, with all the amenities you would need for an enjoyable stay. It is close to Shore Drive, but yet seems very private, thanks to a beautiful garden area.	0
4574	2801	There is even an outdoor shower and all sorts of beach items for guests to use. They are so knowing about the area and have countless tips for restaurants, activities and even gave us a heads up on the weather! We would absolutely stay again the next time we are in town.	0
4575	2802	There is even an outdoor shower and all sorts of beach items for guests to use. Don’t miss booking this gem.	0
4576	2802	There is even an outdoor shower and all kind of beach items for guest to use. Don’t miss booking this gem.	0
4577	2803	The cottage was cozy and peaceful, in a quiet neighborhood right by the beach. It was within walking distance of a bunch of restaurants, as well. The space was serene, the bed was comfy, and if we had wanted to cook, there was a fully-equipped kitchen available.	0
4582	2806	Thanks again! Lois Davis is a super host, and definitely one of the most kind and thoughtful people I've met through Airbnb. Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach.	0
4585	2808	Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach. and borrow them. She also had good suggestions on local places to go, restaurants and pubs etc.	0
4593	2812	This topographic point is worth the money! The airplane overhead were especially loud when we stayed (which didn't bother us because we were so exhausted from the beach), but Melissa was kind enough to ask if we had slept okay. If I can, I would DEFINITELY book this room again.	0
4594	2813	This place is worth the money! I think you never regret if you will chose Melisa's house. The bed is my ideal (7 pillows ) and bathroom is very pretty, Melisa really ready for everything, if you forgot towels, shampoo, soap, sunscreen, she can give all it for you; location little far to beach, but you can take bike and less than 10 minutes you will be on the beach; never try to buy something in beach cafe, it's too expensive.	0
4597	2814	I think you never regret if you will chose Bennie Dudgeon's house. There is Food Lion not so far from house and you can drink coffee every morning. So I am sure you will love this place.	0
4599	2815	I think you never regret if you will chose Cher Alexander's house. P.S. She has a guitar and uke 	0
4602	2817	Melissa's place is not fancy, but it was within cycling distance of the beach and restaurants, and she was friendly and helpful with dining suggestions. I saw Melissa at checkin but got up early and left. The house was quiet.	0
4605	2819	A great getaway spot! My husband and I took a few days together away from the kids to enjoy the beach & this place was perfect - cute, clean, and walking distance from the beach and almost every restaurant & activity we enjoyed during our trip. Star & Austin were great hosts and checked in with us several times throughout the visit to make sure we had everything we needed.	0
4607	2820	Star & Austin were great hosts and checked in with us several times throughout the visit to make sure we had everything we needed. We especially liked that they had a chalkboard with their restaurant recommendations in the room & we checked several of them out!	0
4626	2831	Thank you for an easy, comfortable stay! I highly recommend and would stay here again!	0
4641	2840	It was our first time in Virginia Beach, and it has won over our hearts... and our stay at Star and Austin’s place played a huge role in that experience. Their place was super cozy and had such amazing amenities. Our favorite thing to do was to take the bikes out to roam about the city, stopping by cute local stores and listening to late night music jams.	0

Our favorite thing to do was to take the bikes out to roam about the city, stopping by cute local stores and listening to late night music jams.	0
4646	2842	Pamela Drew and Star were accommodating from the beginning. We were driving from Lehigh Valley, PA., and knew we would get in a lot sooner than the 3 PM check-in. Star allowed us to check in earlier upon our arrival.	0
4651	2845	I would definitely come back to their residence again, and you will not be disappointed! My girlfriend and my experience at Star and Debra Dibble’s place was better than expected. Star and Debra Dibble were responsive and were accurate in their description.	0
4653	2846	Star and Clifford Winkler were responsive and were accurate in their description. They provided all the information we would need upon booking/leading up to our check in like how to self check in which was good. The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked.	0
4660	2851	This place surpassed our expectations. We packed a bunch of toiletries that they already provided which was so kind! They provided: body wash, shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, an iron, and a first aid kit.	0
4663	2853	The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. The place was also spotless! I usually do a rub down of any hotel we book and I didn’t need to here.	0
4664	2854	The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. There were no spaces ignored. It’s obvious these owners really care about the space and your stay- they checked in with us on a few occasions.	0
4665	2855	The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. We are hoping to visit again soon and try out another one of their locations! Thank you Star & Austin, this air b n b was one of the highlights of our trip.	0
4666	2856	We are hoping to visit again soon and try out another one of their locations! Christine’s place was awesome! My wife and I came here for a long weekend and really enjoyed ourselves.	0
4679	2863	Extremely clean and the host was very quick to respond/help with anything. Saved us money on Uber drive and were also just fun. Loved this place and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area!	0
4681	2865	It is attached to her home but feels very secluded with separate, outside access around the side. Keeping this in mind we were respectful of the host and they of use - I did not hear or see anyone the whole time, making for a private stay. The place is clean and well equipped - including coffee and creamer, which is very nice!	0
4682	2866	Keeping this in mind we were respectful of the host and they of use - I did not hear or see anyone the whole time, making for a private stay. My wife and I brought our own bikes, even though there were beach cruisers provided and it is very easy to bike from the house to the boardwalk bike path and back. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to getaway for a long weekend and will keep it in mind for our future trips!	0
4683	2867	Keeping this in mind we were respectful of the host and they of use - I did not hear or see anyone the whole time, making for a private stay. Great location,  close to beach, parks and restaurants, but also private and cozy. The inside space was lovely and very comfortable.	0
4686	2869	The inside space was lovely and very comfortable. The outside was also very nice with pretty landscaping and a view of  a small wetland area and golf course. Really appreciated the private patio area too.	0
4687	2870	Really appreciated the private patio area too. Bikes were a little tricky to ride when you’re not used to “chopper”style handlebars and are accustomed to handbrakes. But definitely a very nice space.	0
4692	2873	Good off street parking. We had more than enough space and the entire lot is very private with a beautiful backyard if you want to take a few moments to observe nature. Wish we had stayed longer, but if/when we return to the beachfront we'll definitely be keeping Jeremy Johnson's place in mind!	0
4696	2876	We both felt super comfortable and Christine responded immediately to our questions when we checked in. Not sure what renting bikes elsewhere would have costed but the ease of use with these and being able to ride them everywhere back and forth made the trip that much better. I recommend Christine’s place for anyone visiting Virginia beach!	0
4705	2881	The place was fabulous! Some things you should know....  1) it only takes 4 1/2 minutes to walk to the beach! 2) the place is bigger than it seems in the picture (and really nicely kept)  3) her recommendation were spot on.	0
4711	2886	You have a separate private entrance, full bathroom, room, living room, and a covered outdoor area. There is a door that separates your place and Erik Dickson’s half of the home. In the living room area, there is a mini fridge (not freezer) and microwave in addition to a coffee machine.	0
4720	2892	Great location, great value, comfortable beds, large bedrooms. I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. Mona responded nearly immediately to any messages, and was extremely accommodating for letting us bring our two dogs.	0
4724	2894	I wish we could have stayed long to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. Robert Turpen had a list of restaurants and things to do in the area that was a very nice touch. The neighborhood seemed very safe.	0
4735	2900	Immaculately clean. The screen in porch is nothing short of magical. The nature in the backyard is, too.	0
4741	2903	We got a wonderful nights sleep. Crystal Romero was so quick to respond and fantastic to talk to. Her restaurant/amenity suggestion list was really helpful.	0
4742	2904	We got a wonderful nights sleep. The neighborhood is so quiet and safe. Do yourself a favor and book to stay here as long as you can!	0
4748	2908	All very clean and well kept. Our favorite part was the fenced backyard for my pup and the screened in porch. Perfect for relaxing with coffee in the morning (there's a microwave, mini fridge and coffee station with coffee and tea).	0
4752	2911	The screened in porch with hammock where you can look out over a little tributary is so peaceful! I recommend traveling with a sleep mask if early light can wake you up as the sun does poor into the bedroom behind the shade. We went to the beach the night we arrived, which was just a short little drive, no more than 15 minutes with traffic.	0
4766	2918	The place is decorated super cunning and trendy. Wish we could have stayed longer! !	0
4772	2923	We also thought the locals were extremely friendly. It actually felt like staying at a friend's house (right down to the stocked keurig and cold beer in the fridge!). You can tell they love their home and we felt lucky to be able to stay there.	0
4782	2930	Thanks again, Brent! I will never stay at a hotel for vacation again, this experience spoiled me & my family. Brent and Lois Davis introduced themselves to us on our 2nd day due to our late check-in, they were both so very friendly, they made us feel right at home.	0
4785	2932	They both were super quick to reply to any questions or requests that we made,  our whole experience was AWESOME! My family had an amazing beach week at The Carriage House! Convenient location, just steps from the sand!	0
4788	2934	My family had an amazing beach week at The Carriage House! Bedrooms were clean, and all was comfortable. Kitchen area was great, stocked with all of the appliances, cookware & dishes we needed.	0
4789	2935	Kitchen area was great, stocked with all of the appliances, cookware & dishes we needed. We appreciated all of the extra touches -- the coffee bar, snacks, the bottle of wine! A lot of pride and thoughtfulness goes into making this stay what it is!	0
4798	2941	This place is perfect for a family vacation. The house is on the beach and that makes everything so easy when you have a 2 years old with you. Brent's place was spotless, very cozy and made us feel like home.	0
4799	2942	Brent's place was spotless, very cozy and made us feel like home. I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. Also I have to say that the communication with him was above expectations since we went there a week after the hurricane Florence and I was so worried about the weather and the beach, but Brent was honest and so helpful answering to all my questions.	0
4801	2943	I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. He gave us some tips where to eat and do some groceries and that helped also. We can't wait to come back next year!	0
4802	2943	I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's topographic point for our vacation. He gave us some tip where to eat and do some groceries and that helped also. We can't wait to come back next year!	0
4804	2945	I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. The cottage is walking distance to the beach. Only downside is the cottage is above the garage but I'm an early riser so it didn't bother me at all.	0
4807	2946	The cottage is walking distance to the beach. It has 2 very comfortable queen sized beds, beautiful shower, comfy couch with 2 extra chairs, board games, playing cards, and wine glasses already chilling in the deep-freeze upon your arrival. There is a full kitchen and it is stocked with pots and pans, dishes, silverware, condiments, coffee pot, coffee and tea.	0
4811	2948	This has definitely become my home away from home. This place is adorable. Cozy 2 bedroom upstairs cottage... with kitchen and life room.	0
4813	2950	It has everything you may need inside the house, and it’s a great location. (about 8 min drive to airport, and very close to many restaurants) We loved our time in Brent’s cottage. One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located.	0
4817	2952	One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located. I sometimes felt like I wished I could lock the bathroom door for privacy- but it wasn’t that large of a deal. I would totally go back!	0
4823	2956	My family and I had a wonderful experience at The Carriage house. A nice accommodation was the outdoor shower when coming from the beach. Having the peaceful outdoor area also added to a great experience!	0
4826	2959	The kids playground across the street and dinning/shopping area within a couple minute drive. We enjoyed the easy check in/check out and the way the place is set up. Brent is very responsive and available to provide any help and answer any questions.	0
4832	2962	She messaged a couple days prior to update us on our early check in request, checked in with us after we arrived to make sure we were able to settle in and to see if we needed anything. If my travels bring me back to the area, I will most certainly look to rebook here!	0
4834	2963	Katherine's thoughtfully furnished room felt more like a self sufficient home. We had everything we needed and then some. She had a huge variety of teas and coffee to choose from.	0
4839	2966	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and we only wish we could have stayed a few more days. We highly recommend Luis Hawkins home for her thoughtfulness and responsiveness.	0
4842	2969	She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. For supper I went next-door for a takeaway tuna dinner which I enjoyed on my private patio. I continued my beach reading in the most comfortable lounge chair ever.	0
4845	2971	She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. Katherine's place was really clean and really comfortable. It's a good size for one person or a couple.	0
4847	2972	She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. The light was really nice as well. We really enjoyed the kitchenette, which was stocked with plastic silverware, coffee, tea, sugar, and had a coffee maker and electric kettle.	0
4850	2974	I appreciated the special care Katherine took to ensure our comfortable stay. The walk to the beach is short and lets out in kind of a private area since the access is through a regular neighborhood. I had a great stay and would definitely come again	0
4858	2978	And the bathtub!!! Super great soaks at night. The bed is like sinking into a pillow...I slept 9 hours each night!	0
4874	2987	Would gladly stay again! Me and my boyfriend decided to visit Virginia Beach for few days in the peak season and Katherine’s place looked the best on this website according the price and the accessibility to the beach! When we arrived, it turned out to be so much better than we expected because we could just walk to the beach and to the local restaurants without using our car.	0
4878	2989	Would gladly stay again! If I’ll have the opportunity to go again to Virginia Beach, I’ll chose Katherine’s topographic point ! Best,  Adelina	0
4879	2990	Would gladly stay again! 5 Star Review for 5 Star Hosts  My husband is having a series of surgeries near by and having Kara and Nick’s place to come back to was a retreat at the end of some stressful days. The property is as described and then some, though it rained I was not able to sit outside on the lovely deck, I did get to see some wildlife, a hawk and an eagle.	0
4882	2992	Their communication is excellent and we even lost power for an hour or two and they were quick to let me know of its return. They have considered everything and even left a bottle of wine. The bed is comfy, the bathroom spacious with little amenities in case one forgets the essentials.	0
4889	2997	Their place is truly a respite. Especially suited for contemplation, writing, or long conversations with a loved one over beverage of choice while watching the sunset gently over the water. It is great to have a full kitchen and they leave nice notes and treats for the guests.	0
4893	2999	Their place is truly a respite. My daughter and I stayed at Wiseacre over Easter weekend and enjoyed every second of our stay. Chuck and Charlotte are most hospitable!	0
4898	3001	Their place is truly a respite. I certainly was not surprised to just learn that John Mullins home was featured in Reader's Digest as a top airbnb in the state Virginia. An absolute gem of a place!	0
4904	3004	There were seven of us in total who stayed there for six nights. tons of beautiful space to entertain us. Both inside and out.	0
4910	3007	Couldn’t tell that from inside the house, central air kept us nice and cool. My two youngest and I had the benches in the great room for our bed . We found them very comfortable.	0
4916	3011	No one was cramped. Played a lot of different games as well that we set up and borrowed from Chuck. It is amazing everything you might have forgotten to bring he has and shares with you.	0
4924	3015	A true godsend when you are many miles from home! Chuck made us feel like we were at our home away from home!! We will definitely be staying here again!	0
4926	3016	We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you again for everything (Website hidden by Airbnb) ❤ (Website hidden by Airbnb) Staci & Devin	0
4927	3017	Everything about the location of this home was fantastic, both the water-front lot the home is on, and the proximity to the best that Norfolk has to offer. The wide, 2 story picture window view of Lake Whitehurst is alive with nature and tranquil with its beauty. His home is a real treat to discover with the unique architecture.	0
4931	3019	Robert Turpen is a consummate host, who sincerely cares about his guests. The house has so many great features that you just have to visit to find out what its all about. We chose his place because it was so close to the Norfolk Botanical Garden, which I highly recommend.	0
4937	3023	Chuck is a wealth of information, knowledge, traveled experiences, amazing people he was worked with/for, you will not regret staying here, I promise you. I'm a veteran Airbnb'er and my reviews are always honest to help that next future guest. For what it is worth, we will be back as we have formed a new friend at Wiseacre.	0
4942	3025	At Wiseacre, you can expect a superb host, warm and relaxing surroundings that will make you smile, and a stay that you will remember in your heart. Every amenity listed is indeed there, but words in descriptions don't really do the topographic point justice. You have to see for yourself.	0
4943	3026	Every amenity listed is indeed there, but words in descriptions don't really do the place justice. Chuck immediately makes you feel at home, listens, and does everything he can to help you get what you're looking for in an Air B and B experience. His suggestions for things to do when we were out exploring were all spot on and nothing you'd find in any guide book or brochure.	0
4948	3030	Chuck was the most gracious, funny, warming, magical host. In our 4.679 years of dating this was the best place for us to retreat, recover, and nourish our souls. I will be back over and over and over again.	0
4954	3033	Right. Now. Until next time Charismatic Roberta Hallenbeck and Charming Charlotte.	0
4957	3035	Great place! My friends and I booked Chuck's place for a fun weekend at VA beach. We didn't know that there was a music festival going on at the same time but Chuck let us know and recommended some great beaches at the Chesapeake Bay that were not crowded at all.	0
4959	3036	My friends and I booked Raquel Eastham's place for a fun weekend at VA beach. We also cooked all of our meals and Raquel Eastham would run the dishwasher and put away the dishes while we were away which was so convenient and thoughtful. He even had put out a individualized sign welcoming our group.	0
4963	3038	We stayed at Wiseacre for an extended holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. The house is exactly as pictured - sprawling, unique, and welcoming. We found the bed to be very comfortable, the bathroom and kitchen to be modern and well-appointed, and the space very accommodating for relaxing and refreshing both inside and out.	0
4966	3040	We stayed at Wiseacre for an extended holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. Enjoy!	0
4972	3044	Chuck even provided an abundant bowl of candy in each room, I found this inspired. Needed a quick stay in Virginia beach as it was a last minute trip, found Chucks house and immediately booked it. Afterwards we discovered that he lives on the property, i’ve stayed in many air bnbs but never one with a live in host, so we were a bit curious / anxious as to how it would go, however it was amazing!	0
4973	3045	Chuck even provided an abundant bowl of candy in each room, I found this inspired. Chuck was so awesome and welcoming, and the house is so quirky and fun. Even though he had little to no notice we were booking that night he accommodated us and everything was more than perfect!	0
4980	3048	Deborah Hines was really good at answering our questions and giving us advice of places near by. Deborah Hines being in the house was the only concern, but it didn't even feel like he was in the house with us. The location is also perfect, 2 minutes away from stores like Food Lion, 3-5 minutes away from East Beach, 15-20 mins away from the center of VA Beach, and if you really want to go in the lake, the first bit of the lake is shallow and will only reach your knees.	0
4982	3049	Lori Stewart was really good at answering our questions and giving us advice of places near by. There are plenty of restaurants to go eat at if you want to eat out. Over all, I would recommend this place to anyone, you won't regret it.	0
4983	3050	There are plenty of restaurants to go eat at if you want to eat out. Our group had 12 people and there was still space for more. :)	0
4999	3062	But obviously it has. And it should for hosts that deserve to be successful for their attempt . For good reason.	0
5002	3064	The cabin has ample space for my family of three. It has a batch of plaything and books to keep my little one entertained. The kitchen is well stocked.	0
5003	3065	The kitchen is well stocked. The bed in the main bedroom is comfy. We had very good night sleep.	0
5004	3066	The bed in the main bedroom is comfy. The bathroom is the only space that feels small but it’s not a big deal. The location is a short drive from several museums although it’s far away from stores and restaurants.	0
5013	3072	Geneva is quick to respond to messages and flexible. Jeneva’s cabin was so wonderful to stay in! I really liked all of the sticky notes, those were extremely helpful especially for the shower.	0
5020	3076	The cabin was an excellent place for us to stop for a night before flying home after a holiday visit to the Northwest. It was tucked away in a residential neighborhood, but easy to transition back to the interstate. We loved all the special touch that Jeneva had added to the cabin.	0
5025	3079	My son and I stayed here while in the area for a night. We loved our time in Tony and Attina's tiny house. They did an amazing job with the small space--very cute beach/island theme inside.	0
5036	3087	"As an individual guest, I found this space to be absolutely perfect. Tony and Attina have  laid out the minimal space in such a way that all needs were met -- beyond what I had expected. And sitting out on their deck on a cool spring evening was just the ""bee's knees""."	0

5039	3088	Pamela Drew and Attina have  laid out the minimal space in such a way that all needs were met -- beyond what I had expected. I TOTALLY recommend this sweet location to anyone wanting to give themselves an extra nightlong treat.	0
5042	3091	Thought out. Friendly. Comfortable bed and plenty of pillows!	0
5043	3092	Friendly. Pretty much everything you could dream of for a tiny house! This was our first tiny house stay and it blew us away.	0
5047	3094	Edward Ramsey and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. Can't recommend enough. My husband and I just needed a night away and this place was private and cozy, exactly what we needed.	0
5048	3095	Tony and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. Oh, and don't miss the view!	0
5049	3095	Cher Alexander and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. Oh, and don't miss the position !	0
5050	3096	This place was great! Amazing view and perfect for snuggling! We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, snacks, water, and a fridge.	0

5072	3110	We arrived late driving down from Poulsbo after spending time with family on Easter. It was late and we had no problem getting settled in when we arrived. We were pooped and called it a night.	0
5083	3116	Robert Huckabaa and Attina were there as needed, friendly when we saw them and eager to make our stay fantastic, even giving us a late check out which was very much appreciated. The beach and parks are a short drive and the history of the area was fun to discover. Stay here if ever in the area.	0
5084	3117	Stay here if ever in the area. The Aloha house is simply perfect! Everything you need in a small but still cozy place!	0
5086	3118	The Aloha house is simply perfect! Warm welcome even if we didn't have the opportunity to meet Troy and Attina. Communications were clear and responses came quite quickly and were loaded with useful informations about the house and also about our visit in Seattle.	0

5766	3523	We had the upstairs room  and while it said a shared bathroom I think we were the lone ones using it.

5771	3526	This was the perfect place for us to stay in while in town for a family reunion. Esmie and her husband are perfect hosts and made us feel comfortable in their home. Although there were several other rented rooms downstairs, the house was quiet and our space felt private.	0

6339	3874	We weren’t prepared for a 12pm check out as we planned for 1pm per what was on Airbnb. Linda/Mike thought we knew it was a 12pm check out and when we told our hosts we thought 1pm, they did not rush us at all, even though they had to prep for their next reservations at 2pm. We did our best to rush check out as it was a miscommunication that was not on Linda/Mike.	0

6393	3904	We realized right away that Miranda Malone and Edwin Green could easily charge twice the amount they are asking for each night, just because of the value of the place alone.

6402	3910	I'm not going to bury the lede on this one: the toilet lights up. That's all I needed to start the petition for 10 stars on Airbnb. Now to the boring part of the review: Debra Dibble and Roberta Hallenbeck's suite was exactly what I was looking for on my one-night stay.	0
6405	3912	That's all I needed to start the petition for 10 stars on Airbnb. As a cold-natured person, the heated blanket was a mega-bonus (besides the toilet - don't forget the toilet). Great stay!	0

6481	3960	The queen bed was very comfortable, and the gas fireplace kept the cottage plenty warm. The french doors in the living room open out on to a very nice deck, with a view across the yard to the water, and across to the mainland.

6494	3969	The kitchen is basic and rustic, not suitable for extensive cooking, but it had everything I needed. Chip is a great host and his dog Olive is the sweetest! It's so nice being so close to the water.	0

You can see the water from the main living space and from the porch, and you can walk down to the rocky beach itself at low tide. Chip's house is just across the lawn, but not visible from the cottage.	0

6887	4216	There are six outlets, and although only four of them work, that's plenty for one room. The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. The towels he provides are very soft and very plentiful.	1
6889	4217	The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. Joseph Lewis was having some electrical issues in the bathroom, so he put in a lamp. However, in the daytime, sun shines in through the skylight, providing natural light in the bathroom.	1
6896	4222	Being kind of young, we were a bit apprehensive about meeting him, but he put us at ease completely. He was completely un-creepy, which can sometimes be hard to find in older men as an East Asian - American. I appreciated his conversation and his exhilaration at sharing the house with us.	1
6898	4223	I appreciated his conversation and his excitement at sharing the house with us. He's a lovely, kind man World Health Organization doesn't unnecessarily interfere with his guests and makes sure that we treat the house as if we were his roommates. I felt at ease and well rested at Sheri Vowell place!	1
6899	4224	He's a lovely, kind man who doesn't unnecessarily interfere with his guests and makes sure that we treat the house as if we were his roommates. Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood. The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.	1
6904	4227	Our four days at this incredible loft were some of our favorite traveling days to date! The loft is amazing, clean, and broad . We enjoyed coffee on the terrace overlooking the street.	1
6910	4232	It was BEAUTIFUL and the bed was the MOST comfortable we have ever slept on. Dasha responded quickly anytime for anything we asked. We loved they had coffee in the unit and creamer in the fridge.	1
6919	4237	This was Brian and mine once a year get away from the responsibilities of life (kids, dogs, careers) and we loved the ability to “Shelton Gill and chill” w each other. We want to come back soon for a quick weekend getaway and maybe bring the kids next time. Although we would have to have a different unit for the kids, we would definitely try to stay at one of Dasha’s properties (she has a few to choose from).	1
6927	4243	A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use. On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan.	1

6936	4249	The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were lots of little extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of games for us to play after a long day on our feet.

6940	4251	I traveled with my mom and my kids and we were comfortable, delighted, and fell in love with the area. Walking to the many parks nearby, and to Taylor St for dinner and dessert - we even found a bit of our personal family history as 3 generations ago our family lived in the same area. Ken was a fantastic communicator and the small touches throughout the Coach House made our stay so easy and seamless.	1
6950	4257	The beautiful, modern guest house is thoughtfully set up for guests with everything including light switches labeled...instructions next to all appliances...plenty of cooking supplies and (Website hidden by Airbnb) conditioning...toiletries and comfy towels...plus plenty of visitor info and personal travel recommendations from the host. Loved the security features and felt very comfortable walking about though as in all areas of the city, you should use good street sense if venturing very far on foot. We did walk to the Jewel grocery store—which was an easy distance though I would be cautious doing so after dark (as you would do anywhere in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) special concerns).	1
6958	4261	We loved all the extra touches — great art and stylish space, snacks and nespresso, a booklet full of Chicago suggestions, extra Ventra cards, and even classical music playing upon our arrival! Their place is also close to the pink and blue lines making it really easy to travel downtown. We did Uber Pool a couple of times and it cost anywhere between $5-$7 one way to get downtown.	1
6960	4262	We did Uber Pool a couple of times and it cost anywhere between $5-$7 one way to get downtown. We were in the city to see Lori Stewart, but also went to the Art Institute Chicago and ate dinner at the Blue Door. Their place was easy to travel to between all those places.	1
6967	4267	Nathan is an incredibly gracious host. Did I mention, Nathan's topographic point is bad buttocks ? Haha, seriously.	1
6975	4271	The photograph of this place do not do justice to how lovely, warm and full of thoughtful touches it is. And ofcourse, how can I not mention about the cutest, warmest cat I've ever met and that's Sir Dumpling! He is so adorable and I had a lovely time playing with him even though I am not an animal lover and a little paranoid around pets.	1
6976	4272	He is so adorable and I had a lovely time playing with him even though I am not an animal lover and a little paranoid around pets. To sum it up,  the place felt like home and we would love to come and stay here whenever we are back at Chicago :)	1

7013	4294	Being a loft apartment, the bedroom isn't the most private but it was fine for me. His flamboyant rooftop is certainly a highlight of the place, especially if the weather is good. One of the most memorable moments of my trip was sitting out on the rooftop with a very friendly couple who were also staying with Robert Turpen through airbnb.	1
7017	4296	Michael even came to join us for a while. The location is antic . The apartment is very cardinal and in one of the most popular parts of town.	1
7020	4298	Michael offers some ear plugs though, so unless you're a light sleeper you should be okay. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and I'd happily return. Thanks, Michael!	1
7027	4302	The amenities provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush? not to worry! it's there!)!	1
7035	4307	Michael thinks of everything, anticipating his guests' every need. Hope we can stay with him again. If you're going to be in or around the loop, the location is perfect, and the price is a bargain.	1
7054	4318	For those that want a real cultural Chicago experience, this topographic point is it. Book this place, you will probably want to move to Chicago.	1
7062	4322	It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. The morning I was checking out, I had the chance to sit and chat with Shantell Preusser on my way out while he prepared for his next guest. What a great, down to earth, knowledgable, compassionate adventure seeker Shantell Preusser is...I loved the narrative he had about the artistic and eccentric atmosphere that his  loft had to offer!	1
7064	4323	It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. I will be back and hope to talk with him again~share stories and learn about new things and places I hadn't known about before! Thank you a million times over Alejandrina Anderson!!	1
7072	4328	We absolutely loved  Lori Stewart place. The very huge Loft is artistically and tastefully furnished. The wide roofgarden filled with a hundred of flowerpots is the best location during breakfast and evening hang out .	1
7074	4329	The wide roofgarden filled with a hundred of flowerpots is the best location during breakfast and evening hang out . We ate breakfast there (when it didn’t rain)and drink wine on the  Sofa like an extended life room under the moonlight during evening with fantastic sound of Joseph Lewis’s music collection . From the roof top you can see the numerous restaurants and bars around , but Clifford Winkler rooftop offers the best location , so why still going to a bar?	1
7077	4331	We had fun and laughed a lot with Michael especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . Sorry for that Michael . Should we come to visit Chicago again sometime , we definitely will stay again in his place.	1
7078	4331	We had fun and laughed a lot with Pamela Drew especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . Sorry for that Pamela Drew . Should we come to visit Chicago again sometime , we definitely will stay again in his place.	1

7093	4340	We loved our time in Chicago and truly enjoyed our time at Joshua’s air bnb!! !	1
7107	4348	The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment.

7111	4350	You can totally get around on public theodolite (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!	1

7125	4359	She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates.	1
7131	4363	He was super friendly and sweet. Gin and her family was very welcoming and friendly with their hospitality. Location is in a very safe quite neighbourhood.	1
7135	4365	Can walk around late at night without problem. Bathroom was awesome clean with all shower products provided. Big super plus bonus if your a dog lover .	1
7138	4367	Overall one of the best Airbnb experience I have to date and will book again when I come back to Chicago. Nice private room, with a firm/squeaky bed. (Just like the description!)	1
7142	4369	Jennifer Merry and Roberta Hallenbeck offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! It was quite warm when we were there and the AC in the room was great. Meatball is the cutest (loudest) house greeter ever, we love him!	1
7144	4370	Marcos Blount and Lois Davis offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! He is very enthusiastic for cuddles, and so sweet! Quick and easy access to downtown, via or the pubs/ restaurant of the area via train, or bus.	1

7151	4375	"The space is exactly as described. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom."	1
7156	4378	My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions.	1
7159	4380	Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago	1
7165	4384	Traci is a professional chef, and she leaves out breakfast option that make 'continental' bloom . They had a couple of bikes for us to use, which made getting around town easy and enjoyable. We got in quite late from the airport, and had no trouble checking in.	1
7169	4387	Treetops is a lovely space, with great natural light from windows and a skylight in the bathroom. The sitting room extends the space, with a small desk and a sofa for relaxed chatting. The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra warmth.	1
7180	4393	Sequoiah was a gem - present, helpful and she gave us some good local tips. A real plus for us was the outdoor shower in the greenhouse. What a delight to be in a private area, yet still feel part of nature.	1
7183	4396	We also love the compost toilet.....very easy to use, hygienic, no odor and very ecological. We’ll definitely return!	1
7193	4402	Laura and Dennis Steward are the most gracious of host . The posted photos don't do their cozy space justice. It's spacious, impeccably clean, well-organized, and full of thoughtful touches that may it feel like you're staying with family.	1
7198	4406	We stayed at Ron and Laurie’s place when we were helping with day care for our granddaughter in the area. Some of those special touches included fresh flowers,  fresh ground coffee, homemade granola and containers of Greek yogurt for breakfast, evening snacks (cookies and tea), and a lovely patio,  The location was GREAT — a block from the 4th Street area in Berkeley, where we always enjoy spending time at our visits to Berkeley. They clearly labeled items as to their location and how various things worked.	1
7221	4418	John Mullins gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. The location is great for getting into San Francisco and we found everything easy and accessible. Thank you so much for the stay!	1
7228	4422	Then to San Francisco where we had lunch in China town and watched the Women's March on Market Street which was HUGE! It is fun and funky and authentically eclectic. The artistic touches and the environmental concern were a plus.	1
7229	4423	The artistic touches and the environmental concerns were a plus. We felt like we were guests of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. You don't need to bring or buy much.	1
7232	4424	We felt like we were guests of Mark and Lauren Jensen's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. Just make yourself at home and do as much or as little as you want. We met Mark and Lauren Jensen at the end of our stay and they are a delightful couple that we hope to see again soon.	1
7237	4427	We felt like we were guests of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. It's a comfortable space in a very convenient location (quick walk to BART station) on a quiet street, and had everything we needed, and more, to make us feel right at home. We slept like logs in the extremely comfortable bed.	1
7240	4429	The kitchen is well-equipped, and the thoughtful touches of eggs, English muffins, milk, coffee, etc., etc. Jenny & Mark are wonderful hosts, who were very quick to respond to messages. We'd love to stay there again.	1
7246	4432	There was a great variety of shops and restaurants nearby - our favourite was a little hole-in-the-wall doughnut shop called Dream Fluff Donuts. The cottage is very quiet, clean and well equipped - everything is exactly as in the AirBnB pictures and description. Lois Davis is very friendly and available if needed but is respectful of our privacy.	1
7247	4433	Susan is very friendly and available if needed but is respectful of our privacy. We would not hesitate to return to the Elmwood cottage!	1
7266	4444	It was such a warm genuine welcome. This was my 3rd visit to the little house and I'm already looking forward to my next visit! Bennie Dudgeon always goes above and beyond to make sure that each and every guest is comfortable - plus the extra touches are like nothing else I've ever experienced in an AirBnb!	1
7270	4447	Diana was the ultimate host! She was both friendly and professional. Her timeliness when I thought I was locked out was also fantastic.	1
7271	4447	Diana was the ultimate host! She was both friendly and professional. Her seasonableness when I thought I was locked out was also fantastic.	1
7272	4448	Diana was the ultimate host! I typically stay in the same hotel each time I visit the East Bay for work. After this visit at Diana's guest house, I'm convinced that this experience was significantly better than any hotel I could stay in.	1
7276	4450	I typically stay in the same hotel each time I visit the East Bay for work. The house is so modern, spotless, and there was fruit, tea, chocolate and a bottle of wine waiting for me   The one aspect that I thought I wouldn't adjust to was not having a television. However, this ended up being something I loved.	1
7282	4454	We loved the modern design and really cool efficient use of space and the tranquil garden setting. I just wish we were there when it was warmer and sunny so we could sit in the garden outside. Bennie Dudgeon was super quick in his communication and was there to greet us when we arrived.	1
7285	4456	Oh, and the bed was really comfortable - meant for sleeping in. We were up visiting our son at Cal and it was just a quick 10 min drive over. We can't wait for another time we can visit so we can stay here again!	1
7290	4459	Justin’s place is close to the one of the best restaurants in the world, as well as the “gourmet ghetto” of excellent and cheap food. The street was quiet, yet waking distance to amenities. A great getaway for me and my friend.	1
7293	4461	Christian and Jackie are lovely people who offer a warm welcome into their home. The littles extras such as coffee, homemade bread and jam and fruit was a lovely touch to making us feel comfortable in their home. We had the small bedroom off the kitchen area and the bed was so comfortable.	1
7299	4464	Great views of Oakland docks and a different position of San Francisco Bay including travelling under the Bay Bridge. You can catch any train into San Francisco. I would recommend anyone looking for a warm and friendly household must stay at Christain and Jackie’s.	1
7307	4469	I could go on longer, but I'll just say that I had the best experience and the best sleep. I came to visit my daughter to celebrate a special occassion. I was looking simply for a place to rest at the end of the day.	1

7309	4470	I was looking simply for a place to rest at the end of the day. What I found at the casita was a beautiful spot with a million dollar view. Every detail was thoughtfully presented...from an oh-so-comfortable bed to great art; from starting me off with fresh fruit and english muffins to a deck overlooking the bay area; from lovely towels to a very pretty living room and kitchen.	1
7321	4477	The casita is small but has everything you could want for a comfortable stay. ), to the deck with a hammock and stunning ( web site hidden by Airbnb) was all so appreciated. I could not get over the special little touches everywhere like plants, candles, and pictures.	1
7326	4481	Double that in heavy traffic, but we did not mind because we loved this casita so much! This truly feels like slice of paradise. We could not have been happier with the accommodations!	1
7327	4481	Double that in heavy traffic, but we did not mind because we loved this casita so much! This truly feels like slice of paradise. We could not have been happier with the adjustment !	1
7328	4482	This truly feels like slice of paradise. The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemons! The cottage was immaculate, very comfortable, and had everything we needed.	1
7330	4483	The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemon ! It felt very private, with plenty of sunlight from the skylights, even when the shades were drawn. Ben & Jacqueline have print-outs with a guide for your stay that is super helpful, especially their neighborhood recommendations!	1
7342	4491	I had a wonderful time at Christina's place. The description of the listing is very accurate, it really did feel like a retreat. I stayed 3 nights and would have loved to stay longer.	1
7347	4494	The space was so cute, she is very thoughtful and creative with the decorations and lots of attention to detail to make the space as comfortable as possible for guests. Loved the garden. Fresh duck eggs from the backyard ducks were amazing and so nice and generous of her to share!	1
7354	4498	Feels like a cozy home away from home We really loved staying at Justin's place - perfect for our needs. Incredibly-well located near to the University campus, gourmet ghetto with its great choice of eateries, and the Rose Garden and hill above.	1
7359	4501	A lovely part of Berkeley, with beautiful garden all around and the street is incredibly quiet so you can get a good night's rest. Highly recommended.	1
7360	4502	My wife and I recently spent two nights at Leslie's place in Berkeley, and enjoyed it a great deal. While the home is a bit hidden from the street, when we walked through the gate we were immediately taken with the sweet fragrances of the beautiful flowers and plants in the front yard. Although I wasn't sure from the home description, there are actually two small spaces to sit outside and enjoy the weather--on the front porch and on a bench in the front yard.	1

7365	4504	The home itself has lots of charm and is nicely decorated throughout. While the small TV is viewable only from the formal dining table, it worked fine for us when watching a bit of television in the evening. The kitchen is spacious and fully equipped with plenty of counter space and everything needed to prepare a few meals.	1
7369	4507	The bedroom with queen bed and bathroom/shower were all on the cozy side, but the two of us managed just fine. The home is located on a quiet residential street, and the location is fantastic for exploring Berkeley. While we found it too far to walk down to the waterfront, we were able to explore the whole downtown and university area on foot.	1
7378	4512	My husband and I were inspired by this space, with its simplicity and aesthetic. We will most definitely return if we are ever in the Bay Area again.	1
7381	4514	Dan and Linda’s small, secluded cottage was exactly what we needed to escape to at the end of a long, crazy wedding day! We loved the little bouquets beside the bed that matched our wedding florals - a lovely and thoughtful touch! Their hospitality really went above and beyond what was required or expected, and we felt like special guests in their beautiful home.	1
7385	4516	Apparently, Linda & Dan's place is popular with honeymooners and it is easy to see why. It is charming and feels like everything about the space has been done with thought and grace. I loved the cast iron tub in the bathroom, near the stand-alone shower, and the light from the discreetly placed windows.	1
7392	4520	It was myself, my husband and our 5 year old son. Michael & Capra’s airstream was such a unique experience. Our son absolutely loved it.	1
7394	4522	The trampoline was a huge hit. He even had the chance to have a quick play date with their daughter (free babysitting! Ha!).	1
7398	4525	So relaxing, and cozy! Such a sweet little place.	1
7401	4526	My husband and I were very impressed with Lia and Christopher Brown’s gracious hospitality and comfortable, clean apt.!! And, we LOVED their sweet pooch , Questa! She couldn’t be more friendly and polite!	1
7407	4530	Too bad there isn't a 6 stars rating because our stay was just that great! George & Colleen's place was super comfortable, sparkling clean, stylishly decorated and spacious for our family of 3. There is a cute backyard and our preschool son loved roasting marshmallows in the fire pit!	1
7414	4534	We booked 1 week and had no issues, communication was excellent (George is very friendly and cheerful. Oakland - Myself and my boyfriend absolutely loved our stay here in Oakland, we didn't want to leave. Very spacious, peaceful and quiet.	1
7428	4541	Scott is a great host who has gone above and beyond to create a great experience for his guests. From step by step guides to local grocery stores and eateries to towel warmers and LED light Scott has thought of every detail that will provide a wonderful experience for his guests. Having stayed just short of three weeks, I most appreciated the gourmet kitchen as I could cook some meals, the patio to enjoy some fresh air, and the fact that the beach was within walking distance of his home.	1
7433	4544	He has a beautiful home that is everything pictured and more. For those with cars, street parking is easily available.	1
7440	4548	Finally regarding the location you cant beat it. Overall great value for the cost and beautiful topographic point . If I’m ever in LA again and not staying with my in-laws I would definitely stay at his place again.	1
7441	4549	Finally regarding the location you cant beat it. We had a fantastic stay at Scott’s house. The room was impeccably clean and comfortable, and we were impressed by Scott’s thoughtful attention to detail, including a towel warmer, welcome snacks, in-room coffee maker, and every toiletry you could think of in the bathroom!	1
7448	4554	The actual place is so cute and clean, and decorated in a beach theme. There are bicycles, a beach wagon, beach chairs, beach umbrellas in the shed outside. I cannot say enough about this place.	1
7450	4555	There are bicycles, a beach wagon, beach chair , beach umbrellas in the shed outside. You will love it!! !	1
7455	4559	Tiana was an amazing host. She was so prompt to response to our text messages and was such a sweetheart— so willing to go above and beyond to make us comfortable & or experience worth the stay. The cottage house was THEE MOST CUTEST, most COMFORTABLE, and ADORABLE thing EVER.	1
7464	4564	This is one of the best properties we've stayed in for a few reasons: great location, value, quality of space and amenities provided. This all made our stay exceptionally easy and Tiana was wonderful to work with! Awesome property!	1
7465	4565	This all made our stay exceptionally easy and Tiana was wonderful to work with! Tiana's Beach Cottage is a prime example of why people are choosing Air B&B over traditional hotels. The location is unbeatable for Southern California; in the middle of everything you'll want to go see, but off the beaten path where you can really just take in the Beach sights and smells to ease your stress away.	1
7467	4566	Tiana's Beach Cottage is a prime example of why people are choosing Air B&B over traditional hotels. The access to and from the space is great, with private off-road parking and a  dedicated entry-way for guests. Compared to a $25 a night packed parking lot or tipped Valet where you'll still need to walk a good distance and then take an elevator to get to your room, the convenience of this can't be overstated for travelers.	1
7472	4570	Tiana has a great team that takes care of the space, is nearby if you need assistance, and will provide everything you could ever need. And the shower pressure is fantastic! The living structure they've created for travelers is very special, but the location is really what makes this place a gem.	1
7482	4578	It is perfectly clean, comfortable, and walking distance to the beach. Tiana herself was also incredible. She was very welcoming, accommodating, and patient throughout our entire stay.	1
7494	4585	We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. The extra amenities (beach wagon, boogie boards, sand toys, beach chairs, etc.) helped our beach excursions go off without a hitch.	1
7496	4586	We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. The cottage is bright and cheery, and quite well-appointed, and the bedding is super comfortable! We were surprised by the high-quality air mattresses that allowed all of us to get a great night's sleep.	1
7504	4592	She also had a lot of recommendations for dining and activities to do around the city. Thank you Angela for such an awesome stay in LA.	1
7505	4592	She also had a lot of recommendation for dining and activities to do around the city. Thank you Michael Krieg for such an awesome stay in LA.	1
7509	4594	In my three years of experience with Airbnb, staying at Angela’s topographic point is bar none the best experience I’ve ever had with an Airbnb listing. I now clearly know the reason why she has the ratings that she does, and why her place is booked so far out in advance. Every element, from the spa-like goodies to soy candles, was tastefully curated by function and design.	1
7513	4597	It was perfect for reading, reflecting, and journaling. This was truly an impeccable experience and Angela was so warm and gracious. At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it.	1
7518	4599	At the mention of my little fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. I’m fairly certain that Angela is part angel. We arrived late on a Sunday night, about an hour later than planned due to a delayed flight.	1
7519	4600	At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. We were just married and are taking our honeymoon in a few months, so we stopped here for a “mini-moon”. Angela had ready for us a cheese plate, some sparkling wine, and chocolates!	1
7525	4603	The cabin is small, but Angela has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay. Couldn’t have asked for a better Airbnb or a kinder host. Thanks again, Angela!	1
7532	4607	The living room/bedroom has all the necessary comforts, with a sofa and ample room for clothing and other travel goods. We made good use of the stove and other kitchen amenities. The bathroom is clean and bright with a strong, rejuvenating shower.	1
7553	4620	She accommodated our arrival and departure time cuz we came early and left late. My first time using air b&b and i am completely satisfied	1
7566	4628	I knew it was going to be a great home from the sterling reviews, but I was still surprised to find this stylish space that is equipped with every little essentials left there by a very thoughtful host. Paul greeted us with a warm welcome and he made sure we had absolutely everything we needed. The space is furnished and decorated beautifully.	1
7574	4632	He offered us an umbrella as well, but we had brought ours. Bennie Dudgeon were also left there for us, but we couldn't utilize them in the end. After a long day at the beach, we were able to wash away our day in the oversized  shower (loved the shower so much!)	1
7582	4637	Walking on the beach in the morning and watching surfers out on the water was a real treat!! We were on the fence about staying this far from business district San Francisco, but we're so glad we did. Transportation into the heart of the city is just a short train ride away, and even if you stick around the area, there is so much to explore.	1
7588	4641	I asked for several recommendations and he had a variety of options for anything I asked. He went above & beyond when I asked for wine country recommendations and gave me a whole layout of the area, and a list to follow for the day. He truly puts so much thought and care into his home.	1
7592	4644	Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. He has thought of EVERY detail...hair dryer, bath robe , coffee, phone chargers, white noise, a mini fridge, and snacks (other little things too , but those at the things that were really a “wow” factor for me!). He was also so generous and let us check in early after a flight that arrived before check in time.	1
7593	4645	Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. I am so glad I found Tyler’s home! !	1
7600	4649	Thoughtful touches included a nicely designed welcome magazine orienting you to the house, facilities and neighbourhood, providing snacks, drinks, ear plugs, white noise speaker and Apple TV. He even replaced the beer in the fridge with Prosecco and Rosé after realising that we were drinking wine. The neighbourhood seems relatively safe and the cafe nearby is a great place to grab a meal and just chill.	1
7608	4654	This modern “open space concept” area is done exactly right, and just as open space fans intend — with gracious sitting, eating/work areas, that wonderful aquarium, and an astounding assortment of their collection of interesting libations on glass shelves. Your own room has two windows in  a 90 degree corner covering much of the same view, as well as an intimate glimpse into a typical SF backyard garden below (you are one story above the street, and on a steeply climbing hill, so you are looking out over the neighbors below on the hillside. General city noise with the window open for ventilation was modest, and there is a tiny electronic white sound device if you need it.	1
7612	4657	The closet is large and generous to hold your suitcases, as this delightful room is more “pocket size” than the usual overly large hotel room; it’s more like an updated luxury room in an early 1900’s fancy city hotel (Algonquin in NYC, Benson in Portland, or a Westin packaged into a compact structure). Our only cautions for others in selecting this property are commonplace for SF hilly neighborhoods:  (1) it does involve at least a dozen stairs for carrying your luggage so make sure you can do that; and (2) if you are coming via car instead of taxi/shared ride service, do expect to hunt for parking that could be a five minute (and possibly) steep walk away in the neighborhood of often narrow streets, as this is in the aptly named Bernal Heights  — but as we said, those two cautions exist in most hilly SF neighborhoods (we lived in nearby Francis Jones for 20 years). Otherwise, you will surely be delighted by the experience and by Tyler’s detailed and generous hospitality.	1
7615	4660	Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. Tyler has thought of everything a guest might want or need, providing a luxe, generous and comfortable place I.e phone charger ready for the guest, welcome snacks, a small fridge filled with local beer, big nice tv with Apple box to unwind at night, and good quality organic sf made lavender lotion and shampoos. There are so many beautiful places to see in SF and trust me, Tyler’s place will make your trip in SF even better !	1
7617	4661	Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. Tyler’s place was welcoming from the very beginning. Beautiful building to walk up to, stylish suite/home and setup, little welcome notes and interesting explanations scattered throughout our room and public spaces!	1
7624	4667	), coffee station, wine bottle donation option, sweet WiFi, bathroom soaps and toiletries, slippers and robes... to even just leaving the light on for us each night so we could be welcomed home properly!!! Just so much thought went into creating the amazing guest experience here. And the walkthroughs and notes were all so clever.	1
7631	4671	You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. We really lucked out. We appreciate Tyler for giving this fun and memorable experience :)  what a gorgeous home.	1
7632	4671	You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. We really lucked out. We appreciate Edward Ramsey for giving this fun and memorable experience :)  what a gorgeous home.	1
7634	4672	You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. Whoever coined the phrase, “location, location, location” must have had Brian Burns’s place in mind. Not only is it sparkling clean, this rental is stylishly appointed with a full sized stove, refrigerator, and oven which we found useful for heating up leftovers and making eggs in the morning.	1
7640	4675	We especially loved that it was only a couple of street away from Ocean Beach and the spectacular Sea Cliff bluff . We took regular walks along the coastline, and were happy to be able to come “home” in the evening to a place that was very comfortable and inviting. In all, we had an amazing time, and would highly recommend his place to others.	1
7641	4676	We took regular walks along the coastline, and were happy to be able to come “home” in the evening to a place that was very comfortable and inviting. Jeffrey and Mike are lovely hosts and the room we stayed in with a beautiful en suite bathroom was very comfortable, stylish and clean. The room is in a beautiful San Francisco Victorian in the back of the house.	1
7646	4679	There was great water pressure, and while we noticed the large spa tub, we didn't have time to use it (besides, we're Californians who worry about water use! ), but I'm sure it would be great! The location is fantastic !	1
7648	4681	), but I'm sure it would be great! It was stunningly pretty and very quiet and safe. Everything was within walking distance or an easy Uber ride away.	1
7652	4684	Pictures do not begin to show the beauty of this place. The private deck/ patio is nice but the swimming pool and hot tub are so awesome. The scenery around them is what makes it so relaxing.	1
7664	4692	The bed was very comfortable. Wish we could have stayed more than one night! Great hosts, sweet dogs, beautiful neighborhood, we look forward to visiting again and will recommend to our friends and family whenever they’re in the area.	1
7666	4693	The bed was very comfortable. Wonderful place!	1
7672	4696	The bungalow is a cozy environment with a completely stocked kitchen; comfortable furniture; quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance to food, entertainment AND beautiful walking trails and the beach is one road crossing away! The week my husband came to visit, Shantell Preusser spent time showing him around and the level of hospitality and true caring by both Shantell Preusser and Chris can NOT be beat. If you are looking for a romantic get-away or the perfect beach location for a break - I highly recommend the Ocean Park Cottage.	1
7674	4697	If you are looking for a romantic get-away or the perfect beach location for a break - I highly recommend the Ocean Park Cottage. My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Tim and Jodi Stallings were SO helpful with offering suggestions on what we could do and see while we were in town. The cottage was super cunning and comfortable, and SO close to the beach.	1
7678	4699	My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Lois Davis and Alejandrina Anderson were SO helpful with offering suggestions on what we could do and see while we were in town. We went hiking at First Landing State Park, went and saw the two old lighthouses close by (and also the site of the first landing), walked for miles along the beach, and ate at a few really good restaurants. We definitely want to come back - the town was charming and laid back.	1
7679	4700	We went hiking at First Landing State Park, went and saw the two old lighthouses close by (and also the site of the first landing), walked for miles along the beach, and ate at a few really good restaurants. Thanks to Chris and Tim for making the trip even better!	1
7694	4710	My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Chris and Tim's cottage. Just being inside and examining the decor was entertaining in of itself. My husband and I travel a lot and I can say conclusively this was the most adorable place we have ever stayed in.	1
7705	4716	We hit it off right away and even talked in kitchen for a while before I unloaded my car and got a tour of the house! Melissa have a Big heart and really loves others around her! She even took the time to write out a lengthy recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant spots were out of this world!	1
7710	4718	She even took the time to write out a lengthy recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant spots were out of this universe ! :) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweetest of spirits! It was a short trip but Visited the Beach, Boardwalk and The Navy seal monument which was pretty profound!	1
7711	4719	:) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweetest of spirits! I would highly recommend it if you have an opportunity located on 38th street and the boardwalk. Hope to visit here again and thanks again Melissa, you Rock!	1
7722	4725	The great thing, these were all within biking / walking distance of Star and Austin’s place. Just book it now! You won’t be disappointed!	1
7726	4727	I'll add mine to the list! The location is ideal. Her place is tucked away on a quiet street that backs to a golf course.	1
7727	4728	The location is ideal. You can't believe you are within walking distance to the boardwalk. It is  close to everything.	1
7729	4729	The location is ideal. You can walk to a Harris Teter. Dennis Steward could need is within walking distance or a bike ride.	1
7735	4732	With dedicated bike lanes, it is easy and fun. She put a lot of thought into finding quality eateries.. everything from coffee shops and greasy spoon , to seafood and Mexican. Added bonus.. almost every place is within walking distance.	1
7737	4734	She put a lot of thought into finding quality eateries.. everything from coffee shops and greasy spoons, to seafood and Mexican. You will sleep well. The kitchenette is adorable.. and I loved the window seat, which was a perfect reading nook.	1
7741	4737	Man, it’s really hard to explain the amount of comfort, appreciation and hospitality that Brent provided. Brent went above and beyond for me and my fiancé one of the most genuine and beautiful human beings I’ve met and it was an everlasting memory staying at his home that I will not forget. Brent should be a role model for all other hosts.	1
7751	4745	For the past 20 years we have camped at First Landing State Park, of which our favorite facet is the Cape Henry bike trail which spans from 64th street, through first Landing all the way to Jade st.  Katherine’s place is about 200 feet from this trail so we were smack dab in the middle of all of our favorite things. The space was quiet, secluded and inviting. The bed and linens were over the top comfy and the bathroom and Kitchenette was stylish and updated.	1
7755	4747	We were surprised by the amenities offered such as teas, coffee, luxury toiletries, local guides and even a bidet! Beach living in a quiet, inviting setting.	1
7767	4755	Chuck is available and close by, yet you feel like you have the house alone. I loved relaxing in the hot bathtub , robes provided, the chefs kitchen and cool lighting. I think our stay will be a sweet memory, not just lodging on a trip.	1
7769	4757	I think our stay will be a sweet memory, not just lodging on a trip. So that explains it! I had never done this before, and was a little concerned that it might be awkward.	1
7773	4759	Chuck is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive. And the home and grounds are spacious enough that we were never in each other's way. He works quietly in his office most of the time, but is readily available for a chat, advice, or a recommendation for food or something to do.	1
7775	4760	Chuck is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive. The house is extremely close to the airport - which is convenient, but I wondered if the noise would be problematic (I'm a light sleeper and pretty sensitive to noise) - nope, you can hear the occasional plane but it isn't bothersome at all, and we slept very well. Being a fan of mid-century modern art, design, and architecture, I thoroughly enjoyed the home and all the interesting furnishings Chuck has curated.	1
7779	4762	Well today is the last day of my 28 day stay at Wiseacre. I came here to Norfolk Virginia to hang out with my 4 grandchildren ages 13, 10, 6, and 5. I also worked as usual on during the days since they are in school all day long.	1
7780	4763	"I came here to Norfolk Virginia to hang out with my 4 grandchildren ages 13, 10, 6, and 5. If you need to stay in Norfolk for any amount of time, I can say to you, ""Look no further than Wiseacre!"". Here are just a few reasons why..."	1

7784	4765	The grounds are spectacular and vast with something to peek your interest at every turn. The home itself is so incredibly spectacular with the intent of Frank Lloyd Wrights' unique architecture of bringing the outside into the home. Morning sunrise and evening sundown are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area.	1
7787	4766	Morning sunrise and evening sunset are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area. The view spans past the wonderfully creativity of the land into the clear gorgeous Whitehurst Lake with birds bathing all day long and paddle fisherman enjoying their mornings on the weekends. Kayaking is also something to consider if you have time!	1
7791	4768	Morning sunrise and evening sunset are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area. Gorgeous views! And, just as important to note - the friendliness of Erik Dickson is real!	1
7800	4773	We had the pleasure of staying at Wiseacre for a few days to enjoy some peaceful family time. Wiseacre is a beautiful, Frank Lloyd Wright inspired house filled with an eclectic array of art, history and personal touches. Chuck and Charlotte (the sweetest pup) were the best hosts.	1
7808	4777	We used the full, modern kitchen to cook several meals--we had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay! We even spent some time fishing on Lake Whitehurst which is located on the property. This was our first Airbnb experience and we think that Jodi Stallings, Charlotte, and Wiseacre have set the bar so very high!	1
7818	4783	My favorite activity was looking out the large floor-to-vaulted-ceiling windows watching the weather and lake activity. Lastly, Charlotte was a little love to have around! Quiet, affectionate and the best of pups.	1

7833	4791	Brian Burns's sense of humor is delightful and we truly loved our chats with him throughout our stay. Brian Burns’s beautiful home and landscape is only matched by his own wonderful personality, we decided that we will be staying here from here on out whenever we visit Norfolk so long as the space is available when we do visit. Most everything you can imagine is within a 15 minute drive with some great options for lunch/dinner at an even shorter distance.	1
7836	4793	Most everything you can imagine is within a 15 minute drive with some great options for lunch/dinner at an even shorter distance. The entire house is covered head to toe with a specific taste in art, it’s engaging. I just wish we had the time to ask about all the pieces.	1
7850	4802	Electronics kits? Old powered Microscopes?) WHAT FUN!	1
7854	4804	What nostalgia on the games! The place was safe and secure, I didn't feel threatened on the streets or neighborhood. The driveway is a tiny bit cramped if you drive a behemoth, so be careful but the how-to guide explains this too ;-)  If you want to learn more, just stay!	1
7856	4805	The place was safe and secure, I didn't feel threatened on the streets or neighborhood. We had a great time staying in Dash Point at Tony and Attina's place. It was our first time in Tacoma.	1
7858	4806	It was our first time in Tacoma. The view is what drew me to their place and when sun made an appearance sitting out on the deck and taking in the view was awesome. They have put much thought into their place and it showed.	1
7863	4809	They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. Each June I travel from California to Tacoma to oversee a program at the University of Puget Sound. My stay is for three weeks.	1
7874	4815	For this trip, I was lucky to be able to book my husband and his brother in at my fave place in Tacoma. My husband is a man of few words...and fewer superlatives. But below is all him:  Our stay at Susan’s place was fantastic.	1

7878	4817	Not only was the space immaculate, she had left us a wonderful variety of fruits, baked goods, beverages and even small samples of local ice cream. There were also a variety of tour guides and local magazines to help us find good restaurants and attractions. Susan had also prepared her own short review of some of the local restaurants which was extremely helpful.	1
7891	4824	They have it! And they have coasters! My friends and I seriously wanted to buy their loft it’s so beautiful.	1
7897	4827	I love the crude artsy vibe a ton. We drew, played guitar, watched shows, played pool, did our makeup in the mirror, took pictures, made coffee and tea, played games, listened to vinyls, etc we took advantage of all the place had to offer us! Crystal Romero and Shantell Preusser are so kind too!	1

I had a slumber party here with my friends for my birthday last week.	1

7906	4832	Zeena and her husband, Howie, have a beautiful home and were very gracious hosts. We communicated this via the message board and Zeena had no problem with the late check-in. Her directions to the house were very clear and it was easy to find in the dark.	1
7912	4836	They don't have air conditioning, but the room temperature in the middle of summer was more than tolerable with the ceiling fan and open window. We had a great night's sleep and was impressed with the high quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the bathtub. For breakfast, Zeena laid out a wonderful meal complete with eggs, cinnamon toast, fresh fruit and coffee.	1
7913	4837	We had a great night's sleep and was impressed with the high quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the bathtub. Zeena checked in with us regularly and always asked if we needed anything else, definitely going above and beyond. Even though our stay was short, my new wife and I were extremely satisfied and delighted with our stay at Zeena and Howie's home!	1
7922	4842	Loved the views, truly beautiful from every room and either deck. Richard Batton and Erik Dickson were extremely accommodating and wonderful to work with. Great selection of games to play.	1
7925	4844	Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. This home will not disappoint. Kitchen has a double oven as well as a microwave and a nice BBQ on the deck.	1
7926	4845	Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. Towels were super soft and big. All the beds were very comfortable and the Xtra air mattress was top notch.	1
7928	4847	Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. If you are not familiar with the area they have put together a great information manual to help out. The local grocery store down the road is great, good selection even though it is smaller than the large chains.	1
7933	4851	Our daughter and her boyfriend came up from LA to join us. The three sleeping areas each had very comfortable beds, good pillows, and plenty of blankets of varying weights. Each bathroom was large with large, fluffy towels, shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash.	1
7939	4854	The kitchen is nicely appointed, there are plenty of game and movies available, and there is even a great outdoor living space! I love waking up to the water and mountain views! Although I have heard rumors that it always rains in Seattle, we had perfect weather this past week.	1
7941	4855	I love waking up to the water and mountain position ! Thanks, Richard Batton and Miranda Malone; your house was pretty much perfect!	1
7943	4856	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Pamela Drew loft is gorgeous and very spacious. Filled with art & comfy furniture.	1
7953	4862	Very friendly folks. We also hit a new spot called Wooden City on Pacific (GOOD FOOD & friendly service) and HONEY COFFEE at Alma Mater for breakfast (they had super yum meat, veg & vegan options + pastries and really good coffee). Eating in Tacoma is good these days.	1
