We really enjoyed the kitchenette, which was stocked with plastic silverware, coffee, tea, sugar, and had a coffee maker and electric kettle. Katherine also provided beach towels. I appreciated the special care Katherine took to ensure our comfortable stay.
;) Alejandrina Anderson and Cher Alexander were absolutely antic hosts! They greeted us at the door with smiles and helped us bring our luggage in.
We loved our stay at Rayford Kelly's place and would highly recommend this rental. Her topographic point was so clean & immaculate. We also have our own parking topographic point on their drive way which is so convenient for us.
Best of all was the attention to detail. The only regret that we have is not being able to stay more days at her lovely home. Hopefully we can do that again in the future.
We drove to the places we needed to go so I am not certain if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops. So if you need privacy in the bathroom you have to ask your traveling companion to leave the bedroom. And like the description says there are a couple of steep stair cases.
We loved the snacks that she provided as well as the convince of the honor bar that was fully stocked! We can’t wait to go back! This stay was amazing!
Slept amazing and very close to local attractions such as the Redondo Beach Pier, local restaurants and cute little boutique shops. this is the best Airbnb experience for me so far, everything far exceed the expectation and the value is incomparable among similar place. you basically spend economy price for a presidential suite.
Igor and May are such wonderful hosts! It was great coming back from the hot sun to relax and sleep!!! There is free parking on the streets and the area felt very safe.
it's there!)! Thanks Elizabeth Jones An! !
Gloria is also very responsive and makes sure you have everything you need which is so nice. At the end of a long day, grabbing a drink at one of the endless options of restaurants and bars in the area, relaxing in the huge jetted tub and then curling up in the sleep number bed is exactly what I needed. I would stay at this place again in a heartbeat and if you're staying in town, I absolutely recommend you do too!
This was a really wonderful spot. Jo was a fabulous host. Access to the house via her garage was offered, though street parking is also very easy.
Jo made every accommodation we had asked for and then some. She was responsive to initial inquiries about the space and replied within a short time to all communication. We are unsure of Tacoma.
My husband is a man of few words...and fewer superlatives. She could not have been a more welcoming host. Not only was the space immaculate, she had left us a wonderful variety of fruits, baked goods, beverages and even small samples of local ice cream.
The host was quick to respond to our questions. Highly recommended to all.
We stayed in her cottage for 6 days in late-December. We selected Heather’s cottage because it was located just a block my son and his family. Heather was the perfect host, and she provided us everything we needed to stay comfortable, dry (thank you for the extra umbrellas!
Learned that the property was built in 1913 including the in law suite. We had an amazing stay and would highly recommend.
Chuck is a consummate host, who sincerely cares about his guests. The house has so many great features that you just have to visit to find out what its all about. We chose his place because it was so close to the Norfolk Botanical Garden, which I highly recommend.
We had a great stay at Tyler's place! The bed is very comfy and we really appreciated the charging stations on either side. The communal space upstairs is gorgeous!
With luxurious touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. The space is centrally located, a close distance to great attractions in Oakland and in Berkeley. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our week in Oakland, CA!
Whether it's for business or pleasure, Maggie's place is PERFECT. Maggie & John are so wonderful and accommodating! If you’re looking for a safe, convenient, quiet, and clean place to stay for your NYC visit, look no further!
I have now experienced first hand why Angela and her incredible AirBNB home has over 200 five-star reveiws! INCREDIBLE. PERFECT.
We felt extremely comfortable, the room is modern and chic, everything you could wish for, even Crystal Romero...perfect down to the very last detail. We'd love to come back!
What a lovely experience at George and Colleen's place! When I arrived, there were delicious blueberry muffins and snacks waiting! The muffins came in a close second to the beautiful surroundings - we could only see sky and trees from the backyard and heard only birds.
The house was very easy to locate and is situated on a quiet residential street with restaurants, coffee shops, and public transit just a few block away. Also- I cannot overstate how wonderful it was to have a parking spot! Overall, the space exceeded my expectations with many thoughtful details throughout that make it inviting and comfortable.
I met Michael Krieg in the morning and he was a charming, lovely person..I really appreciated him making us so welcome. We drove a few minutes, parked near the station, and caught a train that got us to the heart of the city in 30 minutes. I heartily recommend staying here, only wish we had for more than one night!
Would definitely stay here again. Elizabeth is an incredibly warm, friendly, genuinely beautiful human. She's a joy to know.
The location is ideal. Speakingof bikes, they are a great amenity. I'm not a big cyclist, but I took Christine's suggestion and biked along the  boardwalk.
Scott was so welcoming and responsive, and very thoughtful about making sure that we had everything we needed. A perfect launchpad for exploring Chicago, or for taking some time to rest and relax.
When we walked back we were greeted by the delicious smell of different flowers growing overhead and around the yard. We had a great stay and with the beach so close we rode there every day with the beach cruisers Angela provided. There is so much to do in that area of the beach and the great bike paths made it all easy to get to.
Chuck was really good at answering our questions and giving us advice of places near by. Chuck being in the house was the only concern, but it didn't even feel like he was in the house with us. The location is also perfect, 2 minutes away from stores like Food Lion, 3-5 minutes away from East Beach, 15-20 mins away from the center of VA Beach, and if you really want to go in the lake, the first bit of the lake is shallow and will only reach your knees.
The whole bottom floor of Laura and Ralph’s house and their large garden was ample space for us, and was private. The amenities are of a great quality and we had everything we needed. There were many thoughtful touches from our hosts as well such as a baby bath, toys, home-made banana bread and tourist info.
Highly recommend! This little studio is beautifully decorated, very clean, many thoughtful touches, at a professional degree  B and bacillus ! The picture doesn’t do it justice!
Clean, cozy, private, amenities, bicycles, coffee machine, microwave and a small fridge in the room. Location is excellent! Marc and Tammy and the most wonderful hosts!
Loved staying at Nevas and will definitely be back. The guesthouse was Super safe and quiet. Bed was so comfortable , I slept great!
Thank you Jerry and Thomas George for being such amazing hosts! I can't say adequate good things about this place. The views are AMAZING, the neighborhood is great, and the hosts were very attentive.
Went above and beyond and helped me get a great sleep after a long day of hiking and travel. Would recommend to anyone
This is a wonderfully convenient, artsy and comfortable place to stay. Spotless, well appointed, really great bed, and amazing art work everywhere! Christopher Brown is immediately responsive and provides a lovely and thorough welcome.
Set in a great little area - easy to get down to the bay and some really great local food place (we particularly enjoyed Kelly’s sushi tip!) Our favourite Air B and B to date!
The house was very homey, clean and comfortable. Esme was super friendly and helpful with information about the area. She laid out a wonderful spread of breakfast goodies each morning, which was so nice.
The location is ideal. You can walk to a Harris Teter. Everythingyou could need is within walking distance or a bike ride.
Talk about finding a great house for a family gathering! Wow.... we loved this place! My husband and I traveled to the area to visit our son who is on assignment in Tacoma.
The place is decorated super cute and trendy. We recommend this place to anyone that wants a secluded getaway, and to be right at the beach. Can't say enough about this super clean, hip apartment.
This small apartment has everything you may need and more!! Like no joke, that was my favorite part!!! To come to her apartment after a long day walking around the city to her bed was the best!
The location was convenient to exploring some really cool shops, parallel bars , and restaurant nearby. My sister and I absolutely loved staying at Heather and JP's place. This was our first time booking an Airbnb and the bar is set really high for any future bookings anywhere else.
We were able to check in and out quickly. We loved that we could control the AC since I get cold very easily and the area was very quiet. Ewa always responded quickly and was very helpful in providing transportation options.
The room itself is so spacious and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. One of the most surprising and delightful things about her topographical point is that nothing in the kitchen is off-limits. It’s truly like you’re staying at a friend’s house.
Very stylish, tidy, and roomy. There was no need to drive at all! Shantell Preusser was very responsive and very quick to answer my questions.
The room is clean and big and the shower has the best water pressure I’ve ever felt! We wanted to have a picnic one day and Jeff provided us with a cooler to use. Nothing was too much trouble for him.
Paul's topographical point offered  even more than we expected. The bonus was Paul's warm cordial reception and friendly personality. He went out of his way to check in with us to make sure we were enjoying our stay and had everything we needed.
Arthur Paddick is an incredibly warm, friendly, genuinely beautiful human. And her house also happens to be comfortable and well positioned in Long Beach. If you're looking for a comfortable stay with an interesting and friendly host, look no further.
We loved this location and neighborhood. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions.
Their place is truly a respite. The bedrooms with bath in-between was ideal. Sunset over Lake Whitehurst was simply breathtaking.
She is very friendly with a warm personality and responsive to any questions we may have had. Angela gave us great suggestions about where to go for a number of things, including yoga for my husband. Her bungalow is one of the best we have stayed in.
We just like to have the news on as we wake up and fall asleep. Those two things couldn’t overshadow the magic of the cottage or how wonderful our hosts were!
He showed me the flat and gave recommendations when I arrived. The room is comfortable and the flat is located in the middle of Downtown Chicago, which makes is a good base to explore the city. The highlight, though, is the deck with the wonderful flower pots!
Paul also provided some bite and beverages for out stay. Paul's topographic point was excellent; very stylish and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable.
I got to fall in love w Oakland. Amy & Dennis’s cabin exceeded my expectations. Communication was timely and thoughtful, and it was very easy to check in and check out.
All in all great stay and would definitely come back to Tammy in the future! Jennifer Merry, beach chairs and towels are also available. Tammy was wonderful and met me on arrival and helped me with parking and my things.
I highly recommend staying here for a trip to California. We would love to stay here again for our next trip to California!
This airbnb was one of the best I've stayed in so far. Great value, exceptionally clean, comfortable and cozy, with everything we needed for a short getaway. The place was exactly as described and shown.
Berkeley is such a cool pocket of NorCal, this place is PERFECT for exploring and enjoying all the city has to offer. (*The bed is ridiculously comfortable!) (** The location really isn’t all that hilly — especially when taking into account how hilly the Bay Area is in general.
You can go to the Golden State Park walking. Everything is as described on the webpage. All the direction manual are there and well explained.
It's a very quick down to the beach and even if you forgot your beach stuff he's got you covered with everything you need to have a fun beach adventure. There's a great Italian restaurant around the corner from him if you want some grub and then come back and relax in the nicely decorated place. We look forward to the next opportunity we have to stay with Paul
Thanks again. Access to the kitchen and the Keurig coffee in the morning made it perfect. Very close to Beach and all of Redondo Beach restaurants.
Jennifer Merry was so nice, we felt like we knew him for old age . Jennifer Merry’s topographic point is exactly as described. When we got there, the place was spotless.
Room was small but excellent! Quiet neighborhood! Perfect for me, my husband and our 11 calendar month old daughter.
Neighborhood was quiet. My favorite part of my stay is that Neva had small amenities (q-tips, cetaphil face wash, sunblock, aloe vera, coffee, notepad and pen). Stuff you might need but never think of.
What a lovely experience at Brian Burns and Colleen's place! When I arrived, there were delightful blueberry muffins and snacks waiting! The muffins came in a close second to the beautiful surroundings - we could only see sky and trees from the backyard and heard only birds.
Michael is fantastic. He was welcoming, warm, and generous when we stayed with him this past Friday. We loved our cozy room, the art and decor was so unique, the location was perfect, and the rooftop patio was a great bonus.
Tyler has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience. You will not be disappointed or feel misled if you stay with Tyler. It really is as good as it looks!
what a great location, and cozy great room! everything was perfect.... location is great, you can go to the beach in just a few minutes! Dennis Steward provide's a clean and tidy place that feels like home!
What nostalgia on the games! The place was safe and secure, I didn't feel threatened on the streets or neighborhood. The driveway is a tiny spot cramped if you drive a behemoth, so be careful but the how-to guide explains this too ;-)  If you want to learn more, just stay!
The room itself is bigger than I expected, which was nice as my husband ended up needing to do some work. The bathroom is extra spacious with two sinks and a big, walk in shower. I enjoyed having an outdoor balcony to sit and enjoy a morning cup of coffee.
We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds. The amenities provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush? razor?
Though I never met Joseph Lewis in person, he was quick and clear with communication. A block away from Dolores Park! About 10 min walk to the 16th St BART, which is convenient if traveling to and from airport.
This is a return trip for us and we were unaware of some of the new kings in the area. We had a wonderful stay here for the two of us during a road trip through the southwest of the USA. Paul welcomed us unobtrusively but personally and gave us helpful tips for the place itself and beyond for our further journey.
Elizabeth's place is fantastic. The room is huge, with a very large comfortable bed and great comforts . Everything was great and we were sad to leave.
Thoughtful. A value. Family friendly and business travel friendly.
I loved the topographic point , it was very bright clean as well as the shared bathroom. We barely met other guest of the house but when we did they were very nice as well as Elizabeth- she was very helpful and cared about our comfortness and about anything we had needed.
A perfect place for a couple people for a pickup . I so enjoyed my stay at Paul’s guesthouse. I was in town for a wedding and wanted to stay close to the beach.
Everywhere one turns there is something else to discover - many pieces provide a chuckle, as does Chuck himself (and his adorable Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Charlotte). Chuck's sense of humor is delightful and we truly loved our chats with him throughout our stay. We hope to visit again sometime and take in the beauty and whimsy of Wiseacre!
I have used many enjoyable Airbnb’s while traveling, but Elizabeth Jones home has really raised the bar (my expectations will be way too high now!!). Traveling to a new city for a vacation, you want to find the best of everything so you enjoy your time...well...Crystal Romero made our whole vacation so enjoyable!! I asked for several recommendations and he had a variety of options for anything I asked.
It was clean, spacious and was safe for a single person's stay. It's in a great location so close to the beach and  it definitely would work well for a small family on vacation, as well. I was there late and only had a short interaction face to face with James Walker but she was courteous, gracious and kind - she knocked on my door to alert me that my car was parked in a place that could get a ticket.
The cabin was an excellent place for us to stop for a night before flying home after a holiday visit to the Northwest. It was tucked away in a residential neighborhood, but easy to transition back to the interstate. We loved all the special touches that Jeneva had added to the cabin.
You have a separate private entrance, full bathroom, room, living room, and a covered outdoor area. There are plates, cups, and plastic ware, which is a nice touch. I throughly enjoyed the shower!
Located in a beautiful neighborhood with quick  access to all of Tacoma's many, many attractions, this apartment is simply a fantastic, well-appointed, relaxing  getaway! !
Roberta Hallenbeck and Raquel Eastham's cottage was the perfect place to stay when we were in Oakland for a wedding. The Temescal and Rockridge areas were really fun to explore, and there were great restaurants right around the corner from their house. Street parking was easy over the weekend and it's only a 5 minute walk from the BART.
Angela was a fantastic host! She was incredibly nice, very responsive, and made sure that I had everything I needed (and then some). Her home was adorable, and the backyard is the cutest.
It is a hidden gem! Thank you so much for making our stay so wonderful! ~Lynne and Patrick
So kind. If you get nice weather, don’t forget to check out Dolores Park for some insane people watching...also a close walk or bus ride. The space itself is warm and inviting with an excellent back porch.
We loved our cozy room, the art and decor was so unique, the location was perfect, and the rooftop patio was a great bonus. We would love to stay here again someday!
There were lots of nice touches and this had more of a bed and breakfast vibe to it. This place is absolutely amazing! I loved that each room had its very own name/style and that their "Cozy Room" definitely lived up to my expectations.
We will definitely be back. She has everything you need for a day at the beach , or a day out on the bikes. Will be staying there again on our following visit.
The flower vines were in bloom, the view walking up onto the deck and the details of decor even on the outside let us know this place was special! It is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, cozy and the linens are top notch. Arthur Paddick and Attina were there as needed, friendly when we saw them and eager to make our stay fantastic, even giving us a late check out which was very much appreciated.
I really can't find a single thing to list here that I didn't like. Everything you could possibly want on a trip away from home was provided here. She also had a swimming pool and hot tub available should you want to relax in that fashion.
A most remarkable aspect of our stay was the surprisingly numerous item that are available for use, from makeup mirror to the fantastic 3-speed cruiser bicycles, that made our stay so much easier and more pleasant. Omg! I cannot talk highly enough of the place and the hosts!
She was extremely friendly and gave us a tour to make sure we knew where everything was, including many extra pillows, blankets, and towels. She and her husband live on the property and were available in case we needed anything, but the home was so well-stocked we didn't have any problems! The hot tub and pool were especially relaxing, and we loved hanging out with their extremely friendly dogs.
The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our life area truly made our trip perfect. A very unique concept for an Airbnb and we loved it. The idea of a living space within a home completely secluded from the chief housing is something that catches the eye and this place does not fail to impress.
Additionally the neighborhood is also extremely close to an assortment of restaurants and other entertainment outside of just the beach. I would highly recommend Rayford Kelly space for anyone looking for a topographical point to stay in VA beach!
The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra warmth. And the breakfast room and attached balcony are sunny, with Traci's homemade muffins, quiche, eggs, fruit.
This is the best Airbnb place we have stayed at and we’ve stayed at a few. This is a gorgeous place in a beautiful garden. It was spotlessly clean with plenty of towels provided as well as information about the local area, printer & PC, washing machine and dryer, large fridge and freezer and a well equipped kitchen.
I can’t say enough good things here! Old Town is a great little spot in Tacoma with lots to do, and easy access to l-5. Coffee shops, restaurants and an excellent walking path along the bay just blocks away.
This is a lovely, placid , very clean room in a quiet neighborhood of Berkeley. For me, it was within walking distance of the Downtown Berkeley BART and the north side of the UC Berkeley campus. You do have to walk uphill a bit to get to the place, so keep that in mind if you have luggage other than a backpack.
Neighborhood was quiet. Easy check-in too! !
Her home was always tidy and quiet. What you read is what you get... and more!! Betty Maust made it feel like my own home.
Jeni’s condo was a true oasis! Jeni’s place was exactly that - a home away from home. Everything that we had been missing about home (some space to move around, a real kitchen, an amazing bathtub) was found at this terrific Airbnb.
I had no problem sleeping. There is a small fridge, microwave, and Coffee maker. Plenty for a visit.
My boyfriend and I needed a “down/relaxing” weekend. This is away from the “hustle and bustle” of Virginia Beach, yet close enough to get to easily to enjoy. Star and John Brashier have bikes, beach towels, beach chairs, a cooler, etc...everything you need to enjoy a get away to Virginia Beach.
On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great.
We only stayed a couple days, but the house is set up for even a 2 week-long restful stay. I hope we can come back soon! Literally nothing bad to say.
We absolutely loved staying at Sierra's place! My two friends and I were attending Kamala Harris' campaign launch rally in Oakland and this was the perfect place to stay for the weekend. We arrived a bit earlier than expected and my phone failed to send the ETA message to Sierra but she let us drop our things off and freshen up which was deeply appreciated.
It was bright, clean, and beautiful. There are other places you can get to in an Uber or Lyft for under $10 which is awesome. We loved that they had breakfast items in the fridge for us - so sweet!
Pamela Drew’s condominium was a true oasis! We had been traveling at Mt. Rainer National Park and were ready to feel at home.
What a treat! Betty Maust bungalow is delightful. It is clean, cunning , and well appointed!
Her communication is so friendly and helpful that she really made our stay even more memorable. I don't think it was special treatment, I believe this is her standard mode of operation and it equates to high level customer service. The service we receive can either enhance or detract from a travelers experience, but Tiana's attentiveness made the entire package truly unbeatable.
It was so cleanly,  impeccably designed, welcoming, private, and warm-we lacked nothing and only 2 blocks from beach! This cottage was perfect. It was decorated just as a beach cottage should be, and it was so clean.
When I first got there, Dennis greeted and acquainted me with the place. My favorite parts are the loft bed (heads up you do need to climb a ladder) & outdoor shower. There's clean towels, a kitchenette (no stove), tea, coffee and even extra toiletries to use if you need.
The neighborhood is beautiful. It was clean, nicely decorated, and Paul did an awesome occupation of including anything you could possibly need in the space. Out of the week we spent hopping around California, this was my favorite bed.
Very great location near the beach and restaurants and also very clean and nice! This was the perfect space for a quick trip to California, & our only regret was that we wish we could have stayed longer! The place is adorable, very clean, great location, & the parking spaces were so nice to have (not always a given in the area).
He helped us get parking, gave us a tour, and got us all settled. I will be back!
We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. The excess amenities (beach wagon, boogie boards, sand toys, beach chairs, etc.) helped our beach excursions go off without a enlistment .
I would highly recommend staying at Nina's Place, you will not be disappointed. Nina and her husband were great hosts. The location is about a half hour from the beach and located in a quaint neighborhood.
We live in a very quiet neighborhood in Phoenix so the noise out on the street, definitely caused us to not have as restful of a night’s sleep as we had hoped. The morning commute traffic was also something we had to contend with after a late night out on the town. This is urban living and unless you’re use to it, we would highly suggest you bring ear plugs.
I have to mention the good quality of the bed;)! We stayed just one night but won't hesitate for the following time. We recommend...
! What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago.
Amazing, very cosy, very comfy beds, stylish apartment. Very hospitable. We felt very safe and well looked after.
My husband and I stayed here for two nights before I dropped him at SFO  The space is clean and roomy (for a studio), with high ceilings, a walk in closet, large bathroom, and comfortable seating area. We found the pace very comfortable for a couple and would stay again if it is available the next time we are in SF.
The alone suggestion we have would be for the upstairs neighbors to be a small quieter in the mornings. I would stay here again!
It was BEAUTIFUL and the bed was the MOST comfortable we have ever slept on. We were so pleased with everything else, we would forfeit those for what we did have. Keyless entry into the building and into the apartment.
We loved our time in Tony and Attina's tiny house. Everything was clean and ready for us. Any time I reached out, they responded immediately.
This was my boyfriend and I’s first Air Bnb experience and we loved it! This place was exactly as shown in the pictures! The check in was pretty simplistic (however try to avoid the neighbor with the angry dog).
You have a separate private entrance, full bathroom, room, living room, and a covered outdoor area. There is a door that separates your place and Mona’s half of the home. In the living room area, there is a mini fridge (not freezer) and microwave in addition to a coffee machine.
The trampoline was a huge hit. It rained the majority of our weekend, which made our nights even more special. I still can hear the raindrops on the outside of the airstream.
Alfred’s restaurant across the street was an easy option for breakfast. I almost didn't want to leave during my stay...just was so comfortable. They leave a detailed guide of local spots to check out along with estimated walking/driving times-- Alfred's Cafe across the street is a great spot for breakfast (get the Biscuits and gravy--chorizo gravy FTW).
We would never have had as nice a trip if we had stayed in a hotel. Our trip was only one night, but the location was perfect, everything was thought out, and we really felt that we were able to get away from it all. I highly recommend a stay here!
The bungalow was super cute, tiny but well furnished. Only one parking space, difficult to find parking if more than one car. Recommend small car for the free parking spot.
The location can’t be beat (especially for the price.) Self check-in as well as parking was all a breeze and if you have any questions regarding your stay, Marc and Tammy are always readily available to assist you. They do a great job of recommending restaurants, shops and nightlife all within walking distance which is just one less thing you have to worry about.
The location is perfect—close enough to San Francisco and surrounding city but away from the chaos of the city. The little house was very clean and well kept. The outdoor shower was a great extra feature— we were a small doubtful about showering in the chilly evenings, but the hot shower with surrounding fairy lights was HEAVENLY.
We loved everything; from the comfy bed to the amazing shower and the large TV to watch movies late at night coming back from the city! He responded always directly and was very flexible too. Location is also perfect.
Speaking of the bed, it's really comfortable and perfect for resting after a day of hiking the hills of San Francisco, and Tyler provides multiple sheet options for you which is a nice touch. He also responds quickly when you have any questions. The Mission District has a great selection of bars, cafés, and restaurants.
I could not have asked for a better experience. We stayed at Tyler’s place for only one night before heading out of town. Check in was easy with a code to the gate and easy access to the unit.
I suddenly needed a quiet spot to work remotely from and this place was perfect. It was great to wake up, open the window or French doors and get to hear all the birds chirping and see the sun filtering in through the trees. Joelle and Dorothy Moser are excellent hosts with a top-notch location.
The atmosphere Brian and Hillary have brought to this loft is fun and I'd recommend it to anyone with some artistic flair who wants a getaway near the Tacoma dome! This peaceful, beautiful studio made us feel transported into a different life. There were sweet little surprises everywhere: a record player and exciting record collection, super cozy beds, romantic twinkle lights, games, puzzles, wise handwritten quotes, unique handmade furniture, fascinating screen printing supplies, ect.
The space is furnished and decorated beautifully. We found beach towels, chairs and toys. He offered us an umbrella as well, but we had brought ours.
Igor and May are such wonderful hosts! Very accommodating and understanding to our arrival, departure, and our needs. The house is quiet and beautiful and very suitable for those who want peace and quit from the city.
I would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend this place enough. My boyfriend and I had a lovely time staying at Christian's! Christian was such a welcoming host who always made certain that we were having a good time and gave us loads of insider tips to better explore the city.
My husband and I had a lovely stay and really appreciated how well stocked the space was. For example,  I’m a light sleeper, so I was thrilled to find a white noise machine by the bedside. Tyler took the time to give us personalized food recommendations, which led us to great neighborhood spots we wouldn’t have found by relying on Yelp alone.
We generally had breakfast and dinner there and had everything available to cook our meals that we have at home - even a french press for coffee! Bedrooms were small but the beds were really comfortable for us. Ceiling fans helped cool things down in the evening and helped to make a good nights sleep.
Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a little loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:  chefs kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. The space is clean, absolutely stylish, homey, and centrally located within walking distance to great attractions that Tacoma has to offer. It was quiet and peaceful amongst the city bustle below which you’ll have an awesome view of.
Only met Neva briefly but she was so nice and I would have enjoyed to spend a bit more time more her for sure if she wasn't heading to Whistler for a ski :) Parking is easy and the room is cozy and comfortable. I'd stay here again in a minute.
The room was small but had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable for a few nights. Overall the house was great but I didn't spend much time in the common  areas save for the backyard which was very pleasant.
The apartment is a cozy upper level with stylish bedroom, intimate living room with small kitchenette with microwave and small refrigerator. The place was beautiful had a lot of natural light and comfortable ambiance. It was in a good location with easy entree to San francisco and points north.
There’s snacks, shampoo, lotions, and other nice touches. Breakfast was delicious, and thoughtfully prepared. Betty Maust, and her husband are very kind people, and you will feel welcome.
The house is spotless! The patio garden is very pretty and Mia was so adorable and calm. My daughter loved her, too!
I have been to many airb bnbs across the world, and this is the one I have felt most welcomed at. We had a marvelous stay at Shelton Gill place. Not only was the space adorable and the views fantastic, but Michael Krieg was truly a host who went above and beyond to make our stay spectacular.
There was good communication with Jeni when we were delayed five hours, The cottage was warm clean and welcoming. The cottage was quiet, and there was plentiful information about how everything worked, and about restaurants and topographical point to go in the neighborhood. Thank you Jeni and Michelle, we'll certainly have you at the top of our list when we're back in Tacoma again
Hot water came out right away (it's really nice to get hot water in this cold winter time), the kitchen made me feel like home (there were foods!! I highly recommended this house if you are traveling with friends or family.
and the house was gorgeous - the photos definitely do not do it justice. Not only that, but Christian is a foodie and an Oakland connoisseur, and he spent 20+ minutes talking to me about restaurants and local food recommendations. His wife also makes bread and they grow oranges in the backyard - what an amazing , hip couple.
The space is small but fairly spacious for 2 people with a nice sized bathroom and small kitchen. Angela went above and beyond in making the space feel special and homey and left treats, snacks, water and breakfast items. Her bikes were a wonderful addition and she provides blankets, towels, even hats for the beach.
What can I say about heather... she is really a super host !!!!!!! One example: In our case, we arrived there after an 18 hour journey . The entrance to the house is as simple as Heather describes it.
This space is a perfect small topographic point right near the beach. Thank you both so much
Everything we needed was there from hangers to coffee to Qtips (an added bonus!) I highly recommend this cottage to anyone visiting Redondo Beach!
Maggie and John are wonderful and thoughtful hosts anyone could ask for! Loved the welcome basket on the table and little candies they put on our beds as well. The amenities are beyond expectation and there's even washing machine and dryer that you can use for free.
A antic spot to relax during your time in Tacoma. The 2 beds (in opposite corners of the large room) are outfitted with fresh, cozy linens and both provide a private space around them. The loft is conveniently located near freeway access as well as walking distance to incredible restaurants, parks and other prime Tacoma attractions.
This small studio is beautifully decorated, very clean, many thoughtful touches, at a professional degree  B and B! I enjoyed being greeted by John Brashier, and then allowed privacy, with a separate entrance and parking spot. The bed is so comfortable I didn’t want to leave, coffee and breakfast options  in the little  kitchen were very welcome, and the lovely neighborhood setting filled with trees was really nice.
Everything listed in the posting is included in your stay, although I would further recommend asking John Mullins about his other businesses and view on the geopolitical landscape for an eye-opening chat. I would absolutely recommend this spot to any traveler passing-through Washington State. There is no doubt that I will return to this Airbnb if I ever find myself passing-through Tacoma again.
This is a must see and must stay home if you’re in the Tacoma area! Thank you Jerry and Julie for being such amazing hosts! :)
The location is outstanding - good area, quite topographic point , private parking and close all places of interests. Very clean. You will feel like home.
Thankful that we had a wonderful & pleasant stay at Lois Davis’s place. She has done a fantastic job making certain no detail is forgotten. Lois Davis took the time to print maps and schedules to help us figure out how to take a quick (cheap) ferry ride over into San Francisco.
Would stay again! This place is great, very clean and has everything you need. Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend these hosts! I was looking for a room in order to take a test at the Tacoma Convention Center. The room has a private mini fridge and Kuerig.
We had a great stay at Tyler's place! Tyler provides next level customer service with directions for every single thing you might have questions on at his place. The room itself is cozy for two people but plenty of space for what we needed.
The neighborhood is clean and charming, and we loved walking around Wrigley Field and Lakeview. This was our best AirBnb experience ever, and Jay and Elisa were helpful and communicative. We will definitely stay here again!
Raquel Eastham place is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museums. There were snacks and a bottle of water in the bedroom (no plastic - yeah!). The kitchen was new, and Arthur Paddick made space in her freezer so we could refreeze our ice for the ice chest.
It has many of the hallmarks of this architecture, like the high ceilings and the ornate crown molding, and because it was located in the back of the house it was surprisingly quiet. The bathroom was also very updated, comfortable and gorgeous. There was great water pressure, and while we noticed the large spa tub, we didn't have time to use it (besides, we're Californians who worry about water use!
George and Colleen welcomed us warmly to their place and provided a lot of helpful tips that helped us navigate the city. What a lovely experience at George and Colleen's place! Colleen's communication prior to arrival was considerate, timely and thoughtful.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. Everything was really really nice her! We would come back to Laura.
! Christopher Brown and Ernie were warm and hospitable hosts. They had clear instructions for check in and Christopher Brown went through how to open/lock the door, the common areas that could be used, and the breakfast snacks that were available for Airbnb guests.
Parking is easy. Shantell Preusser is warm and welcoming (and fluent in both English and Spanish). The accommodation is really good; great shower; spacious closets with lots of shelves and drawers.
I would not hesitate to recommend this listing. The cleanliness of her home was impecable, and the beds, and pillows were super comfortable providing for a great nights sleep. My kids loved that the television had a Roku stick.
Wow, there are so many reasons why this place is a 5-star choice for your lodging needs in DuPont! The suite is convenient and comfortable, yet private and peaceful. From your own private entrance and parking spot to the private bath and secluded garden patio, all things were perfectly appointed!
It’s extremely charming and has a lot of nice little tasteful touches. Angela, the host, was super thoughtful and responsive all the way through. Check in was a breeze.
Michael's loft is simply beautiful, clean and exactly as pictured. Many tourist spots were just a 15-20 minute walk away and it was also close to the riverwalk. There are many good restaurants and bars near by, easily in a perfect location.
Oh my goodness, I wanted to stay forever!! It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. Arthur Paddick was incredibly accommodating when I asked if I could arrive early and very quick to respond to messages.
George and Erik Dickson welcomed us warmly to their place and provided a lot of helpful tips that helped us navigate the city. What a lovely experience at George and Erik Dickson's place! Erik Dickson's communication prior to arrival was considerate, timely and thoughtful.
There are quite few restaurants within biking/ walking distance as well that were recommended by Star and Austin. We loved it!) Thank you for an easy, comfortable stay!
Deanna was a great host and the cottage was fully equipped with everything we needed for our stay— she even left a few tasty treats for us! We absolutely loved everything about it and Deanna was excellent with her communication and making sure we were fully taken care of.
She and her husband live on the property and were available in case we needed anything, but the home was so well-stocked we didn't have any problems! If we are ever in the area again, we would definitely love to return!
It is a beautiful city with spectacular views. We look forward to visiting again in the future.
The cleanliness of her home was impecable, and the beds, and pillows were super comfortable providing for a great nights sleep. They wereable to watch some of their favorite tv shows :) The shower had really nice water pressure. We loved the overall brightness, and the windows gave a pleasant glow to wake up to in the morning.
She was such a great host starting from check in, she checked in on us mid way through our trip and when we checked out. The backyard of the bungalow area was so so cute and one of our favorite parts about the place. She also has bikes available which is such a nice thing.
The bed was super comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and warm blankets. Everything was perfect during our stay here! We were big fans of the cottage and it’s ease of location for us to get around ( grocery store , restaurants, coffee, and shopping are in walking distance).
And they have coasters! I love the earthy artsy vibration a short ton . And at the price!!!
Even though our stay was short, my new wife and I were extremely satisfied and delighted with our stay at Zeena and Howie's home! Zeena is a gracious host and has a lovely home to stay in, with a convenient location close to the sights around Gig Harbor. She has an eye for details and takes care of extra touches to insure that her guests are comfortable and pampered.
The bed was very comfortable and had nice linens. I loved the availability of an assortment of coffees and of course, having beach towels and a bike made me a happy traveler! I would definitely consider staying here again!
Angela was an OUTSTANDING host. What an amazing experience while staying at her place. The place was extremely clean, close to the beach, with all the amenities you will need.
The space is amazing—we loved our loft and the views from the apartment. Michael is so creative, hospitable, and a natural host. Everything we needed was provided and made for a very comfortable stay.
The Loft is perfectly located in the theater area of town, in easy walking distance to a number of interesting breweries and restaurants. We enjoyed the Odd Otter brew pub and the donut place about five doors down. The place was well stocked.
My husband and I traveled with our two small kids (6 and 2) but I also think this would be a perfect spot for a single traveler or a couple looking for a quick getaway. Brent's place was in a great location, the home furnishings were comfortable and very well themed for a beach house, and the space was well utilized for it's size. It's a perfect amount of space for 2-3 people, and the Keurig coffee maker and the huge assortment of coffee flavors was an extra touch that we greatly appreciated after long flights from the West Coast.
I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. The bathroom was beautifully renovated, and it was very nice to have a mini fridge. I didn't think about it in advance, but since there's no kitchen, no water other than from the sink, so I would bring a Brita pitcher or water bottles next time.
My only hesitation would be that it's pretty far from downtown around 30 minutes away and the bus in front took long but Uber was very easy and not as expensive as we thought it would be. Anne's place was great! She let us drop off our bags a few hours early before her already already check-in which was great!
Their home is in a beautiful and very safe neighborhood. Our rooms and bathroom were spotlessly clean. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and would stay with them again.
This studio is in a great location in Bernal Heights, very walkable to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, public transit, and parks. The studio is fairly small but the space is utilized quite efficiently so you have just about everything you could need. My wife and I stayed for three nights with our four month old daughter and had a great time.
Elizabeth was quick to respond to every question we had. We absolutely love the bed and her true care for the comfort of her guests. We even ordered a set of the pillows that she has because they are amazing!
Once inside we were amazed on how clean the whole house (including the private bedroom and bathroom) is! We asked for mexican food and they immediately gave 3 different addresses from "hole in the wall" to "fancy". We are very happy to have stayed there, and so we recommend Tyler's place to everyone!
I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. I would definitely stay with Mona again the next time I'm in Virginia Beach!
One of the best Abnb‘s I‘ve seen so far. Super clean and tidy house and Miranda Malone did everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Very close to the beach with parking spot right in front of the house.
This place was great for my wife and me to stay for the weekend. It’s in a great location where you are a couple minute walk from the beach. We were able to walk and use this bikes to ride to spots around town.
The little extra touches made all the difference and I am not sure I could ever go back to a standard. We were able to walk to the beach restaurants and she even provided some great locations we would not have found on our own. In house there was coffee, popcorn and bathroom items we have not had in standard Airbnb locations.
Only met Neva briefly but she was so nice and I would have enjoyed to spend a bit more time more her for sure if she wasn't heading to Whistler for a ski :) Her little touches are great. The perfect Air BnB host.
Came up for a girls weekend and it was just what we needed. We were allowed to check in early when our flight got in. The loft is super eclectic but it is a working space!!
Christopher Brown and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! Nice map of the vicinity in the room. There is so much to see and do in Chicago, stay a while!
I really can't find a single thing to list here that I didn't like. Overall, a antic topographic point to stay. I will be back and try to stay here anytime I'm in the Chesapeake, Virginia Beach, Norfolk area.
Numerous personal touches make staying here a very relaxing and enjoyable time. Tiana is readily available and takes personal pride to ensure that  her guests are completely satisfied with the lodging. We will definitely stay there in the future.
Jeff and Mike are extremely friendly and helpful hosts. The suite is large and spacious, with high ceilings and a great overhead fan. Funky artwork throughout, which we appreciated.
Scott is a great host, stays out of your way but very helpful if you need any local recommendations. His is space is just what we needed, and enjoying am coffee outside on his deck in the morning sun was perfect!
Linda/Mike thought we knew it was a 12pm check out and when we told our hosts we thought 1pm, they did not rush us at all, even though they had to prep for their next reservations at 2pm. Definitely would stay again with Linda/Mike. Very respectfully in giving us our space but very accommodating to all our needs.
Clean, cozy, private, amenities, bicycles, coffee machine, microwave and a small fridge in the room. Location is excellent! Robert Turpen and Erik Dickson and the most wonderful hosts!
Maggie and Shantell Preusser were amazing hosts. The space is gorgeous and very clean. They were even nice enough to let us drop off our bags hours before check in time.
It's an enjoyable experience staying at Jodi Stallings place. We stayed 8 nights there and were very satisfied with the place. The room is at the back of the house and it stands alone in the garden.
Tiana was exceptional to deal with. Her topographic point is immaculate and in an amazing location, steps to the beach and she provides bikes (which are in such great condition) to use the bike path along the ocean. Tiana responded to every message I sent within minutes and she was very considerate and genuinely wanted to make sure we arrived safely and seamlessly.
We loved getting to chat with her. The cottage was sparkling clean, beautifully decorated, and stocked with any amenity one might need during their stay, be it toiletries, board games/DVDs, or pantry items to snack on! There are lots of sweet helpful signs placed strategically around the space that add a warm, personal touch to the cottage.
Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed amenities. This unit is for sleeping and (Website hidden by Airbnb) not like you’re going to sit inside in roomy comfort. It’s bright, clean and Arthur Paddick supplies you with just about everything you need, to have a nice, comfortable stay.
I love the earthy artsy vibe a ton. We drew, played guitar, watched shows, played pool, did our makeup in the mirror, took pictures, made coffee and tea, played games, listened to vinyls, etc we took advantage of all the place had to offer us! Brian and Hillary are so kind too!
I enjoyed sunbathing and decompressing there. Laurie’s granola was outstanding and Thomas George’s conversation was much appreciated—I learned about their home because I inquired and he was gracious about telling me. From the apt I walked all the way home from UCal Berkeley and the Botanical Garden, which is probably only for people who love to walk as I do.
The neighbourhood is quiet, the apartment immaculate, and the bed was Very Comfortable (so much so that we had a full night's sleep, even with jet lag!!) We enjoyed our stay, though it might be a little pricey for the space; it is essentially a well appointed basement apartment where no cooking is allowed. (this is where the four stars kicked in) There were plenty of delicious treats however, and a microwave is in the kitchen for warming up take-away food.
They also had great beach cruisers that they lend to guest , and we had a great time exploring the area and beaches with the bikes. Great stay, would def stay again if we're back in the area.
So kind. Noe Valley is a lovely starting point to SF exploration. We spent an entire day walking around the Mission and Castro districts—both within easy walking distance.
The location is great for walks and getting to the beach. Marcia shared some tips on best time of day to go which was helpful so I could collect some shells for my kids! The snack cart was super helpful and made the place feel more homey!
We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. Angelas place was one of the best Airbnb experience EVER! She was such a wonderful host and greeted us when we arrived ( added bonus: with her adorable puppy Lauren Jensen).
I think you never regret if you will chose Melisa's house. There is Food Lion not so far from house and you can drink coffee every morning. So I am sure you will love this place.
Christopher Brown and Crystal Romero are so responsive and kind and make checking in and out so very easy. If you are going to a concert in Tacoma this is the place to be. The Tacoma Done is right up the street; you cannot beat the location.
The kitchen and living areas are comfortable (only two chairs at the table, though) and nicely decorated. Communication with Erik Dickson was fabulous -- we had a couple of small issue , and she addressed them immediately. A few notes for the faint of heart: The stairs leading up to the space are indeed steep (worth it, we thought).
The position from the back bedroom was priceless - Mount Rainer in all its glory and sparkling city lights overlooking the Sound... Jodi Stallings's Airbnb is one to not skip out on! If you love the feel of a modern brand new place, this is the spot that you would enjoy.
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. I would definitely recommend staying here, Marcia has many nice touches and the unit is private and a good price.
Before I been there, the host sent me  a lot of notes to help me find this house. On top of that, the location is awesome - two blocks from the beautiful beach and the bike path and close to lots of restaurants. We loved that bikes were provided!
This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud. This is the second time my family has stayed at Brian and Lois Davis's amazing space in Tacoma and we loved it! Such a creative, open, beautiful space with lots of fun amenities!
She took the time to drop us to whole food which was just about 15 minutes away from the house by walk, not because we expected it, but it was a spur of the moment indication of what kind of host she would be. The accommodations felt thoughtful. Wish we could have stayed longer.
She put a lot of thought into finding quality eateries.. everything from coffee shops and greasy spoons, to seafood and Mexican. The apartment itself is spotless and stylish. The mattress is very comfortable and she has every variety of pillow you can think of!
We especially loved the bed and duvet which are super comfy and the bathroom is great. There are lots of restaurants and shops in the area and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Some reviewer and Jose himself mentioned that he and his family live above the apartment but we barely heard them to be honest.
There was a list of tips provided for us to go to eat, get coffee/drinks, etc. Fans of modern architecture will love what has been done in such a tiny cottage. Clean, cozy, comfortable (if you are willing to navigate a tight staircase a few times each day).
Edwin Green is a fantastic host, with a gorgeous home rich in history; we couldn’t have been happier. I had a little trepidation at first, I am not someone who knows Tacoma well and the direction I came from was not great. I pulled up to the cabin and saw a charming well-taken care of abode, with a grill out front and little hearts carved into the wood panels for the railing.
We have stayed here annually and sometimes twice a year for the last four years and have ALWAYS felt welcomed, at home and comfortable. Joan Litwin and Marc are exponential on what they do and are by far the most amazing and accommodating hosts ever. The room itself is perfectly tidy and ridiculously clean; Private and cozy, but enough space for us to live here comfortable for a week each time.
She laid out a wonderful spread of breakfast goodies each morning, which was so nice. We had the upstairs room  and while it said a shared bathroom I think we were the only ones using it. The back deck is really awesome to sit on in the morning with a cup of coffee or enjoy the cool evenings.
The love of my life and  sweetheart Was so happy to stay there. This has created the most wonderful experience and weekend. Tiana and her husband invited us to use the bikes to go riding.
We had more than enough space and the entire lot is very private with a beautiful backyard if you want to take a few moments to observe nature. We both felt super comfortable and Christine responded immediately to our questions when we checked in. The cherry on top were the 2 bikes included next to the house which we used the entire weekend.
I'd be very pleased to stay there again. This place is like your home away from home. It was immaculately clean, very comfortable and beautifully decorated.
One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located. The door slides open/ closed. It does not lock.
There’s an adorable patio, wine glasses and a wine opener hehe, as well as a bunch of neat shops and restaurants just a few blocks away. Yet, they were all still close enough to walk to and enjoy. It’s also a nice neighborhood so I definitely felt safe.
TV is HUGH! lol   The drink and bite where great added touch. Location to Seattle...about 1hr drive to Pike Place Market.
Michael Krieg and Curt’s place is perfect; a home away from home. We loved all the extra touches — great art and stylish space, snacks and nespresso, a booklet full of Chicago suggestions, extra Ventra cards, and even classical music playing upon our arrival! Their hospitality made this one of our favorite Airbnb experiences.
I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list. We would return to stay again. plus we highlyrecommend this place for others.
Elizabeth is a kind, friendly host. She made it easy to access the room ahead of the advertised check-in time. The room is clean and spacious with a nice private bathroom, a balcony and a large satellite TV.
The house was cosy and beautiful, & it’s so nicely decorated! Looks so much better in real life as compared to the photos! Requested for some fire log on our last night to set a little fire outside the house, and George was so fast in helping us to set it up after hearing our request, he even went ahead & hang some pretty lights outside for us, really makes us feel so happy!
My first trip to San Francisco would not have been the same if I had stayed anywhere but Brenda’s. Brenda is more than accommodating. She makes you feel welcome, offers tips and advice for exploring the city and will go out of her way to make sure you feel at home (like giving me an umbrella for when the weather worsened).
Neva was out of town and asked someone else to look after the house. Jesse  the sweet dog licks the guests to show her friendship.The courtyard is beautiful and the room is cozy, everything is perfect. My friend's home is nearby,they brought  their kids to visit me and also thought that I had a good choice.
She has done a fantastic job making sure no detail is forgotten. This saved us quite a bit of money and time for parking and driving in the crazy traffic. The neighborhood and Alameda area were extremely safe and clean.
Amazing hospitality. Only negative: no conditioner in shower
Wow- we have used Airbnb so many times but this was by far our best experience! The “ plus” exceeded our expectations. The little extra touches made all the difference and I am not sure I could ever go back to a standard.
So you’re really a light in my stay and I would not able to this without you guy’s. !
A great getaway topographic point ! My husband and I took a few days together away from the kids to enjoy the beach & this place was perfect - cute, clean, and walking distance from the beach and almost every restaurant & activity we enjoyed during our trip. Star & Austin were great hosts and checked in with us several times throughout the visit to make sure we had everything we needed.
Every recommendation was spot on and she was beyond hospitable. I took him to Disneyland on day 3 and she gave us all the tips to navigate the park and probably saved us hours with her inside knowledge. We were beyond impressed and the next time we head down, we will definitely be staying there again.
Wow, what can I say! Like all their other guest , I agree this home is spectacular for its location, privacy, comfort, and the most hospitable hosts. The garden is so peaceful and lovely in the morning where we had morning coffee.
There’s snacks, shampoo, lotions, and other nice touches. Breakfast was delicious, and thoughtfully prepared. Zeena, and her husband are very kind people, and you will feel welcome.
This is a phenomenal place to stay. I’d highly recommend it to anyone World Health Organization ’s in town or just wants to a weekend to relax, plus you’re close to the beach
She had a nice bottle of wine & some yummy chocolates waiting for us on arrival. She was easy to communicate with and always available with a quick response. We had everything we could possibly need and more.
The location felt like a secret hideout , with Zeena's interior designer touches making it feel warm and inviting. You will, too.
This little cottage is a great find, and Shelton Gill is an incredibly generous host. There was a wide variety of breakfast food, and even some snack food. I stay in a lot of Airbnbs, and many do not provide these items.
The kitchen was stocked really well with cooking utensils, and some breakfast options were available, along with a great array of breakfast beverages. After dinner, we got our kiddo put to bed and took the baby monitor with us to relax in the hot tub. It was the perfect place to relax after a day of traveling!
This place was exactly as shown in the pictures! At first we struggled hard to find parking but Jennifer Merry instructions on parking are pretty clear and very helpful. The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Jennifer Merry place and convenient!
Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. He has thought of EVERY detail...hair dryer, bath robes, coffee, phone chargers, white noise, a mini fridge, and snacks (other little things too , but those at the things that were really a “wow” factor for me!). He was also so generous and let us check in early after a flight that arrived before check in time.
In fact, one can virtually arrive with their clothing and will find all they need in full stock at the cottage. Proctor Cottage exceeds expectations. We stayed a week and wish we could have stayed longer.
The living structure they've created for travelers is very special, but the location is really what makes this place a gem. Redondo is a safe, quiet and clean little community with a great beach and pier, that's about a 30-45 minute drive from everything in the greater LA area. The walk to the beach takes one minute, and the walk for fantastic fast food is literally 30 seconds away!
I can’t wait to go back believe me when I say this guy went above and beyond and it was second to none! This place was perfect for our family of four. The sand is steps from the bottom of the stairs, and the beach is perhaps 30 steps from there, just over the dune.
As for me, I will always book my future stays at Heather's Private Cozy Cottage!! Heather’s “cozy”cottage was just that: cozy! We stayed in her cottage for 6 days in late-December.
The location is great too - near lots of barroom and restaurants  The room has so many personal touches and Tyler has thought of every small detail from iPhone chargers, bath robes to ear plugs. The style of the room is super  cool too - it feels like staying in a room at the ace hotel. We only had two days to explore SF so we only used this room as a base but would love to have spent more time here.
Paul is an awesome host! He had us over for a quick drink before our first night of exploring and gave us a ton of great tips for the area. He did a great job of making some suggestions, perfect for the kind of experience we were looking for!
The first thing I will say is: Book Susan's topographic point ! You will not be sorry. The space is very comfortable and spacious and spotlessly clean.
We will definitely return! The Ship Watch was amazing! The position was to die for!!
We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. Loveeeeee this place! Its make me and my friend feel like a home-y!
Dan & Traci are also really great hosts! (her Quiche is a must-try btw). Overall, my sister and I had a wonderful experience at their lovely home and would definitely recommend to you future travelers!
The room is clean and big and the shower has the best water pressure I’ve ever felt! We wanted to have a picnic one day and Luis Hawkins provided us with a cooler to use. Nothing was too much trouble for him.
Thanks for a great stay :) Perfect place for a solo traveller, or even a couple. Very comfy bed, great shower and close to the beach areas.
This was our first time booking an Airbnb and the bar is set really high for any future bookings anywhere else. The location is great. The loft is beautifully decorated, very cozy and very clean.
A beautiful place very clean and everything you need. We hope to stay here again on our next visit.
Would highly recommend this Airbnb! It was delicious! Apartment is beautifully decorated and such a beautiful patio.
Being a loft apartment, the bedroom isn't the most private but it was fine for me. His flamboyant rooftop is certainly a highlight of the place, especially if the weather is good. One of the most memorable moments of my trip was sitting out on the rooftop with a very friendly couple who were also staying with Michael through airbnb.
I have stayed at Airbnbs all over the world but this room has been by far the best. His Airbnb is in a great central location and close to lots of food and transportation. He was quick to respond to my questions and allowed me to drop off my luggage before check in.
The bed was cozy and the Alexa was helpful because I always fall asleep to music and I forgot my Bluetooth speaker. I actually rebooked her place before I even got three because she was booked out months in advance. I figured if all these reviews were wrong I had 48 hours to cancel — and sure enough every review was true true true.
Very close to the beach, quite neighborhood. Would definitely stay again. 5 stars!
I was in town for a wedding and wanted to stay close to the beach. This space is even bigger in person than I expected from the photos! Jeremy Johnson was so friendly and welcoming.
We had an amazing stay at Tiana’s place. Check in was very easy and Tiana allowed us to check in early. She also kept checking on us making certain we had fresh towels, water bottles etc.
It’s extremely charming and has a lot of nice little tasteful touches. She made for a great stay. The location is outstanding and very safe.
The parking is at the back and there is a narrow pathway next to the house where you can walk from  the parking batch to the front door. We love the kitchen and dinning area where we cooked breakfast and heated up leftovers. The lone thing is the air condition was quite loud.
Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/ bakery , etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble.
It's so clean and bright that you're likely never going to have that common feeling many of us have in hotels where we feel like we need to spray them down with disinfectant to keep our skin from crawling. It's intelligently staged with nice amenities that come in helpful, and she's thought of everything a beach traveler might need. Tiana has a great team that takes care of the space, is nearby if you need assistance, and will provide everything you could ever need.
Raquel Eastham was a wonderful host! It's close to several beaches as well as plenty of restaurants and businesses. It's a great topographic point to stay if you're looking to explore the area.
Wiseacre is dripping in mid-century goodness, local history, beautiful art, and a generous host at its core. We booked Chuck's home for 4 nights with 10 guests and we had plenty of elbow room! Our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to  Chuck's experienced guidance.
I actually rebooked her place before I even got three because she was booked out months in advance. Her topographic point is a treasure.
Outside of surge pricing, average cost of Uber trips was around $15 (for somewhere in Oakland/the Bay) up to around $20 (if you wanted to make the trek over the bridge to someplace in San Francisco). Sometimes on the way back to the Airbnb the Uber drivers will get confused (Oakland is huge lol), but if you tell them that you're going to the "Oakland hills" that'll help them out a bit. The home: SO clean.
What really solidified my confidence in staying in this home was Marcos Blount cordial reception . Beautiful little gem. Quiet, very private, serene.
The bed was wonderfully comfortable, full cable tv and a large and well-equipped bathroom. The place was immaculately clean with furniture updates that the pictures don't reflect. Bennie Dudgeon was a great resource for things to do locally and restaurants to try.
We had so much fun and can’t wait to come back some day. My boyfriend and I spent a week in San Francisco to celebrate our anniversary and see his friends, so we wanted a place close to the city but also close to the beach. This place is amazing!!
But don't let that stop you from booking this gem! As said in the description- it can be pretty noisy at night. City noises- trains, cars, people- but that is fully stated and there are ear plugs left for guests for that reason.
Strongly recommend. Star and Austin's home was clean and comfortable - I felt at home as soon as we walked in the door! They had shampoo, conditioner, soaps, towels, even bikes and beach chairs!
Morning sunrise and evening sunset are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ foot height windows sprawling the open area. Quality! Creativity!
The space provided was beyond comfortable, and Mona's communication was excellent! Definitely great for a morning stroll before heading to the beach. Additionally the neighborhood is also extremely close to an assortment of restaurants and other entertainment outside of just the beach.
She even took the time to write out a lengthy recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant spots were out of this world! Make sure that you make time to meet with her if possible before you go! She has an really inspiring story!
Alan  and Ruth McGuffog We stayed at Maggie's and John's house for 2 nights. It was an awesome place.
We were met with incredible hospitality, a beautiful space, a super friendly porch, and a fantastic location. We left feeling like we’d made friends  We WILL be returning!!! !
What a gorgeous place! The view in and of itself was soothing and visually interesting (enjoyed spying on a bald eagle, Canadian geese, great egrets, herons, and few smaller perching birds; the trees were also varied and impressively mature), but the interior was stylish and cozy as well (can't wait to see the upstairs!). The location was convenient to both major highways and our friends, as well as grocery stores and plenty of restaurants.
There even were freezer packs in the freezer. They gave us a selection of maps and Ben gave us some great suggestions and detailed directions for day trips, public transportation, restaurants etc. The lovely courtyard with fish pond and plants is spectacular and the on site laundry much appreciated.
I stayed in the vintage time capsule for 3 months with no issues. There are also a bunch of restaurants here as well. Shopping is close by at Bay Street in Emeryville or fourth street in Berkeley (all of which Michael has laid out in a convenient welcome book) Easy to get into SF by the Bart at the Fruitvale station.
• Street parking is a little competitive and cars have to be moved off the street in the later afternoon when the parking lane becomes a traffic lane. Everything was as it was presented by Natalia, who was a thoughtful and attentive hostess. We were in town to help our daughter move into an apartment walking distance from the Air BnB.
If you're looking for a great place to stay, look no further! This suites location gives you a feel of what living in the city is like. You have everything in a short walk from the door, albeit the hills make for a good workout.
We really appreciated all the little details you put in to make this spot special. -Dakota & Trent
The bed was comfortable, room stylish, great lighting and open space with vaulted ceilings (which I’m a sucker for). Great visit! Hope to be back again in the summer months!
Peg and Jeff's place was charming and exactly as pictured! Their lower level suite was spacious, clean, and filled with natural light. The bed and was super comfy with quality quality sheets and a cozy duvet.
It’s a beautiful space; alone style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. The place is only about a 10 minute walk from the BART station. I appreciated that Roku was set up on the TV, too.
Neva's in-law unit was the perfect location for a little weekend getaway at the end of a week of conferences in LA. It's super close to both Redondo and Hermosa beach and it was easy to get to and from the board walks and restaurants. The unit is a perfect size for two people and came with all the amenities you'd need.
Brian and Hillary are so responsive and kind and make checking in and out so very easy. If you are going to a concert in Tacoma this is the place to be. The Tacoma Done is right up the street; you cannot beat the location.
The area is convenient with walking distance to wholefoods and shops and the pier. We felt safe walking around at night. Angela was responsive and made sure our check-in went smoothly.
We stayed with our two kids this time, but we'll be back again for a long trip to enjoy this fun property close to the beach and some great restaurants (try Mama D's, especially if you have kids. Had the best time! Robert Huckabaa is so cute and well kept.
We did walk to the Jewel grocery store—which was an easy distance though I would be cautious doing so after dark (as you would do anywhere in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) special concerns). It was lovely to begin the day with morning coffee in the darling courtyard space (espresso and/or coffee, tea, cream and misc. snacks provided—thanks, Ken).
The house was so amazingly clean and the host are so sweet and thoughtful. It was pouring raining and they gave me an umbrella. I needed to steam my clothes and they provided me with a soft-shell clam .
Linda and her house are very warm and welcoming. Super quiet neighborhood with 6th just two blocks away. Wouldn’t even know it.
Angela was a very gracious & helpful host. The bungalow was nicely decorated and stocked with supplies for continental breakfast. The location was very convenient to the beach & groceries.
Everything was well equipped. Christina was a great host and made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable. She recommended some great places to check out in Oakland during my visit.
The bed and linens were over the top comfy and the bathroom and Joseph Lewis was stylish and updated. We were surprised by the amenities offered such as teas, coffee, luxury toiletries, local guides and even a bidet! Just the right amount of communication as well, accessible but private and Bennie Dudgeon is a terrific person we looked forward to talking with.
Everything was nice and clean and the price value ratio is very good. We enjoyed our stay. Beds were comfortable, everything was clean and nice.
Whole Foods is just a few short blocks down the hill. Or you can borrow a bicycle and ride over to the Village or to the pier as well. Lori Stewart was super nice and flexible and we appreciated being allowed to use the washer dryer.
Literally 2 blocks from the beach. The space was clean and very modern. Would definitely stay here again.
The day of the trip, I realized that the cabin was only supposed to welcome 2 people so I told Chip, and he was very nice at accommodating this last minute change. The place is so stylish, it has everything you need for an awesome time (coffee, teas, grill, salt, pepper, monopoly, fire)....during the day we walked up the hill to a lighthouse, we grilled, and sat in the morning on the deck for a nice cup of tea. I will absolutely come back!
We realized right away that Bob and Sharann could easily charge twice the amount they are asking for each night, just because of the value of the place alone. The space is very clean and decorated beautifully with antiques all over to enjoy. We had a great time relaxing by the fireplace, eating the many snacks left for us (NOT on the bed ;) This is a one of a kind deal that we would definitely recommend to anyone looking for their own private fancy suite hosted by two amazing people!
It was just the right size for our time in the Sunset Beach area, it had a lot of quaint local places to eat at, and it was super easy to use the Muni Transportation to get to all the San Francisco places we wanted to visit. The lone suggestion we have would be for the upstairs neighbors to be a small quieter in the mornings. We were woken up to running at 6:00 am both morning .
Enjoy!!! Jeremy Johnson place was perfect for our 2 night stay in San Francisco . It was exactly what we needed as a launching pad to explore the city.
"First-aid!" or "More coffee in the freezer" was very great. There is a manual of 'rules' on the table and I was thinking that it was going to be one of 'those kind' but when I opened it - it really was a how-to guide on how to make yourself at home.
A beautiful place very clean and everything you need. Tiana is the best and will give you  recommendtions for what to do and where to eat. Will definately stay there again if the opportunity arises.
She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. John Brashier place was really clean and really comfortable. It's a good size for one person or a couple.
Super convenient. Not to mention the beds were extremely comfortable! Would definitely love to stay here again if ever in the Chicago area.
Of particular note was a most excellent shower - an area that can be shoehorned in at some other places, especially when the rental has been crafted out of a basement or loft . Linda and her house are very warm and welcoming. A great place to decompress and relax.
Luis Hawkins called me day of to see if I wanted an early check-in and also to confirm my muffin choice. Highly recommend! !
Everything was thought up! Everything you could’ve possibly need for the kitchen was there. Everything that you could possibly need it for the bathroom was also there!
It is walking distance to the Beach and Robert Huckabaa has Bikes and Boggie Boards for your stay. We will diffently stay again
Our secret hideout . Arnold Jackson and Marc make it fun and easy going.
We loved starting the day hanging out on the cute little porch swing, listening to the birds. That area really is the perfect place for a little retreat - so peaceful! Be sure to come here if you want to experience the quieter (better) side of Virginia Beach!
We loved leaving the door open at night so our little one could run in and out. This is for certain our new spot to stay whenever we are in the area!
Would recommend! !
Was a perfect start to our roadtrip. Paul was very helpful and made checking in really easy. Would recommend to anyone who wants to unwind for a few days.
We are happy to recommend Tyler’s apartment. My wife and I spent 4 days at Tyler’s Airbnb and enjoyed every minute of it. We’d planned this trip for 13 years and finally got a chance to get away by ourselves without the kids and explore San Francisco.
Location was amazing with lots of great restaurants in the area. Jeff is the best AirBnB host we’ve ever had. He and Mike sent us a very detailed message before our arrival with great suggestions of things to do, and also spent several minutes upon our arrival ensuring we knew the area, and answering any questions.
Book this place now! Thank you Marcia for your amazing cordial reception .
I can’t wait until my next Oakland visit and the chance to stay at the casita! On our last trip we stayed in several hotels and dined out every night. This time we wanted something more cost effective, more homey, and a kitchen to prepare meals.
The loft was absolutely spotless, beautifully and tastefully furnished, and really fun (games, puzzles, pool table, music, and even a scooter!) Well located for downtown Tacoma, the Glass Museum, and Point Defiance Park. This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud.
Neva's place was great! Everything was clean and comfortable, and we had a very pleasant, peaceful stay. Not only was the room everything we expected (and more) but Neva went the extra mile to accommodate our late checkout.
Everything listed in the posting is included in your stay, although I would further recommend asking Jimmy about his other businesses and view on the geopolitical landscape for an eye-opening chat. Guests are guaranteed privacy, cleanliness and expedient service at this location. The host, Jimmy, even helped me return the keys that I left on the front porch of his home and also volunteered to host my bicycle at no extra charge.
there is great detail paid to the extra special touches like soft sheets, comfy bed and plush towels. I was visiting the Tacoma/Seattle area as a solo vacation trip and they were super helpful and responsive in terms of ideas of local attractions and what I should make time to see and any questions I had in general. This was my first airbnb experience and I would absolutely visit their home again if I am back in Tacoma.
The Host was amazing. Used the bikes and grillroom . Has all you need and if you need anything the host will provide.
The amenities are of a great quality and we had everything we needed. Laura and Ralph are lovely people and made us all feel welcome. I would not hesitate to recommend this listing.
The bed was very comfortable and had nice linens. I loved the handiness of an assortment of coffee and of course, having beach towels and a bike made me a happy traveler! I would definitely consider staying here again!
This was a beautiful Airbnb that is just blocks from the beach. The location cannot be beat, and the decor was beautiful and well thought out. Bennie Dudgeon was a great host with amazing recommendations for anyone unfamiliar with the area!
They absolutely loved it. I had a great stay at Shelton Gill and Shelton Gill place! Started with clear communication, flexible check-in, and a warm welcome.
Lois Davis was very thoughtful in the special touch she adds to her space like having beer and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived and making bikes available for us. One of my best Airbnb stays to date!
Dorothy Moser little bungalow is the perfect, cozy getaway! Located right outside of San Francisco, the traffic can get a little crazy and you have to be creative with your parking, but we loved the opportunity to experience the culture of Oakland! Arthur Paddick was a great host and the cottage was fully equipped with everything we needed for our stay— she even left a few tasty treats for us!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Paul’s place. The location is fantastic, and the accommodation is modern, really comfortable and well-equipped. Paul is an excellent host and was extremely helpful throughout our stay.
Gorgeous views! So real, that I now have made a new friend and will visit here once per year - to see my family and to see Chuck again. Don't hesitate - the airport is only 6 minutes away.
Super cunning , useful, and thoughtful things like this are everywhere you turn, including in the bathroom (which had everything we needed). The breakfast my husband and I had was excellent (eggs, toast, cereal, fruit, cereal, etc), and we were allowed to eat on the deck (which was incredibly lovely). Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest.
Being a single woman, I wanted some place safe and I found it at Elizabeth's. She took considerable time and effort to secure not only her home, but your room. I know anyone World Health Organization has the pleasure of staying here, will enjoy their stay.
Super welcoming and helpful host . Loved our stay!! !
Also, because this place is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood. Let’s start with communications with Tyler was quick, simple, and clear. I can tell that he takes much effort into making sure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
The guest house was very clean and spacious. It has great amenities, and Paul is an awesome host! Checking-in to make sure everything is up to expectations, quick to respond to any questions, and very friendly!
Tiana was great and helpful host. We will definitely be back and will recommend this topographic point for our friends visiting LA.
It is as nice as it seems in the pictures. The location is ideal if you are after the awesome beach vibes and laid back athmosphere. It’s easily reachable by car and there is a parking spot in front of the cottage.
We found the inclusion of some fun games and activities to be very charming as well. Wow ... what a sweet little cottage by the beach ... all the amenities, and Chip is an exemplary host - flexible, cordial and there if needed ... full access to yard and beach, with high tides rising half way up the bulkhead - a few feet down the ladder and you are in the swim - seriously, who needs a dock ... still, I might want flippers in those waters - the current looks swift to me ... still, a great place to swim, if you can handle the cold ... water clear, you can see through to the rocks at the bottom ... anyway, a great place to stay, a wonderful getaway, spring green forest - and more affordable than any hotels/motels in the area ... there are some other AirBnB locations, a few bead and breakfasts on the islands ... most look more expensive to me ... so, if you are looking to spend some time at the beach, in a lovely, quiet space - right on the beach - check in with Chip ... you'll be happy you did!
This is an amazing discovery in a city crowded with excellent list . I'll definitely be looking to stay here again on my next trip to San Francisco, you should too.
This place is PHENOMENAL!!! We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds. The amenities provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush?
Before I been there, the host sent me  a batch of notes to help me find this house. The host helped me and showed me how to operate the light . That’s an excellent experience.
Boardwalk and other cool spots aren’t much further either. Richard Batton was welcoming and accommodating. Place was cozy, clean and comfortable.
Christina's place is GREAT. The apartment is located very close to old Tacoma and while it is on a busy street, parking was ample and the location, tucked down away from the street, meant that there was no noticeable street noise. Everything about this stay was easy and pleasant and Christina was very responsive.
Roberta Hallenbeck guest house was very clean, nicely decorated and well stocked. The beaches in the area are beautiful and provide many mile of bike trails.
Easy to reach. The location is a littlebit out of the Centre. It takes 30 min.
Our group of 6 loved our stay at the Polk Street Coach House. We felt very safe the entire time and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood and testing out nearby restaurants by foot. The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were lots of little extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of game for us to play after a long day on our feet.
The bed is extremely cozy and comfortable. We were headed to San Diego for the next part of our trip and needed a quick laundry fix. Michael Krieg is by far the best Airbnb host.
It is beautifully decorated and the hosts have thought of everything! It is one of my very favorite AirBnB experiences.
The loft is very spacious, stylish, comfortable, surprisingly private despite the location, and secure. The downtown location was very convenient to some local sites, and also easy to get to UPS (college kid drop off trip). We hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future.
The cottage itself was cute, cozy and comfortable. He was a very personable and genuinely nice guy. Communication was very easy and although everything ran smoothly we felt like if anything had arisen Alejandrina Anderson and Dan would be very easy to reach and take care of anything within their power.
I love Redondo Beach; Miranda Malone is a great place to stay. Lot's of beach activity, restaurants and stores are near by. Parking is easy.
He also showed us their beautiful backyard which was exuberant and refreshing, and was able to take Instagram worthy pictures in the garden and pond. We highly recommend Ben and Mike’s home. Thank you so much for hosting us!Hope we cross paths again!
The popular dinner/bar spot “MUA” is only a 6 minute drive away. There are plenty of outlets around the studio, and the different light options are a plus. I didn’t want to leave!
Actually tried to come back on my return to SF but sadly it was already booked. Slept very well in the comfortable bed with divine sheets. Remember if you require a kettle to ask Jeff and he will happily provide one.
Igor and May are such wonderful hosts! Our room was clean, we were provided with towels, and there was a cute loft upstairs, which we did not have time to use. Loved the air conditioner in our room!!!
We knew what type of place we were heading into from the photos, but when we actually arrived  we were so surprised on how beautiful this topographical point was in person. Lucky for us, the sun was out this week so we got a beautiful view of the water, and Gregory Simons was kind enough to let us see more of the view from her own balcony. The room itself had a warm welcoming feeling.
He also responds quickly when you have any question . There's also a BART station not too far away, but we never needed to use it. Overall it was a great stay, and really was like the hotel experience in Francis Jones's home which is quite impressive, especially since you'd be paying a far higher rate for the hotel equivalent and it would be far less personalised.
This was our favourite Airbnb yet! The hospitality from Tyler was incredible. Great communication and ease of check in.
Scott was so thoughtful in every detail of setting up our stay. and MORE.) Great location as well.
Beautiful neighborhood. More than I expected. Beautiful tree and flowers everywhere.
An amazing Airbnb experience....our stay at Lindsay Brown's place was great in every manner . Our stay there could not have gone better....highly recommend!
We had a marvelous stay at Sheri Vowell's place. When we had trouble w our car, she offered to drive us 30 minutes to take care of the issue. We can not thank her enough for this generosity.
House was beautiful. Elizabeth was great with communicating with me and responded very quickly. Room was just as pictured, bathroom was broad and clean.
She went out of her manner to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates.
Paul allowed me to check in early so I could enjoy a ride on one of the complimentary beach bikes which was just what I needed after my long flight. A+++
Neva was out of town and asked someone else to look after the house. Robert Huckabaathe sweet dog licks the guests to show her friendship.The court is beautiful and the room is cozy, everything is perfect. My friend's home is nearby,they brought  their child to visit me and also thought that I had a good choice.
While we were just behind the chief house there was never any noise or disturbance and we had tons of privacy. A really lovey place!
The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. Joe was having some electrical issues in the bathroom, so he put in a lamp. However, in the daytime, sun shines in through the skylight, providing natural light in the bathroom.
Loved the quaint and comfortable home! The host was responsive and checked on us to ensure access and arrival. Would stay again!
It is the best Ikea styling I have ever seen in real life. • The kitchen (and the electric refrigerator in particular) were sparkling clean. It was stocked with more than the basics, which was great since we always shop for breakfast food when we arrive in a new city, and found a Trader Joe’s quite nearby.
Nevas place was adorable and so comforting. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was so luxurious. We are glad to have met her on our way out and wish we saw Jesse!
I had a great stay at Matthew An and Jeff’s place! Matthew An provided a lot of great suggestions on surrounding restaurants and pointed out close by places like Billy Goat Hill (which is just up the street and has great views). It’s a very convenient location- walkable, close to muni stops, and easy to get a lyft.
The house catered to a relaxing and freeing weekend. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and will for certain be back to see Chip and Oliver (his dog) again.
The cottage is NOT a basement apartment, either which is great. Really worth the stay.
SOL, Times Square etc. Overall, I would recommend this adjustment .
The bed was wonderfully comfortable, full cable tv and a large and well-equipped bathroom. The place was immaculately clean with furniture updates that the pictures don't reflect. Marc was a great resource for things to do locally and restaurants to try.
Her bikes were a wonderful addition and she provides blankets, towels, even hats for the beach. She has thought of everything. The location is ideal- minutes walk from the beach and restaurants.
Folks - This topographic point and experience is AMAZING. Raquel Eastham is present when you ask/need him or invisible if you just seek silence however I must add, Raquel Eastham and his wonderful four legged friend Charlotte are sooooo much fun. Raquel Eastham is a wealth of information, knowledge, traveled experiences, amazing people he was worked with/for, you will not regret staying here, I promise you.
Target is a much cleaner, safer option. Thanks again!
Thank you so much for hosting us!Hope we cross paths again! Firstly Mike and Ben are possibly the best hosts I've ever had at an airbnb. They are amazing.
This home is in a great location, a few blocks from the pier and a short Uber ride from LAX. Elizabeth was a great detailed communicator, super flexible, and very kind. We enjoyed our stay!
We used them not only to get to the beach, but to get all around town. The room itself is very clean and comfortable and provides all the things you'd need to get out to the beach for the day or to enjoy a restful morning or evening on the couch. We also appreciated the provided coffee and to-go cups and the fridge/freezer combo.
It was the cutest cottage ever! it was soooo.... perfect and amazing. I coordinated the stay at the last minute and Tiana.
Susan called me day of to see if I wanted an early check-in and also to confirm my muffin choice. Highly recommend! !
Lovely place to stay during my first (hopefully, not the last) trip to San Francisco. I arrived rather late in the evening (around 9:30ish), and Chris came out to greet me and show me the place. As a solo traveler, it’s important for me to feel safe and secure wherever I’m staying ... even more so when being so far from home.
We had a lovely stay here and would come back in a heartbeat! Miranda Malone was so welcoming and responsive, and very thoughtful about making sure that we had everything we needed. The coach house is bright and spacious, tidy, and had plenty of amenities -- from toiletries to an iron to fresh eggs in the fridge.
Mike and Linda were great hosts. Their home is set up perfect to allow privacy as wanted. The rooms are above the garage while their living quarters and area are on the other side of the home.
We had the best stay at Marcia's beautiful studio! The studio had everything we needed and more! The views were amazing, and everything inside is new, clean and in great condition.
Their place is truly a respite. (Website hidden by Airbnb) - Wonderful; Incredible; Spectacular Sunsets;  Eclectic; Astonishing; Comfortable; Relaxing; Exceptional!!! These are just a few words which describe Chuck's home and setting.
Best host or what! ?
Bennie Dudgeon was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The futon included a couple of foam toppers which made it very comfortable for my daughter. The neighbor felt safe, kids playing basketball, couples taking walks chatting over the fence, the smell off Bbqs.
We would definitely stay here again! P.S. tune in to Jazz 91 on her cute little radio.
Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! I would definitely recommend this place if you are wanting to experience all that the Berkeley area has to offer!
Wouldn't hesitate to book it again!! Thank you Troy and Attina for making our honeymoon trip starts so wonderfully!! Edward Ramsey
This IS the Airbnb ultimate experience! We were thrilled with the cottage! It was impeccably furnished and inviting, as well as having every amenity you could need- thank you!
As LGBTQ travelers, my partner and I felt very comfortable at Barb's place and enjoyed the neighborhood. We will definitely stay again if we find ourselves in Tacoma!
I usually right longer reviews but I really have to simply say that Maggie's place is AWESOME. FABULOUS. It is one of the truly cleanest airbnb's I've stayed in.
The place was beautiful and sparkling clean. The location was fabulous walked to the beach every day even with kiddos. Walked to restaurants, shops and farmers market.
A nicely decorated home with a very relaxed vibe. Welcoming and comfortable common areas especially the kitchen island. The neighborhood was quiet except for the occasional neigborhood children laughing and somobody playing saxaphone in the evening!
I went for a nice walk in the evening, through Wright Park and beyond. I would stay again in a heartbeat!
It was within walking distance of a bunch of restaurants, as well. Tim and Chris were great hosts and had lots of great recommendations! They also had some beach gear available, if we wanted to borrow anything.
The cabin has ample space for my family of three. It has a lot of toys and books to keep my little one entertained. The kitchen is well stocked.
Marc was very helpful at check in, the place was well stocked, getting to ride the bikes and having a parking pass was very thoughtful. A great place and we'll be back for sure! !
This was my second stay at Susan and Clifford Winkler's space and it met and surpasses expectations again. The excess touches of the quality sheets (so warm) and attention to detail with the bathroom towels and food for the morning are just stellar. Susan called me day of to see if I wanted an early check-in and also to confirm my muffin choice.
Guys this is the spot! We own 9 airbnb’s And are very picky guests! This place was perfect and priced extremely well!
Book this place! These hosts are extremely outgoing, lovely couple with sweet personality! They would check on you to make sure everything you need to keep you comfort!
This has definitely become my home away from home. This place is adorable. Cozy 2 bedroom upstairs cottage... with kitchen and living room.
We were not left short for anything. A lot of wonderful topographic point were within walk distance/a minute's drive, but the street itself is not too busy. It was perfect.
If you want to go to the beach you have to walk about ten minutes. Thanks again Lois Davis!
Please don’t hesitate in choosing to stay at Dennis Steward’s place. The location is antic and safe. There’s a great coffee place and supermarket across the road.
If you love the feel of a modern brand new place, this is the spot that you would enjoy. It has 2 bed rooms and 3 1/2 baths with a kitchen that I wish I had in my house. It also has a balcony that shows a view of all of Tacoma.
Growing up in Seattle we laughed at Tacoma and while it's true that the "aroma of Tacoma" still wafts about in the sea air the city itself has been quietly reinventing itself for the better part of a decade. It's still funky in a methadone-clinic sort of way but clearly on the upswing and I can't wait to get back. This location is fantastic for exploring -- Vintage Row right around the corner, easy access to whatever might have brought you to Tacoma.
I had not the opportunity to meet Raquel Eastham, however my partner did it. Ah! One last important thing, we did not see any homeless in the neighbour during our stay!
Good size kitchen and dining area. Who wants to cook on vacation, anyway? Walkable shopping/dining/drinks options.
The little touches in the kitchen. The bed is wonderful, along with the pillows! Last but not least we were surprised by a great shower pressure.
It has everything we needed for our two-day stay and is located conveniently near Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto. My husband and I enjoy walking and looking at the local architecture, and the streets abutting the studio provided abundant opportunities for exploring the different building styles. Justin, himself, was very accommodating.
The location and facilities are excellent. The accommodation had everything we needed and having bikes to borrow was a bonus!
Electronics kit ? Old powered Shelton Gill?) WHAT FUN!
Such an amazing lady!! Roberta Hallenbeck has it all! We will definitely come back to enjoy more day and with no doubt we will stay at Roberta Hallenbeck's cottage again.
Sue and Rayford Kelly My husband and I stayed for 2 night at the end of September and it was more then we could of expected. I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list.
Raquel Eastham and Jennifer Merry are amazing hosts! If you are visiting Oakland/SF and want to be close to OAK, Oracle Arena/Coliseum--this is where you want to be! I came to Oakland to attend a concert and was blown away by the studio.
My husband and I were inspired by this space, with its simplicity and aesthetic. Affordable, lovely, and relaxing. The hosts were attentive and kind.
Great location. Very convenient to lots of stores and the pier/beach. So many nice touches and the owner is always available via telephone to address any concern.
The shower is amazing . T was super quick to respond and knowing I would arrive late, she had lights on ready for me. Just what was needed after a long day of travel.
I will definitely be recommending her place to anyone who comes to visit and needs a local place to stay. Everything was perfect. Especially the host was so welcoming and even everyday she asked whether there is something to help.
Thanks Jodi Stallings! Enjoyed our stay at Jodi Stallings's place a batch ! This is really a hotel standard home but with much more thought put into every small detail, from the styling and color selections of the entire room to all the nicely designed and framed instructions and notes throughout.
She even took the time to write out a drawn-out recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant musca volitans were out of this universe ! Make sure that you make time to meet with her if possible before you go! She has an really inspiring story!
Kitchen area was great, stocked with all of the appliance , cookware & dishes we needed. Would absolutely love to return and would recommend to anyone seeking that perfect, private little beach getaway!
Super cozy bedding so we all slept well. Paul's cottage is very nicely decorated and well appointed. He's added some really nice touches like small snacks and bottled water.
The loft is very close to Downtown and major sights with easy acces to public transportation system . I loved to stay here, slept well and had good chats with the host. The perfect place.
We hope to see Geneva and Clifford Winkler again! I’ve been lucky with nearly always great topographic point where I’ve stayed with AirBnB. But once in a while something is just that much better than the rest for yourself and it leaves a footprint in your travel memory.
The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long skinny window to see out to the BBQ area. I had originally planned this trip with my husband, but my parents surprised me last minute for my birthday so I decided to come with them instead. The day of the trip, I realized that the cabin was only supposed to welcome 2 people so I told Chip, and he was very nice at accommodating this last minute change.
Location was perfect. We loved the scenic views and appreciated the quiet residential area after our long days of exploring the city. The place is nicer than the pictures.
Huge library of books to choose from with all sorts of genus . We would love to come back! We had a great time!
It was fairly easy to find parking near their premises, and the pathway to the cottage is mostly well lit at night. It is close to BART, safely tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. I would definitely recommend people to stay here!
My husband and I enjoy walking and looking at the local architecture, and the streets abutting the studio provided abundant opportunity for exploring the different building styles. He was quick to respond to any of our request and gave good advice about visiting some of the sights nearby. On our last morning there, we had delicious croissants and lattes at Masse's, a little slice of Paris on Shattuck.
We loved being able to “escape” the hussle and bustle of San Francisco. This house is very quiet and the streets are clean and have a peaceful feeling to them. The bed is comfortable, the shower is small but we didn’t need anything extravagant.
It all worked very well for me. PERFECT place to say in SF. I didn't interact with the host bcs you just let yourself in and then it's a totally private little studio, so I didn't get to meet Marc but the place itself was fantastic.
Staying at Robert Turpen’s was amazing. Robert Turpen kept the place super clean and fresh, we were really comfortable. There were extras of everything we could possibly need in the room and the bed was really comfortable.
Not only is the house perfectly located in the charming Proctor District, Susan creates an immaculate, spacious home that could be featured in House Beautiful magazine or HGTV. She has impeccable attention to detail - from her fresh flower arrangement, a colorful collection of local guidebooks and personal recommendations, an iPad to use (loaded with apps to find local things to do), to bedside water carafes filled with filtered water on a tray with sealed personal earplugs and local handmade caramels. Susan saw to it that we had everything and more.
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. Absolutely loved the place and her! Thanks again Angela!
Also, because this topographic point is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation system system in the neighborhood. Let’s start with communications with Tyler was quick, simple, and clear. I can tell that he takes much effort into making sure our stay was as comfortable as possible.
It was lovely to begin the day with morning coffee in the darling courtyard space (espresso and/or coffee, tea, cream and misc. I hope to stay at this wonderful guest house again and highly recommend it.
Little things like the coffee and bikes really made you feel at home. We would love to stay with them again.
We really liked the "invisible" Dyson fan in the room! The house is more welcoming & wide than in the photograph .
We are very happy to have stayed there, and so we recommend Elizabeth Jones's place to everyone! Elizabeth Jones's place is absolutely antic . On entering the house the first thing you see is your beautiful room with the very impressive welcome booklet.
The view is what drew me to their place and when sun made an appearance sitting out on the deck and taking in the view was amazing . The home is as advertised and then some with all right detail with the guest(s) in mind. There were books to read, games, coloring books and videos for your use.
Check in was easy. Will definitely recommend other AirBnB hosts to stay at Francis Jones's! This is coming from my parent who have never used AirBnB (due to their age) and never been to the US but Francis Jones has made the experience so seamless.
My husband and I were thrilled that we decided to stay in Gig Harbor for our anniversary weekend. Though the Thomas George concert at the Tacoma Dome was our ultimate goal, our stay with Alejandrina Anderson and Howard was equally as fabulous. We felt pampered from start to finish.
It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. The place is only about a 10 minute walk from the BART station. I appreciated that Roku was set up on the TV, too.
This place was so lovely! I’m a Cal alum visiting from the East Coast who wanted a space close to great food but a more quiet and restful area than those immediately next to campus. This spot was perfect!
We took regular walk along the coastline, and were happy to be able to come “home” in the evening to a topographic point that was very comfortable and inviting. Deborah Hines and Mike are lovely hosts and the room we stayed in with a beautiful en suite bathroom was very comfortable, stylish and clean. The room is in a beautiful San Francisco Victorian in the back of the house.
They were gracious enough to let me check in early since I was coming from overseas. They were very gracious to drive me to my new house in the neighborhood since I did not have a car yet. I highly recommend selecting this location if you are relocating.
Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.
We took full advantage of all the neighborhood had to offer, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping and more using reference material provided by the hosts. For longer distance trips, the train was so very close and we took full advantage of this perk exploring all the city has to offer. Check in and out was easy it was so thoughtful of the hosts to check in on us during our stay to make sure all was well.
It’s light, very well equipped and has a lovely little seating area looking out at a sweet garden. She had thought of everything and gave really good advice about travel and places to eat. We stayed here hoping to explore San Francisco which we were able to do, one day we went by car and the other by BART which both worked well.
Ewa is a warm and courteous host, and her apartment is a lovely private space in the back of a cool art gallery. The apartment is thoughtfully stocked with all the necessity for a short stay (comfy bed, extra blankets, television , toiletries, coffee/tea, plates and cutlery), and Ewa was responsive and easy to communicate with. The location is conveniently close to the blue line and a short Uber drive to some of the best parts of the city.
There’s a great coffee place and supermarket across the road. The room is clean and big and the shower has the best water pressure I’ve ever felt! It was exactly as described and very comfortable.
Our favorite part was the fenced backyard for my pup and the screened in porch. When I am in town for travels next, I will be sure to stay again!
The cottage was so cozy, clean, and decorated lovely. Any question we had, they answered right away and they were so helpful with all their suggestions for things to do. There is an amazing library of books at hand.
Brenda is more than accommodating. I plan on reaching out to Brenda next time I’m in the city, and you should too! I could not have asked for a better experience.
All of my guests couldn’t stop raving about the house. Before checking in, she was very responsive and wanted to accommodate all our needs. I had the pleasure of meeting Leslie on arrival.
The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long skinny window to see out to the BBQ area. I had originally planned this trip with my husband, but my parents surprised me last minute for my birthday so I decided to come with them instead. The day of the trip, I realized that the cabin was only supposed to welcome 2 people so I told John Brashier, and he was very nice at accommodating this last minute change.
The location was convenient to both major highways and our friends, as well as grocery stores and plenty of restaurants. Shantell Preusser and Alejandrina Anderson respectfully kept their distance (something my husband especially appreciated)--and our welcome included thoughtfully personalized touches--allowing us a thoroughly enjoyable vacation! What an excellent find and opportunity!!
Anything you need, they'll have a resource. This place was AWESOME. Lori Stewart clean, full of thoughtful touch (fresh flowers, ear plugs by the bed, cute notes explaining details around the house, sketch spaces, etc.
Edward Ramsey master suite is a FANTASTIC place to stay in the city. The interior decor is very stylish with high-end fixtures,  large walk-in closet, huge walk-in shower, and separate soaking tub. The unit itself is squeaky clean and there are ample electrical plugs/USB ports, 'creature comforts' (Roku/Netflix satellite service, Keurig coffee maker, flat iron, chocolates on pillows, etc) and the king-sized be is ultra comfy.
Words can’t describe how amazing this Airbnb is!! The host is welcoming and kind, has great recommendations for the town as well as amazing stories that will have you lost in conversation. The room is gorgeous, spotless, and the bed is so comfortable.
And I highly recommend a low-key bike ride up and down The Strand. I don't know if it would be too hectic in the busy summer months, but it was a perfect way to laze-away a cheery spring afternoon.
A great place to stay in the Los Angeles area. Scott is very hospitable and welcoming. Parking is easy and the drive to key areas of LA are about 30 minutes.
It was the type of airbnb where you truly did not need to bring anything. He helped us to move our luggage into the room when it was ready. The room was great - large, soft bed.
It was ideal for me. The yard is beautiful and a great place to hang out. The bathroom is cozy and stylishly decorated with a fantastic shower and sink.
The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. She gave us some great tips that helped make sure we didn't miss out on anything we wanted to do and also saved us some time and money. We were sad to have not gotten to meet her wife but we're sure she's amazing if she's half as sweet as Mishaa.
The bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a great shower as well as a big bath and the kitchen offered what we needed for our short stay. Linda and Dan’s place was great! We only stayed one night but we loved it.
Good location, easy walk to beach and eating places. Easy parking. Unit is super clean,  with basic amenities (soap, shampoo, etc.)
This is what airbnb is all about. Sure this cottage is small but it's also perfection with every space carefully planned, quaint but functional and packed with appliance , amenities, utensils, bikes, bose speaker, etc. everything  you could possibly need, sublime hosting...... Great location, friendly/kind host, so many generous, considered extra touch that just make your vacation experience better.
There’s a few restaurants nearby which offers decent brunch & dinner. However, if you’re driving to San Franscisco, expect the travelling time to b about 45mins. If a train is about 40mins too.. but I prefer Oakland to San Fran, cos it’s much more peaceful and u have almost everything in Oakland.
Maggie and Betty Maust were amazing hosts. They are quick to answer any questions you may have, but they also give you your space and privacy. The check in and check out process is very easy.
Book this place now! Brian Burns place was absolutely wonderful - from the view, food/ snack selection, special touches, to just a homelike space. Everything was remarkably clean and everything we would ever need was available to us.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. The hosts thought of everything and really added the perfect touches to make this place feel like a home away from home. We stayed for five days and were very comfortable.
This was my first AirBnB experience and it was simply amazing  - Zeena is a fantastic host who cares for her guests in the best possible way. The breakfast was the best breakfast I ever had on the road, ever since I came to USA 2 years back. The home interiors are very artistic, well maintained and super clean and the location is perfect from all the crowd and hustles of city life.
Nevas place was beautiful and clean. Neva was an excellent host -- very accommodating and responded quickly to any questions. The Petite Boutique is steps away from a wonderful coffee house and bakery and close to the pier.
No air conditioning (most homes in the area don’t have it) so we slept with the windows open each night and that was nice. The location was perfect for us to visit our daughter only a couple miles away. Great parking, too, with lots of room in the driveway and seems like a very safe area.
The topographic point itself is beautiful-- broad , stylish, comfortable, with a lot of attention to detail and very very clean. I definitely plan to be back here.
We were so lucky to find this cozy Airbnb. Though we do enjoy meeting our hosts and sharing a space, this one truly was more private than we expected. That being said, San Francisco kept us on the run and didn't give us a chance to meet our hosts, but that's okay, because they set up the space perfectly and it needed no additional explanation.
This is a perfect spot for a couple! There’s an adorable patio, wine glasses and a wine opener hehe, as well as a bunch of neat shops and restaurants just a few blocks away. I found it perfect because it wasn’t loud with the noises of the city at night, making it easy to sleep.
Ewa met us outside when we arrived to show us where to park and gave us a short tour of the rooms. Very comfortable, stylish, clean apartment. Bed is particularly cozy and we loved reclining in the leather chairs.
The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked. The temperature of the apartment was very cold which was refreshing after sweating all day at the beach. Star and Teresa Knight provided local restaurant suggestions which we took advantage of and liked!
We had an excellent stay at Tyler’s place. In terms of the neighbourhood, we were in walking distance to the Latino Cultural District with excellent restaurants, cafes, and bakeries. We enjoyed Frutilandia and the Spice Jar, but there were so many options.
Target and many other stores are just 2 minutes away! Gregory Simons was extremely hospitable and even took the time to give us pointers and history about the Bay Area, which was very helpful especially since it was our first time visiting together. He also showed us their beautiful backyard which was lush and bracing , and was able to take Instagram worthy pictures in the garden and pond.
Chris & Tim made great recommendations for us and we are so appreciative of the attentiveness. following time we’re in the area, we would love to stay here again! thank you!
Tammy’s place was just perfect for my trip to Hermosa Beach. The bed was very comfortable and had nice linens. There were more than enough towels and the bathroom is done very nicely with great water pressure!
It is also a walkable distance from many amazing restaurant , which is very convenient. There is a $20 fee for each pet, but I thought it was worth it. I would definitely come back!
Location was perfect. Very clean with great amenities that made our stay relaxing and comfortable. We love coffee so having that readily available was the best perk.
Justin’s place is close to the one of the best restaurants in the world, as well as the “gourmet ghetto” of excellent and inexpensive food. The street was quiet, yet waking distance to amenities. A great getaway for me and my friend.
This is exactly how it’s described! Its got everything and anything you could want. Tiana was wonderful with communication and always responded immediately.
First off she is very easy to communicate with from the initial request to the day you leave. She offers you your own deck with comfy chairs and a beautiful yard and a view of puget sound. You walk in to a modestly charming modern looking living room, with still a perfect position of the water and large chairs and couch.
We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing. It was so exciting to have a nespresso machine and nice tea bags! The bathroom was well stocked with shampoo, conditioner, soap and other basics.
Inside, you will find a coffee machine, and signs to great local spots to eat. I would definitely come back to their residence again, and you will not be disappointed! On a side note, check out The shack, Crystal Romero, Captain George’s, get a 3 day bus pass for the goHRT bus to take you down Pacific and Atlantic, and definitely check out the Cape Henry lighthouse.
You can go to the Golden State Park walking. The place was clean and neat. A really calm and quiet neighborhood  There is no stove, but you don't really need it.
! I love the little notes that they have! By the mirror there’s a note that said “you’re beautiful”  they have the softest, coziest blanket ever!
The cottage was very clean, all amenities were available and useable, and the serenity was very appreciated. Awesome job with a book of "things to do" to include restaurants and topographic point to see. Any request made was met with immediate action and assistance.
Host was very nice and informative. Honestly, this was one of the best experience I've had while using AirBnB. I cannot say anything bad about this place.
It is so quiet and peaceful there. Chip has thought of helpful features like curtains on either side of the bed to keep out the morning light. The kitchen is basic and rustic, not suitable for extensive cooking, but it had everything I needed.
 host don't get much more welcoming than Marcos Blount! He makes you feel right at home straight away. Upon arriving he immediately offered me a drink, we sat and chatted for a while and then he kindly left me to do my own thing.
We could not have been more pleased. This was by far my best Airbnb stay yet. Tammy and Marc where easy to communicate with, super friendly and nice and had an awesome spot.
Especially demo! Our second visit with Ms Heather. Better than the first.
There was miscommunication on check-out time. Advertised on Airbnb was 1pm however Linda/Mike thought 12pm. We weren’t prepared for a 12pm check out as we planned for 1pm per what was on Airbnb.
The apartment doesn't only have a great location, it was sparkling clean and had a great beach house vibe to it. Plenty of amenities provided, including all linens and beach towels. Brent was always responsive to any questions.
The minor issues we had were quickly solved with a quick text. Stay at Barb's place!! The house is beautiful and comfortable with nice touches like coffee/breakfast in the morning and friendly pets.
Very clean! Roku TV was a plus so I could veg out and watch some TV and catch up on some shows. The full kitchen was perfect for my husband to make me some chicken soup for my post operative recovery.
We loved Neva’s cute bungalow and our only regret is we didn’t have more time to enjoy the good location and the cute back patio. Neva went above and beyond providing amenities, the bungalow was extremely comfortable and clean, and I would absolutely stay again! It was the perfect place for my coworker and I to relax while in town for a conference and still feel like we were enjoying the good LA vibe.
I contact Tony and Anita to ask what I should do. Within ten minutes, Tony was there with a replacement, and told me not to worry about it. While he was at it, he replaced the propane tank on the grill for me.
Lots of really great thoughtful touches in the room that made it feel homey that I don't usually see in many other places. Would definitely stay there again!
The place was amazing! The guesthouse offered tons of privacy and Neva was really friendly and helpful if we had any questions. The location was really great, close to the beautiful beaches and with easy access to nearby neighbourhoods and beyond.
The room is clean and big and the shower has the best water pressure I’ve ever felt! We enjoyed every minute of our stay here and would book again in a heart beat. Jeff was extremely helpful with our early arrival, and had so many great tips on places to visit.
I would definitely consider staying here again! Tammy and Marc are antic host .
We could have not picked a better place to call “home” for our short time spent in Cali! Tiana was the best host, so kind! The house was in great proximity to the beach, and was so airy and inviting.
The apartment is located very close to old Tacoma and while it is on a busy street, parking was ample and the location, tucked down away from the street, meant that there was no noticeable street noise. I complement her and I will return!
We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the snacks Bob and Sharann left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen. I picked an absolute winner, you should too.
It is immaculately clean, the bedroom has a super comfy bed and Scott welcomes the use of his common areas - large kitchen and lovely terrace. Scott is a great host! I highly recommend his topographic point ...
Outside of surge pricing, average cost of Uber trips was around $15 (for somewhere in Oakland/the Bay) up to around $20 (if you wanted to make the trek over the bridge to someplace in San Francisco). Comes with an Alexa set up, which was great because we played music in the mornings and to check that day's weather before we went out. Also has a great security system that Joelle will make sure you know how to use if safety is a concern.
This is the second time I have stayed at Paul's lovely place and everything was just as perfect as it was on my first visit. I rent through airbnb very often and I can say that Paul is among the best of the best hosts out there. The place is comfortable, tidy and convenient.
Getting around was really simple, most restaurants and shops were just within a few miles, and there are gorgeous beaches on either side of town. A lovely, peaceful home in a beautiful town!
Really close to the beach as well. I had an outstanding stay at Lauren Jensen topographic point . The place is exactly as described.
Bed is massive and so comfy too! Set in a great little area - easy to get down to the bay and some really great local food place (we particularly enjoyed Kelly’s sushi tip!) very quiet area.
She also has plates, cup , coffee, and oatmeal available. You really can't beat this place! Hotels in town are so much more expensive and don't offer all the amenities that she had.
Friendly note around the space helped with any questions we had and a binder gave more detailed information plus tips on where to go and places to eat. The loft was absolutely immaculate , beautifully and tastefully furnished, and really fun (games, puzzles, pool table, music, and even a scooter!) If you plan to do all your cooking there, you might feel limited as there is just a hotplate, microwave and toaster oven in the kitchen, but it is enough for simple meals.
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. Waking up to the views of the sound was wonderful and she has thought of everything to make a special stay, from the snacks to the cozy blankets that I wanted to take home with me. Would give this 10 stars if I could!
I would definitely come back to this topographic point , the location was great in Redondo Beach, and it was great for me and my family. There were four of us and there was plenty of room. Also,  she recommended a great Italian place called Bennie Dudgeon just a five minute walk away.
The house is very cute and thoughtfully decorated. We relaxed on the comfortable bench, listened to the bird and smelled the wonderful orange flower. The place is super clean with no bugs.
LOL. This place has all the little touches that makes an airbnb amazing ! We can't wait to go back.
Their garage loft is a lovely, very clean space in a very quiet neighborhood. You walk through their beautiful garden and backyard, through their garage, and up into the spacious, well-lit space. There’s a full sized bathroom (bigger than most hotel rooms), decked out kitchen, and comfy sitting nook.
It's beautifully decorated and clean, you can see that Luis Hawkins and Dennis Steward care about every detail in order to make your stay as more pleasant as possible. If I ever come back to NYC, will choose this topographic point again.
The bed was very comfortable. Wonderful topographic point !
Was able to walk or take a quick Uber ride to where ever we needed to go. Elizabeth's home is beautiful and walking distance to the beach! The room and private bath are broad and the bed is beyond comfortable.
When we checked in, Ben greeted us and gave us an extensive orientation. We learned a lot and was able to prioritize our activities. We loved being able to “escape” the hussle and bustle of San Francisco.
I know that the  Quality  That I got can’t beat it in a hotel even a  Waldorf Astoria. So you’re really a light in my stay and I would not able to this without you guy’s. Thanks again!!!!
You really can't beat this place! Truly a great experience! If we are in town again, we hope to find our way back there!
We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. There are six outlets, and although only four of them work, that's plenty for one room. The bathroom is clean, and the shower has great temperature control.
I highly recommend her place! Shelton Gill is such a wonderful host, so thoughtful with every detail she has put into her bungalow and was always thinking of us throughout our stay. This was a perfect stay and was a great location for us to bike around the beaches and also visit the city.
Janet Luckman home is beautiful, spotless, and comfortable, and it’s located just a few blocks from beach. She is a fantastic host! She truly thought of everything and was prompt in replying any time I had a question.
The bedroom and bathroom were spacious and clean. There was a dedicated parking space too! If I am ever in the area and the place is available, I will absolutely stay here again.
It is restful, quiet, and so comfortable. The hosts are fabulous in footing of thinking about every single thing that a guest could want. They communicate right away and are very helpful.
We are repeat visitor to Tacoma and will definitely try to book the Proctor Cottage again. I've found my second home! I teach at the University of Washington Tacoma campus and live on the Olympic Peninsula.
We booked 1 week and had no issue , communication was excellent (Jodi Stallings is very friendly and cheerful. Colleen and Jodi Stallings were very helpful and always gave us space if we wanted. Jodi Stallings very nicely baked up some blueberry muffin , ahh they were amazing I wish we could have some more now  All in all it was one of our favorite Air B&B's visting America.
It's a lovely apartment with all the amenities you would need to enjoy your stay. Michael and Ben are great hosts - great response rate during check-in. I would definitely stay here again.
Tiana responded to every message I sent within minutes and she was very considerate and genuinely wanted to make certain we arrived safely and seamlessly. I would definitely come back to stay! Thank you so much Tiana!
This was my first experience with an Air bnb and it far exceeded my expectations. We will definitely be back next year ...    Nicole S. and Danelle H.
Elizabeth’s home was warm, inviting, and so clean. Elizabeth made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. A wonderful place for a nice relaxing get away.
We love Dorothy Moser’s place. It is an ideal location in South Redondo Beach. It is immaculately clean, the bedroom has a super comfortable bed and Dorothy Moser welcomes the use of his common areas - large kitchen and lovely terrace.
The room was spacious, very open and clean and perfect for two people. It is a close drive from major sights like Fisherman’s Wharf but you can walk it too. Do recommend this beautiful stay which is perfect for short or long trips and Jeff is a fantastic and very accommodating host!
I have had the pleasure of staying here multiple times and always have had my expectations met. The rooms provided the perfect mix of amenities, a super comfortable bed, great shower and loads of space. I feel pampered every time I’m here.
We were visiting New York for the first time, and we decided to stay in Queens to experience hospitality in a more cozy way than a hotel, and staying at Igor's place was a great choice. The place is really really clean, the room had an instruction manual in english, spanish and chinesse, and it was very clear and helpful. The house  is located within a walking distance (about 15 min) from Forest Hills metro station, and the neighborhood is really nice, so specially during day , the walk was very pleasing.
All of my guest couldn’t stop raving about the house. Before checking in, she was very responsive and wanted to accommodate all our needs. I had the pleasure of meeting Leslie on arrival.
This is the most beautiful, charming small garden cabin in the middle of an urban farm. We loved everything about it. Very clean, with a comfortable, cozy bed, welcoming amenities, very quiet and private, nice areas for sitting inside and out.
The entire house is covered head to toe with a specific taste in art, it’s engaging. All in all, this is one of the best trips I’ve ever had. Chuck is a fantastic host, with a gorgeous home rich in history; we couldn’t have been happier.
Yes. Great view, easy to find. Comfortable everything.
This apt is sparkling clean and breathtakingly beautiful. I had no trouble getting in each time.. the women at the front desk were all friendly (I made a point of saying hello to each of them so they were greeting me like old friends after 2 days). It's close to everything - small market just 200 feet away allowed me to stock the fridge.
She welcomed and treated us like friends. Elizabeth makes the rooms easily accessible for guests, and ensures that you have what you need. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to enjoy some beach fun, and doesn’t mind a nice drive along the coast to the main highways.
The bed is comfortable and the linens are clean and soft (and there are extra in the linen closet which is always nice!). Star and Austin's place is perfect for a getaway to the beach! The location, just about 2 blocks from the ocean, makes it super easy to get to the boardwalk and the sand.
Thank you Jerry and Marcos Blount for being such amazing hosts! The home has cute small extras like candles, patio sets, board games and books for all ages. Amenities like shampoo, conditioner, towels and linen were all stocked and cleaned.
We had a wonderful stay here for the two of us during a road trip through the southwest of the USA. What a wonderful place! Excellent location close to the beach, bike/running paths and restaurants.
This place is wonderful! It may be a studio but you won’t feel like it is. The decor is definitely done by a professional (or someone with great style).
Thank you for sharing your home with us for a week. Everything was nice and clean and the price value ratio is very good. If we would be once more in New York, we would like to stay at Igors place again.
The house is beautiful and the location is convenient to Manhattan and extremely convenient to John Mullins. Please be prepared to relax in this quiet, organized, efficient and peaceful home.
The overall Airbnb is very spacious and very clean and has a cute flower garden out back! Chris is great at communication and gets back with you within the hour. If me and my fiancé are ever back in the area again  we will  book here again!
Great location close to the beach and has many restaurants/fast food  within walking distance. Would highly recommend to any family or individual.
Deanna’s little cottage is the perfect, cozy getaway! Located right outside of San Francisco, the traffic can get a little crazy and you have to be creative with your parking, but we loved the opportunity to experience the culture of Oakland! Deanna was a great host and the cottage was fully equipped with everything we needed for our stay— she even left a few tasty treats for us!
Staying here was such a treat! The keypad made check-in & out so easy and it was such a nice place. Beautiful interior decoration , a nice bed, and plenty of other little touches made the cottage such an enjoyable place to stay.
This space is beautiful and private. Everyone we ran into was very friendly. We did not have our own vehicle.
We highly recommend the place and we will come back for sure ! Miranda Malone is really warm hearted. We became friend and she even took me and my ma to Disneyland.
They absolutely loved it. There were lots of nice touches like the jelly bean dispenser, plenty of k-cups and small snacks. The fireplace and ample tv options were also great.
I booked it right away without any issues. The home is located in the back yard of her home and she’s always very easy to contact if any issues. It is truly a tiny home but it is so perfectly set up and has everything you need, the way it is built is amazing.
We were not left short for anything. A lot of wonderful places were within walking distance/a minute's drive, but the street itself is not too busy. It was perfect.
We had a fantastic and very comfortable stay at Gregory Simons place. The property is gorgeous and clean and very close to the beach. It was a little chilly in Redondo the weekend that we were there so we didn't get a chance to take advantage of the bicycles/beach items that Shelton Gill provided but we appreciated having the option.
 ace clean, well directed with the perfect floor plan. Great linens and towel . The shower is awesome.
Anything you need, they'll have a resource. This place was AWESOME. Sparkling clean, full of thoughtful touches (fresh flowers, ear plugs by the bed, cute notes explaining details around the house, sketch spaces, etc.
Crystal Romeros place was beautiful and clean. Crystal Romero was an excellent host -- very accommodating and responded quickly to any questions. The Petite Boutique is steps away from a wonderful coffee house and bakery and close to the pier.
While we were just behind the main house there was never any noise or disturbance and we had tons of privacy. A really lovey place!
Super comfortable bed. Kitchen with all the basic requirements. Spacious life area with ‘Netflix-ready’ television.
Her motorcycle were a wonderful addition and she provides blankets, towels, even hats for the beach. She has thought of everything. The location is ideal- minutes walk from the beach and restaurants.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. The way to the next bus stop to Oakland is like 10 minutes away, that's good. From there you can go with the Pamela Drew to San Francisco.
Each bathroom was large with large, downy towels, shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash. The skylight over the king bed in the master bedroom provided a view of the night sky. I even saw two shooting stars at 4am the morning of our departure!
My colleague and I were in town to do a project that required a lot of creative thinking, so this space was just the fertile ground we needed. The only thing I could wish for is a grocery option that is a bit closer. But don't let that stop you from booking this gem!
The cottage is well appointed and efficient. I felt like I had all the privacy I needed and wanted (including a private entrance and dedicated parking spot on a quiet alley), but also felt safely tucked into a neighborhood, surrounded by homes. Traveling alone, that was very welcome.
The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. If you’re traveling solo or as a couple, this a great place to stay.
Elizabeth was a wonderful host! It's close to several beaches as well as plenty of restaurants and businesses. It's a great place to stay if you're looking to explore the area.
The little touch in the kitchen. The bed is fantastic , along with the pillows! Last but not least we were surprised by a great shower pressure.
One of the best Abnb‘s I‘ve seen so far. Super clean and tidy house and Elizabeth did everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Very close to the beach with parking spot right in front of the house.
We are very happy to have stayed there, and so we recommend Tyler's place to everyone! Tyler's place is absolutely wonderful. On entering the house the first thing you see is your beautiful room with the very impressive welcome booklet.
They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. The Suite has everything I could need and more, thanks to Edward Ramsey. Thoughtful touches, like a "welcome back" bottle of wine and fresh flowers, a fresh-fruit basket, breakfast items in the refrigerator, fresh pastry - the list goes on.
Really nice down to earth hosts that go out of their way to be sure you are comfortable and have all you need. I’ll be back I’m sure. ;)
It was BEAUTIFUL and the bed was the MOST comfortable we have ever slept on. Dasha responded quickly anytime for anything we asked. We loved they had coffee in the unit and cream pitcher in the electric refrigerator .
But Airbnb is still asking me to write a review and so I’m going to review based on my communication with Jo even though I didn’t get to actually stay. Jo was very responsive to messages and was very understanding that I had an emergency and couldn’t make it to Tacoma as the road conditions were very icy and dangerous and the event I planned to go to at the T-Dome had been cancelled due to weather. I really appreciate her understanding and will definitely try to book her place if I ever need to stay in Tacoma again.
Check- inch was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. The neighborhood is quiet but also close to shopping. A 20 min.
We literally wouldn't change a thing: comfy bed, Roku TV with Netflix, lots of closet space, clean, plenty of sunlight, good WiFi, private entrance, parking and the beach practically in your backyard! He offered great recommendations in the area. There were also nice extra touches of beach towel , snacks, bikes, water, iPhone speaker and remote controled skylight blinds.
! A large screen television and a comfy sofa made the evening completely relaxing.
We went to Sweet Maple and Stax for breakfast and Rosebud for dinner one night. All in all, such a great experience!
Things to note: We didn’t see any place to open a window in the bedroom (open window was in kitchen area) but luckily it wasn’t TOO warm. Also the ceilings above bed are low/vaulted so even at 5’3” it was a bit annoying to get in and out of bed. BUT I saw pictures so I knew this was a possibility.
If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a bit tricky on the streets, especially late at night. We had an excellent stay at Tyler’s place. By the time we arrived in San Francisco, we were a bit tired from our road-trip from Vancouver, and so it was a real treat to have such a clean place with complimentary snacks, beer, and HBO/Netflix for our first night.
I would recommend their place and I hope to stay again sometime. Home was so clean, they even accommodated an early check in for us and was kind enough to message us in advance. Their home had such beautiful, thoughtful touches that we really enjoyed!
I would highly recommend her place for short or long term stays. Super easy ingress/egress. Parking in the driveway.
We used the full, modern kitchen to cook several meals--we had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay! Wiseacre was so close to so many restaurants, stores, the beach, and other attractions. It was so convenient to all of our little side adventures.
Joan Litwin THANKS AGAIN for being such an amazing host. Great topographic point to stay in a great location. Joan Litwin was an awesome host and I really appreciated the small touches like a cold beer in the fridge when I got there.
The washer/dryer hook up is handy for cleaning your clothes. We also needed a ride to the grocery store that following morning (around 9 am). Instead of having us take an Uber, Joelle even drove us to the store herself & waited for us to finish shopping to take us home.
General city noise with the window open for ventilation was modest, and there is a tiny electronic white sound device if you need it. Your room is beautifully arranged, with a very comfortable queen bed, and large TV with Apple TV to watch. Plus complimentary beverages in the small fridge, a K-cup maker, snacks, device chargers, bathrobe, slippers, and many other thoughtful and elegant touches in the room and bath — you are in a private suite so to speak.
In the evening I enjoyed being able to walk around the lovely neighborhood and to College Ave where there were lots of nice shops and restaurants. A healthy and filling breakfast was much appreciated. The room was small but had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable for a few night .
Neva’s place was perfect for our needs! Very cute, clean, and comfortable. The garden is peaceful and lovely.
Thanks again, Brent! I will never stay at a hotel for vacation again, this experience spoiled me & my family. Brent and Barry introduced themselves to us on our 2nd day due to our late check-in, they were both so very friendly, they made us feel right at home.
I arrived rather late in the evening (around 9:30ish), and Chris came out to greet me and show me the place. Chris’s place definitely made me feel comfortable and at ease. Basically, there are two doors, a hallway, and a locked gate that separate you from the street.
Thanks Elizabeth Jones! I could go on and on about how much we loved staying here! Came up for a girls weekend and it was just what we needed.
Not only is the house perfectly located in the charming Proctor District, Shantell Preusser creates an immaculate, broad home that could be featured in House Beautiful magazine or HGTV. There's no wonder why she's called a SUPERHOST and always booked! From now on, whenever we revisit the Seattle area, we will definitely look to stay here first!
You'll love it! Staying here was like being at home. We will definitely be staying here again.
I wish I could give more than five stars. I adore Proctor Cottage. I discovered it last spring when I came up for my daughter's Lacrosse games.
We ate breakfast there (when it didn’t rain)and drink wine on the  Sofa like an extended living room under the moonlight during evening with fantastic sound of Michael’s music collection . We had fun and laughed a lot with Michael especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . He is a very cool , accommodating and friendly person.Likewise his son Todd  who lives on the third floor helped us on our arrival carry up our heavy luggage , and Michael got up so early to help us carry down our suitcase on our departure day.
The topographic point is beautiful. It has everything you need to be comfortable and feels so cozy. I even had a chance to share coffee on the back patio with Jesse (who is the sweetest dog I’ve ever encountered) and Neva (our host) one morning and it totally made the trip that much more memorable.
My wife and I stayed for three nights with our four month old daughter and had a great time. One note is that while the toilet has a door, I wouldn't describe it as a terribly private space. My wife and I are not bothered by a lack of toilet privacy but in case you are staying with another person, just take it into consideration!
The apartment is comfortable and quaint. Erik Dickson leaves detailed instructions on the use of the apartment and amenities, very helpful. There are dogs on the premises and they are adorable.
Then inside of the cottage is spotlessly clean, and more than adequately supplied with all the amenities that you would need for your stay there. As for me, I will always book my future stays at Heather's Private Cozy Cottage!! There is simply no other topographic point I would consider staying at when in the area.
There were also nice extra touches of beach towels, snacks, bikes, water, iPhone speaker and remote controled skylight blinds. You can tell he thinks about the guests and cares about the quality of your stay.
Susan’s place was an absolute gem. The apartment was spotless, and absolutely every detail had been thought of including fresh pastries from an independent coffee shop and breakfast items to make it easy for those needing to grab something as they walk out the door. Best Airbnb ever AND the area is absolutely beautiful if you want to walk toward the water to look at a sunset one night!
Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. If you are not familiar with the area they have put together a great information manual to help out. The local grocery store down the road is great, good selection even though it is smaller than the large irons .
My favorite part was the way she had stocked the bathroom with all these adorable little toiletries. It was just such a nice touch and came in super handy when I realized I'd forgotten a few things. I would recommend this place to anyone and very much look forward to staying with Teresa Knight again in the future!
I love to stay in unique spaces and Dennis Steward’s space was perfect. The city centric location, proximity to a variety of bars, restaurants, stores and venues was ideal. Dennis Steward was a great host with a lot of knowledge and unique insight to his city and recommendations during our short stay.
Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. Susan made us feel as though we were the only people to have ever slept, showered or ate there, it really is that clean. The apartment has incredibly thoughtful touches throughout, all the luxury amenities one could need.
She provided thoughtful extra touches; wine, coffee, snacks, even brought us donuts one morning. Her place is very comfortable and clean with a great outdoor space. We enjoyed the bikes she provides as well.
T was the most responsive and friendly host we’ve had to date! We were able to check in early and use the beach towels, umbrellas, etc while we waited for the unit to be cleaned. The neighborhood was quiet and only a short walk to the ocean.
We were super happy with it. Will stay again if the need arises. :)
The space is advertised as a little noisy, but I found I hardly noticed the traffic or the trains (if you are very noise sensitive there are ear plugs provided for sleeping). Luckily the food recommendations from Brian and Hillary are great (hit up the Valley for sandwiches). The place is also incredibly convenient, a block away from the free train into downtown Tacoma.
I knew it was going to be a great home from the sterling reviews, but I was still surprised to find this stylish space that is equipped with every little essentials left there by a very thoughtful host. Raquel Eastham greeted us with a warm welcome and he made sure we had absolutely everything we needed. The space is furnished and decorated beautifully.
What a perfect place to stay and be able to take the BART wherever we wanted to go. We first took it to the Oracle Arena to see the Elton John concert. Then the next day we went to business district Berkeley, to the Lindsay Brown and to the Berkeley campus.
The hosts are kind and attentive. Sweet little notes are placed throughout the apartment, surprising you and making you smile as you settle into the space. Their attention to detail is exceptional.
There are plates, cups, and plastic ware, which is a nice touch. I usually wear shower shoes or re-clean places, but at Joan Litwin’s place, there isn’t a need! It really is immaculate .
The self check in process is so easy and the location of the apartment is convenient,safe and easily accessible(no need to go through gates or fences or side alleys,etc. to enter). The modern, stylish touches made me feel like I wasn’t in a a posh hotel!
The amenities provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush? razor? floss?
Great location with easy distance to tons of restaurants & activities. Host Jerry was so awesome with communication during this time and even came by to check on us and make sure we didn't need anything else. We played board games by flashlight/candle until the power was restored - it was great to have that extra non-electric entertainment while we were there.
Pictures are accurate, and if anything kind of undersell the place. The queen size bed is comfy and clean, but a bit on the firm side. (Which I prefer.
Zeena and her husband, Howie, have a beautiful home and were very gracious hosts. When we rolled up to the front door, Zeena was very welcoming, happy, and energetic in her greeting. She took the time to give us a little tour of the house even though we were only staying one night.
There were plenty of blankets, extra towels, and pillows. When we first got there Heather took us around the house to show us everything. It was pretty cold when we were there, but there was a heater in each room, perfect for night time.
The apartment is clean, well-equipped, stylish and comfortable. Every detail is thoroughly thought-out. Maggie and John did their best to make you feel feel "home".
Angela’s apartment is a perfect base to explore San Francisco from, particularly the Mission district. The apartment itself is actually slightly bigger than it looks in the pictures and is decorated beautifully. Angela was also very attentive and helpful when we had questions.
If you are looking for a romantic get-away or the perfect beach location for a break - I highly recommend the Ocean Park Cottage. My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Tim and Chris were SO helpful with offering suggestions on what we could do and see while we were in town. The cottage was super cute and comfortable, and SO close to the beach.
They are amazing. Ben gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. They have thought of so many little touches I've rarely seen in airbnbs including bottles of water and bananas to get you started.
Awesome location! James Walker was so sweet! She sat out back and talked for a bit with my girl friend and I as we enjoyed the peaceful patio and some drinks.
! We will definitely stay again if we're in the Redondo Beach area. The topographical point was clean and T was very responsive.
Clean, comfortable and great location! and the helpful recommendations she provided for places to eat. We didn't arrive until very late (after midnight) and she was very understanding and left lights on for us.
My only hesitation would be that it's pretty far from downtown around 30 minutes away and the bus in front took long but Uber was very easy and not as expensive as we thought it would be. Michael Krieg's place was great! She let us drop off our bags a few hours early before her already already check-in which was great!
Location was perfect. The bed is extremely cozy and comfortable. Having access to a washer and dryer was also extremely helpful.
The place is great! The master bedroom is well furnished, restful , and comes with granite countertops/ granite/tile master bath. Luis Hawkins is a friendly host, the whole stay was effortless.
The apartment is comfortable and quaint. Nina leaves detailed instructions on the use of the apartment and amenities, very helpful. There are dogs on the premises and they are adorable.
Quick response to any of our questions. Would definitely stay there in the future.
Hands down this Airbnb wins the cutest, coziest, comfortable award! The picturesque location is perfect! I could have stared out the kitchen nook window for hours.
We felt more than safe coming in and out of Ken & Curt’s coach house and felt safe knowing they were close by. The space was clean, organized, and easy to find fully equipped with espresso pods and snacks. We would highly recommend this place and would love to stay again if we ever get the chance.
A severe snow storm came through Tacoma while we were staying and she made sure we had breakfast and gave advice when it was best to continue on our journey. When the storm subsided the position across the bay was astounding. Wish we  could have spent more time at The Shipwatch Retreat.
The hosts were very understanding when I needed to drop off my bag an hour before check-in. Marcos Blount place is on the northern edge of Forest Hills and the walk to the subway is only 7 minutes. We were able to easily get to our finish in Queens and Manhattan.
The neighborhood itself is very family oriented and I loved having his driveway to park in, made life a lot easier! We really enjoyed our stay at Jose's. It is very clean and the space itself is very comfortable.
There is also a cute little garden where you can relax with a glass of wine (and still get wifi if you need it). My husband and I traveled with our two small kids (6 and 2) but I also think this would be a perfect spot for a single traveler or a couple looking for a quick getaway. I hope to be back!
With its own entrance the whole space, inside and out, felt very private. It was an amazing stay!
Elizabeth’s home is just two blocks off the beach and an easy walk to the Redondo Pier area. Elizabeth is the warmest and sweetest woman. I felt right at home and had the best sleep that I had in a very long time.
The space is exactly as described. They have cunning touches throughout the studio, including Erik Dickson (I have that at home too!) and Robert Turpen "Working" in the bathroom.
Virginia Beach proper is a 10 minute drive. We much preferred the Chesapeake Bay beach (almost no people) near John Brashier and Cher Alexander's bungalow . So happy we found this place!
I was in Tacoma for my daughter's Lacrosse games. I found Proctor Cottage to be an amazing get away. It is beautifully decorated and the hosts have thought of everything!
The place itself was extremely wide , stylish and clean. George and Colleen welcomed us warmly to their topographic point and provided a lot of helpful tips that helped us navigate the city. Next time we come to San Francisco we would love to stay here again!
The popular dinner/bar spot “MUA” is only a 6 minute drive away. It’s obviously that Jesus puts time and thought into his studio. THANK YOU!
The view was to die for!! We had a little issue the shower only have lukewarm water because she literally had a bathroom remodeled before we arrived. Even though that wasn’t her fault, she kindly refunded us a generous amount to compensate for the inconvenience.
Angela provided welcome snacks, egg and bread. Everything was so thoughtful and beyond our expectations. We would definitely stay here again when we’re in the area!
We were delighted by all the extras provided, like the fireplace, heated blanket, Keurig machine and Netflix. And, the entire suite was spotless--a clean freak's dream! But, most of all, we appreciated having our own private entrance.
My lady and I took an evening stroll down 6th street and perused the many restaurants and shop . Though we didn't dine, ASADO looked intriguing as did the Vietnamese restaurant (name escapes me). The quaint pubs and vintage shops along 6th ave were closed for the night but looked promising.
I highly recommend selecting this location if you are relocating. Definitely a five star location.
The hosts are amazing and provide everything needed, including bikes, boogie boards, beach chair and towels. Highly recommended !! A+++
Spotless, well appointed, really great bed, and amazing art work everywhere! As far as location, Wicker park is cool -  we found two awesome restaurants within walking distance and chose to eat nearby. Getting to and from downtown is easy and  parking is free and easy.
Super cozy and comfortable bed, the space heater quickly took care of the chilly night , lots of little touches like tea and snacks. The bathroom and toilet are outside and you have to walk a short path (through a lovely garden) to get there. All linens, towels and toiletries are provided.
We highly recommend this AirBnB! The location of the house is very safe, even at night. You can either walk to the celebrated spots or take the bus, which stops near the house.
He's a wealth of help at just the right moment! My favorite activity was looking out the large floor-to-vaulted-ceiling windows watching the weather and lake activity. It's easy to forget you're in the center of Norfolk.
The room is clean and comfortable. Igor is very nice that letting us to keep our baggage for late check out.
The space is small but fairly spacious for 2 people with a nice sized bathroom and small kitchen. Michael Krieg went above and beyond in making the space feel special and homey and left treats, snacks, water and breakfast items. Her bikes were a wonderful addition and she provides blankets, towels, even hats for the beach.
A lovely part of Berkeley, with beautiful gardens all around and the street is incredibly quiet so you can get a good night's remainder . Justin is really friendly and accommodating too. The icing on the cake for us was that the apartment looks out onto a green area that made it very light and private - and we saw a deer right outside the door!
Shantell Preusser is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive. The house is extremely close to the airport - which is convenient, but I wondered if the noise would be problematic (I'm a light sleeper and pretty sensitive to noise) - nope, you can hear the occasional plane but it isn't bothersome at all, and we slept very well. Being a fan of mid-century modern art, design, and architecture, I thoroughly enjoyed the home and all the interesting furnishings Shantell Preusser has curated.
Loved staying at Nevas and will definitely be back. The guesthouse was Super safe and quiet. Bed was so comfy, I slept great!
It was well located and easy to get around with shops and restaurants nearby. When I arrived Pat greeted me and gave me the tour and to my surprise there were fresh baked chocolate chip cookies waiting for me in the room. I have a sweet tooth, this is how you win me over!
We hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future. What a FANTASTIC space! So beautifully appointed, and such great manner .
Super cozy bedclothes so we all slept well. The studio was well thought out and planned. It had all the amenities we could have needed including a hot water pot, coffee, cream pitcher and sugar (especially liked the travel mugs for our walks in the Am).
Location is seriously second to none. One block from the Muni which you’re going to want to use as parking everywhere else is rough. Just a few blocks from the beach and Golden Gate Park.
Finally throughout the stay she was always available with any question that came up. The cottage is cute as a bug and oh-so-comfortable. There isn't anything that Tatiana didn't think of.
Apartment is cozy and comfortable for two people. Close to Hermosa Beach 10 minute drive but Venice Beach, universal studio and Disney is 25 miles but with LA traffic commute can be from 40-45 minutes! Use Waze so you will avoid traffic!!!
Robert Turpen are amazing hosts! They let me drop off my bag early before check- inch so I could get to wear I was going on time, and offered to hold onto them after I left so I didn't have to carry them around all day before my evening flight. They provided me everything I could have asked for, including the most amazing coffee (and cream and sugar) and tea and cookies.
Christian and Lori Stewart are lovely people who offer a warm welcome into their home. The littles extras such as coffee, homemade bread and jam and fruit was a lovely touch to making us feel comfortable in their home. We had the small bedroom off the kitchen area and the bed was so comfortable.
Susan didn’t miss a detail. All in all, I would highly recommend Susan’s place as somewhere to stay if you are in the Tacoma area. One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had.
Great location. Loads of amenities. We didn't want to leave!
Susan didn’t miss a detail. Thank you Susan ! !
It is also very convenient to the complimentary Link rail system so you can get all the way to the Tacoma Dome or other attractions like the Museum of Glass in a few minutes. Parking on the street was not a problem for us. Our host left detailed instructions that were easy to follow and her communication was great throughout the entire process.
Once in, the house was at a nice temperature and the room was very clean. I got to meet her the next day and she is just a lovely and kind person! (Her dog is full of love as well!)
Thomas George’s home is quite stunning and located so centrally to so much! If you’re not into public transportation, the Uber rides to attractions/sites are all fairly cheap from Thomas George’s home. The house is literally across the street from a market and Starbucks and right next to a parking lot, so we did not have maneuver San Francisco’s crazy parking zones.
It’s very close. We would definitely stay here again. They have set a high bar for what to expect for future corset with AirBnB!
It's located only two blocks away from the beach! The space was very clean, and we couldn't have asked for anything more relaxing. Jodi Stallings and Crystal Romero are great hosts who respected our privacy, and were quick to respond anytime we had a question.
Liz’s home is beautiful, spotless, and comfortable, and it’s located just a few blocks from beach. Elizabeth is a gracious host and is very helpful with directions and answering questions about the area.
Third, it was super clean and stylish. She stated that even though she knew it was a safe neighborhood, she wanted to make sure her guests felt safe at all times. Another thing I liked was everything was close by (2-3 mins away) such as grocery shop , Starbucks, other types of restaurants, and even Planet fitness.
The cottage is also super affordable, we paid half the cost of what a hotel was charging us in the area and got so much more. Heather also provided us with a well organized folder with menus to nearby restaurants. Overall my Mother and I give the Cozzy Cottage 5 stars all around.
And it should for hosts that deserve to be successful for their efforts. I’ll be back.
Plenty of warm water with good pressure. How are we supposed to describe in words the MOST AMAZING BB COUPLE we've ever met?? My wife and I have used Airbnb for a few years.
I don’t ever write the views but I was compelled to let you view review for Marcia’s place. She lives upstairs but you never know she’s there unless you contact her. I would highly recommend this place such a joy every treatment self and very affordable priced
Perfect Place to Stay! This lovely guest cottage was perfect, from the time we arrived with our two dogs to the morning that we happily headed home. The cottage had the relaxed classy beach decor we were looking for, with a comfortable bed and a great shower.
The studio was clean and had many great amenities like a heater, fan, and humidifier. The location is ideal. Street parking was easy to find.
I had a wonderful experience at Jimmy's place. Streetside parking was available too. The house atmosphere was down-home comfortable with continental breakfast & chocolates in common areas and had touches of 'posh' with the New Yorker & Bon Appetit on hand along with other amenities.
The lock system is very efficient as it does not require your phone or easy-to-lose items like keys. The hosts were very understanding when I needed to drop off my suitcases an hour before check-in. The neighborhood is really safe and I would definitely refer anyone to this particular Airbnb!
The location is amazing, near the beach and walking distance to many restaurants. We really enjoyed ourselves.
It is also a walkable distance from many amazing restaurants, which is very convenient. No worries about losing sleep from any outside noises! Additionally, my family brought our two dogs with us, and they were very cool about it.
The bedroom/bathroom were sparkling clean and had all the amenities you could ever imagine needing. The room is even cuter than the pictures, and the bed is super comfortable! As LGBTQ travelers, my partner and I felt very comfortable at Barb's place and enjoyed the neighborhood.
The only suggestion we have would be for the upstairs neighbors to be a little quieter in the mornings. We were awake, but if you are one that likes to sleep, be aware. The space is lovely, the neighborhood was fantastic and the location to Golden Gate Park and beach was wonderful.
Great hostess and cute bungalow. Quiet neighborhood and short walk to shopping, Cher Alexander and beach.
Scott is easy going, friendly - warm and involved just enough! So grateful for Scott and his home! We will be back!
Elizabeth’s place was an easy walk to my venue on the beach. The bed was especially luxurious – enourmous with super high-quality sheets and blankets and a broad assortment of pillows. The master suite was private and massive and gorgeous and super high-quality.
This was a quick weekend stop after I got engaged. My maid of honor accompanied me. Erik Dickson was very attentive to our need and helped us with our bag .
We loved our stay at Ron & Laurie's place! So many nice touch like Laurie's homemade granola,  Desperation Snacking Noodles (free ramen with beautiful bowls to eat out of),  great coffee and tea selections, desk with great view of backyard, nice selection of books (if you have time for reading), lots of bathroom essentials (loved having the makeup/face rub and hand lotion) and everything was so clean and bright! We would definitely stay here again!
They're keen to improve the stay of every guest (though I don't know how they could raise the bar any further) and respond immediately to any questions. We loved our stay and only wish that we've been able to stay longer!
Would definitely stay here again if I’m in the area. Heather’s space is beautiful. Super comfy bed.
Beautifully-designed guesthouse with chic, coastal beach vibes. Thanks so much, Richard Batton! We had a wonderful stay!
I highly recommend her place! Angela is such a wonderful host, so thoughtful with every detail she has put into her bungalow and was always thinking of us throughout our stay. This was a perfect stay and was a great location for us to bike around the beaches and also visit the city.
The home itself was beautiful, spacious, well-lit, and clean. When we arrived, it was just starting to rain so Nina met us in the driveway and offered to help bring our bags upstairs. She was extremely friendly and gave us a tour to make certain we knew where everything was, including many extra pillows, blankets, and towel .
Tyler's place was amazing. It was a bit on the dearly-won side but that was because it had all of the amenities of being in a hotel. We were provided slippers, robes, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrushes along with snacks, beer and water.
It was the cutest cottage ever! She was so responsive and accommodating. The love of my life and  sweetheart Was so happy to stay there.
At the end of a long day, grabbing a drink at one of the endless options of restaurants and bars in the area, relaxing in the huge jetted bathtub and then curling up in the sleep number bed is exactly what I needed. !
It has such fun style and great layout for solo or couples traveling. It was so nice to walk to Berkeley Bowl for grocery and then come back, make dinner, share a bottle of wine and watch a movie before turning in for the night. Jenny and Mark are lovely and so kind.
The space was clean and bright due to the natural light that comes through the windows. With epicurean touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plant , I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. We visited many of the places suggested on the card left for us in the room -- and loved them all!
It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Crystal Romero street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!
Clean, cozy, private, amenities, bicycles, coffee machine, microwave and a small fridge in the room. I just loved meeting them and their place!
A perfect place for a couple people for a getaway. I so enjoyed my stay at Paul’s guesthouse. I was in town for a wedding and wanted to stay close to the beach.
2 block from the beach :) I've stayed in many places and Debra Dibble's place is so well thought out and equipped. This place offers anything you might possibly need when traveling and many amenities.
Marc was very helpful! making sure we had bikes , boogie boards, and chairs for the beach. we were able to drop off our bags earlier the checkin, which was awesome.
It is small yet brilliantly efficient. I wish I could have given 7 stars for entry because the lockbox and door code were the easiest getting in I have ever experienced. Inside was soooo clean.
It's location is the perfect launching pad for both daytime exploring and evening shenanigans - all while nestled under some very tall and expensive looking buildings. Plus, Michael is a wonderful, engaging host who will make you feel at ease during your stay. He loves Chicago, and I do now, too!
Good size kitchen and dining area. World Health Organization wants to cook on vacation, anyway? Walkable shopping/dining/drinks options.
Many thanks to Maggie and John! Maggie’s place is so lovely! It’s clean and cozy and has everything you need for a weekend in NYC.
We barely couldn’t get out of bed. Thank you so much for allowing us to stay extra night!! We couldn’t stop talking about how much we had so much fun and we literally chilling lot there.
Bob and Sharann were perfect hosts. Local eating establishments are with in walking distance. The room is very spacious.
I would give her more than 5 star if i could! you won’t regret it!!!! :)
Apparently, Thomas George place is popular with honeymooners and it is easy to see why. The entrance path and outside sitting area surrounded by tall bamboos added to the charm. We coincidentally ran into Dan and Michael Krieg on the street outside the cottage and they were informative and charming.
I had a great stay here. Tammy is a wonderful host, it was really easy to communicate with her and she is really nice. The room is wonderful because you have your own entrance and you have everything what you need.
The TV is hooked up to Clifford Winkler and Amazon Prime, so we had all the entertainment we needed. Throughout our five night stay this came in very handy when we were tired from the day's events and didn't feel like driving to a local market. I wish we could have stayed longer!
It was a pleasure to witness how much love is in their home. Pat was up in the morning with coffee which my husband enjoyed. They always took time to ask how we were doing.
Apparently the main heat wasn’t working, but I couldn’t even tell. So it was nice and cozy despite the blizzard that was happening outside. Ewa also gave me quite a few suggestions about things in the neighborhood to do, places to eat, and how to get around.
Roberta Hallenbeck’s place was amazing. It has such fun style and great layout for solo or couples traveling. Great amenities and comfortable comfortable bed and couch to relax on.
It's very quiet at night which offers you a great sleep. We would definitely recommend this place to family and friends.
Third, it was super clean and stylish. Even the DVD Sleepless in Seattle was there too along with other movies. Also, refreshment in the electric refrigerator was provided for us which I thought was awesome.
We could have had fresh brewed coffee with creamer in the home and taken advantage of the provided snacks, but we decided to wander in the morning. It wasn’t clear to me from the write up, but there is a stacked washer and dryer in the home. Gloria was an awesome host.
Beautifully-designed guesthouse with chic, coastal beach vibes. Thanks so much, Paul! We had a wonderful stay!
Tiana and Derek were lovely hosts !Extremely accommodating, friendly and very understanding if we needed anything! Tiana was very prompt in responding to my texts and Derek was very kind to fill up air on the cruiser bikes that my brother and I thoroughly enjoyed! The cottage is super clean and zen like!
Wonderfully out of my expectation! John Brashier home has everything you can think of and can't think of. It's well decorated and stylish.
Big Recommendation! Deborah Hines
Grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are also within walking distance. I did not use the microwave or mini-fridge, but the fridge is ample for being mini! Photos and description are accurate.
The private parking lot in the back was a major plus and the area was very safe and trendy with lots of shops and restaurants up Milwuakee Ave. Ewa provided many different amenities when we checked in and lots of useful local tips. The room itself was decorated nicely and had VERY high ceilings which I loved. Even though the apartment was on a busy street, no outside noise could be heard from inside the apartment.
So it was nice and cozy despite the blizzard that was happening outside. I ended up not having to stay both nights I booked. Ewa was kind enough to refund the second night even though I let her know it wasn’t necessary.
It was quiet and peaceful amongst the city bustle below which you’ll have an awesome view of. Huge windows allow natural light and the kitchen which isn’t pictured is large, modern and well equipped. I plan to make this my go-to when coming back to the area, and wouldn’t hesitate to book again.
Everything was thought up! The beach is just a hop skip and a jump away! And most attractions that My wife and I wanted to go to where 35 mins(ish) away.
Book this place now! Marcia’s place was absolutely wonderful - from the view, food/ snack selection, special touches, to just a homey space. Everything was remarkably clean and everything we would ever need was available to us.
The bathroom is gorgeous; a huge skylight overlooking the city, and lovely custom tiled shower. Traci is a professional chef, and she leaves out breakfast options that make 'continental' blush. The deck, patio and yard are lush and inviting; I wish we'd had more time to sit and enjoy.
It felt very privy and quiet, but was just ~15 minutes driving from downtown Vashon. Chip provided everything you need: coffee, tea, toiletries, extra pillows and blankets, etc. I especially love the view of the water and the private deck.
Same was true for the day of my check-out - Mike kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. Bottom line: Excellent value. Perfectly outfitted space with the charm and character that defines the ideal airbnb experience.
My husband and I were very impressed with Lia and Gregg’s gracious hospitality and comfortable, clean apt.!! And, we LOVED their sweet doggie, Questa! She couldn’t be more friendly and polite!
This is the perfect little Boutique house for your stay in Redondo Beach it is lake located close to very great amenities especially the ocean! We were able to walk to the beach in the morning and down to our favorite donut shop called Bluestar donuts amazing and a great eatery that I think on yelp is five star called eat at Joe’s which is right next to a wonderful coffee shop called the boy and the bear. We were able to Uber easily when we needed to.
Geneva is quick to respond to messages and flexible. Jeneva’s cabin was so fantastic to stay in! I really liked all of the sticky notes, those were extremely helpful especially for the shower.
The apartment itself is clean, well furnished (loved having a hair dryer and iron readily available!) with plenty of space. We picked the apartment hoping to find a pleasant space still close to the city for cheaper than in the CBD and that was certainly what we found!
And, a warm gas fireplace on a cold weekend. I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as we did.
We didn’t even find a need to go to the magnificent mile. There is too much fun to be had hanging out in this area of town. We did go to Logan’s Square a bit.
Arthur Paddick is a great Airbnb host. Thanks Arthur Paddick!
On our last morning there, we had delicious croissants and lattes at Masse's, a little slice of Paris on Shattuck. We absolutely loved this little space that actually felt incredibly spacious considering. The aesthetic was on point, it was clean, it was comfortable and it was in the perfect location.
It was also wonderful being so close to Point Defiance, we went to Lois Davis (4 minute drive) right next to the park and had great seafood with a beautiful view, and went for a beautiful hike on a different day. This spacious attic apartment is a special place to stay, and makes you want to plant yourself in its cozy embrace and enjoy all its charms. I liken it to house-sitting for your girlfriend, who has magazine-worthy taste in antique collecting and design!
The location can’t be beat (especially for the price.) It is small but very private and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. If you are planning on staying inside through the entirety of your trip then you might feel cramped after a while but it is Southern California so I would hope you get out and take advantage of the proximity to the beach as well as the bicycles and beach comforts they provide for you!
We loved leaving the door open at night so our little one could run in and out. This is for sure our new spot to stay whenever we are in the area!
Zeena also gave us trip details regarding attractions in the area and it was a pleasure we took that into considerations. Zeena truly is the hostess with the mostest! A delightful, positive person with lots of great energy!
I stayed in the vintage time capsule for 3 months with no issues. The Laurel District is close by with plenty of cute restaurants. Lake Merritt (a 3 mile lake where plenty of people walk and ride bikes) and the Grand Theater (beautiful historic movie theater) are a couple exits away on the 580.
My brother and I were visiting Tacoma for a business trip. Amazing hospitality. She offered several times to take us to the grocery store and even to take us to a place where we were going to have dinner.
It was so nice to walk to Berkeley Bowl for grocery and then come back, make dinner, share a bottle of wine and watch a movie before turning in for the night. I highly recommend staying here if your in the East Bay Area.
Very helpful with recommendations and very accommodating. The unit is sparkling clean with everything you would need and you can't beat the location! The bed was extremely comfortable.
I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a wonderful respite from urban Berkeley. The cottage was so quaint and perfectly decorated, and there are some social kitties who will chat with you in the garden if you like. I only wish we could have stayed longer.
I enjoyed getting local fruits and keeping them on hand with the mini fridge. The bathroom was very clean and tidy. Most of all I just enjoyed getting to know them in our morning chats before I left for my daily excursions.
That brings me to my 2nd point - the amenities at Scott’s were fantastic! Nice pool table, beautiful clean bathroom with lux feeling shower, the amazon echo was more helpful than I thought it would be and having entree to a bike + all the beach gear (towels, beach chairs, etc) was an extra bonus. Finally regarding the location you cant beat it.
He's got bikes and is just 1.5 blocks from the beach. Onsite parking so you don't have to deal with hunting for on-street parking. And only 17 min drive to LAX for our early morning flight.
This place was really cute and well-prepared. Luis Hawkins was a wonderful hostess and the area was antic . Would book again.
We had a great time at Scott's place. The room was very thoughtfully arranged with some bite , coffee, beverages and local tips. There was an echo dot installed there which responded to voice commands like 'lights on and off' or 'play some jazz music'.
it's there!)! Definitely the best airbnb experience I have had to date and I hope we can stay there again! Thanks Janet Luckman!
John Brashier even provided an abundant bowl of candy in each room, I found this inspired. John Brashier was so awesome and welcoming, and the house is so quirky and fun. Even though he had little to no notice we were booking that night he accommodated us and everything was more than perfect!
Also Scott goes above and beyond to provide extra amenities that made us feel at home. The towel warmer was so nice!!! We can’t stop speaking about how comfortable the bed was and my gf loved the mounted tv lol.
I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a wonderful respite from urban Berkeley. I can’t say enough wonderful things about our stay at The Farm in Berkeley. The thoughtful touches that Sequoiah provided like the informational binder with places to try and the milk in the fridge helped make our stay so easy and effortless.
Overall, I couldn’t find a single negative about the topographic point (not that I was looking for one). Absolutely nothing negative to say! Perfect topographic point to stay in SF.
This is the second time I have stayed at Crystal Romero's lovely place and everything was just as perfect as it was on my first visit. I rent through airbnb very often and I can say that Crystal Romero is among the best of the best host out there. The place is comfortable, tidy and convenient.
My husband and I were thrilled that we decided to stay in Gig Harbor for our anniversary weekend. Though the Michael Buble concert at the Tacoma Dome was our ultimate goal, our stay with Zeena and Howard was equally as fabulous. We felt pampered from start to finish.
The home is decorated so meticulously and thoughtfully. If you are wondering whether or not to book your stay here, stop and just do it. You will be glad that you did!
The beach is just a hop skip and a jump away! Thank you Angela!! !
Thank you so much for everything Maggie & Jon! Will definitely stay here again following time I’m in NYC! xo
This is definitely a rare gem to find because it really is a beautiful cottage. She truly respected and valued our privacy during our stay. We love the thought she put into everything down to the tiny little things such as the snacks, the local eats, and even the extra blankets and pillows.
You can also walk to Laurel shopping district for a bite to eat and other shopping needs. The accommodation is antic for families (we hav (Website hidden by Airbnb) year old). The whole bottom floor of Laura and Gregory Simons’s house and their large garden was ample space for us, and was private.
Einfach nur perfekt! Wir haben uns extrem wohl gefühlt, das Zimmer ist modern und schick, alles da was man sich wünscht, sogar Aveda Shampoo....alles bis ins kleinste Lindsay Brown durchdacht. Die Lage ist einfach unschlagbar, Fillmore Street um die Ecke mit tollen Shops und Restaurants.
Pro tip: we found a great gluten free spot, Kirari, just a few min by car from the house. Paul's place has everything you could possibly need or want. He even messaged me at noon to say the space would be ready for early check in.
John Brashier and his dog Charlotte are so welcoming!! There were seven of us in total World Health Organization stayed there for six night . No crabbiness here!
;) They have a very beautiful home decorated with antiques and estate finds that make it truly feel like you're right at home. Our rooms and bathroom were very private and upstairs, and sparkling clean.
See you again,,, Teresa Knight has created an incredible green oasis in the city! He’s led an interesting life and the chance to chat was a real treat, and probably our favorite part of the stay!
Michael and Ben were fantastic hosts right from when we booked several months ago. Travelling from the house to bus to BART is no problem, but the area of 40th and San Pablo (local grocery store) had a host of unsavoury characters. Target is a much cleaner, safer option.
Christina’s topographic point is a charming haven in the city. The room itself is so spacious and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. It’s supremely quiet there.
we were able to drop off our bags earlier the checkin, which was awesome. Keurig,  towels, a fridge, water bottle , and great water pressure in the shower with very easy communication! oh, and the location made it very easy to relax in Hermosa.
This was a nice little topographic point for a one night stay in the city. Bennie Dudgeon is one of a kind, such a great person and amazing host. She’s so flexible and hospitable, she really wants your trip to be antic .
Thoroughly enjoyed this property! The owners provided local tips and timely communications before and during our stay.
We did not meet Rod, but he communicated almost immediately when we had question , offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in directions were clear. Danielle's place is very roomy, clean, and comfortable to stay in. Everything you need is in her place even a washing machine and dryer.
This place was absolutely wonderful. The space was cozy and clean and Francis Jones (and his sweet dog Olive) thought of everything! They provided coffee, a French Press, and an espresso machine, plenty of tea, and had a handbook of suggestions for places around the island.
My family had an amazing beach week at The Carriage House! Brent was a caring host, attentive and super responsive to anything we needed. The house had a pretty, coastal vibe throughout -- we enjoyed all of the decor.
A fantastic spot to relax during your time in Tacoma. The 2 beds (in opposite corners of the large room) are outfitted with fresh, cozy linens and both provide a private space around them. The loft is conveniently located near freeway access as well as walking distance to incredible restaurants, parks and other prime Tacoma attractions.
Beds were comfortable, everything was clean and nice. Check in was easy. Hosts were friendly.
2) Her house has no AC but the fan was great for the unseasonable hot weather during our stay. Don't hesitate to stay at Cher Alexander VERY reasonably price and comfy home.
It is the best Ikea styling I have ever seen in real life. • The kitchen (and the fridge in particular) were sparkling clean. It was stocked with more than the basics, which was great since we always shop for breakfast food when we arrive in a new city, and found a Trader Joe’s quite nearby.
Heaven. Loved staying at Nevas and will definitely be back. Traveling alone I wanted something nice but affordable.
Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! The second day on arrival she checked in with us to see if everything was OK. There's also a library of books regarding SF history, tours, to borrow at your disposal.
The place was fabulous! Some things you should know....  1) it only takes 4 1/2 minutes to walk to the beach! 2) the place is bigger than it seems in the picture (and really nicely kept)  3) her recommendations were spot on.
There was a fire pit, and patio furniture to enjoy her adorable yard, it really was perfect! Sheri Vowell was an excellent host. She is very friendly with a warm personality and responsive to any question we may have had.
Quiet, very private, serene. Looks exactly as pictured, lovely and warm. Susan and Roy greeted me on arrival, even though it was past stated check-in time, to show us the studio, where everything could be found, and invited me to enjoy their lovely garden (with koi pond) at any time during my stay.
It's secluded but within walking distance of local breweries, coffee shops, great restaurants and the beach (which has everything you could want/need). The bed is comfortable and the linens are clean and soft (and there are extra in the linen closet which is always nice!). The TV/sitting area is a nice place to unwind after a night out or a day on the beach.
To top it off - breakfast! She is the best Airbnb I’ve ever experienced, and I’ll definitely be returning to see both her and the lovely Samantha (sweetest dog ever).
If you are looking for a place to stay in Redondo Beach, this is it! It’s a cute cottage located one block away from the beach. It is also a walkable distance from many amazing restaurants, which is very convenient.
This is the gold standard of any place we stayed! Erik Dickson provided excellent communication and high end bedding and mattress. Best sleep I've had!
Not far from the beach and well located for any of the beach attractions. She provided coffee, water, and snacks that were much appreciated. Highly recommend.
The bathroom is very clean and updated. They also allowed us to stay late on our last day due to our flight. Tammy and Marc really are so thoughtful and easy to communicate with.
We had a marvelous stay at Marcia's place. When we had trouble w our car, she offered to drive us 30 minutes to take care of the issue. We can not thank her enough for this generosity.
Neva’s place was very sweet it was perfect and very convenient to many shops right across the street to Whole Foods any many Restaurants & cafes Luis Hawkins nice sheets and a comfortable bed , lovely bathroom great outdoor space . Beautiful quaint place in a lovely part of Redondo Beach. The topographic point is smaller than most hotels as described but very comfortable & was a great base to set up driving into LA (about a 40 minute drive).
My aunt and I had a really great time! Would rent again for another Tacoma Dome night!
The towels were soft and fluffy and there were plenty of them. That no doubt helps with the energy use but it takes a little human adjustment  We ended up taping over the bathroom light sensor so it didn’t blast on in the middle of the night when one of us wandered into the bathroom. • The building is on a busy main street, which concerned us as we arrived -- I am very sensitive to noise.
The room was clean with plenty of towels. Bikes, beach chairs and towels were provided. All in all great stay and would definitely come back to Tammy in the future!
Thanks so much John Mullins! The bikes provided us with one of our favorite days in LA and it was these thoughtful amenities that made it one of the best Airbnb stays I’ve ever had!!! 100x better than any hotel could have offered!
Dennis Steward was a very gracious & helpful host. The bungalow was nicely decorated and stocked with supplies for continental breakfast. The location was very convenient to the beach & groceries.
And, the entire suite was spotless--a clean freak's dream! We kept very long hours during our holiday, typically returning to our suite after midnight, so we were glad that we didn't need to disturb our hosts too much. We would definitely stay here again, given the opportunity, and highly recommend it to everyone!
It was lovely to begin the day with morning coffee in the darling courtyard space (espresso and/or coffee, tea, cream and misc. I hope to stay at this fantastic guest house again and highly recommend it.
This was our first Airbnb stay and our first time to Norfolk! The Carriage House sits on a beautiful, clean beach in a residential area. Each time we walked to the beach we only saw a few other folks either jogging or walking their dogs.
Top-notch guest house—loved it! Located in charming neighborhood just a few minute’s walk from Taylor St. (Little Italy), where we ate at four different places during our 4-day stay. Convenient and delicious options so close to home.
We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. Natalia was also a great host she communicated clearly and even checked in with us to make sure all was well. Thanks Natalia!
Joseph Lewis’s place was exceeding . Joseph Lewis and Marc were very helpful with everything. Definitely stay here if you’re looking for a quiet small getaway.
As my first Airbnb experience, Maggies place surpassed my expectations with her eye for details, the cleanliness of her apartment and her attentive attention to the needs of her guests ( complimentary snacks and toiletries) has made my holiday one of the most memorable stays in New York and I can’t wait to return ! This was my second time staying in Michael Krieg and May's home, but my first time staying in this room. The house, as it was during my last stay, still amazing: it's a beautiful space that is well-maintained by May.
Paul was welcoming and accommodating. We loved using the bikes Paul had available to ride along the strand! Thanks for a great place to stay!
Marc's place is like everything you want from a boutique hotel with none of the bother of dealing with other guests or the awkward encounters that sometimes come with them. It offers a beautiful queen-sized room with a street view, a spa-like bathroom (super fluffy towels, lavender shower products..), and a small station with a microwave, coffee machine,  kettle, and plates for all your lite bite needs. It also has good and easy to control heat, which was a welcome respite from the cold rainy weather during my stay.
My favorite part was the way she had stocked the bathroom with all these adorable little toiletries. It was just such a nice touch and came in super handy when I realized I'd forgotten a few things. I would recommend this place to anyone and very much look forward to staying with Angela again in the future!
Kitchen with all the basic requirements. Heather’s apartment is full of detailed information on local restaurants etc. Washing and drying facility on the property.
We loved the quiet neighborhood and the ease of extra parking on the quiet side street just a half block away. The location is minutes from the freeway, UPS, old town Tacoma and Edwin Green. So happy to have picked this spot- thanks again and we will see you again!
Which was a major plus for us. The neighborhood was great. Plenty of topographical point to eat and bars to check out.
We loved our stay at this stylish studio. The neighborhood was beautiful and we spent a lot of time just walking around and admiring the homes. The place itself was quiet and spacious, with a private entrance and great natural lighting.
! A great place with thoughtful touched and decor! We loved the topographic point and the location was perfect....truly one block from the beach!
Enjoy!!! Marc's place was perfect for our 2 night stay in San Francisco . It was exactly what we needed as a launching pad to explore the city.
One great thing about this area is the bike path on the beach that goes all the way to Santa Monica. I would not let this deter you from renting as the location,  cleanliness and gracious hosts make for a great stay. We would definitely go back.
Whatever you are looking for he will be able to help you find it. All of the recommendations he provided were first rate. When looking  for our accommodation in San Francisco there were so many choices, we are very glad we picked Tyler's place.
I would highly recommend her place for short or long term stays. Lovely little patio with great airflow. Can't think of a single complaint.
My wife and I are not bothered by a lack of toilet privacy but in case you are staying with another person, just take it into consideration! Overall, it was a wonderfully affordable option and I would stay there again and recommend it to others.
Room had more space than expected and provided great comfort, warmth, and amenities. Neva was very nice even though we chatted for just a minute. Parking was easy and out front.
Location location! A beautiful place very clean and everything you need. We loved  the cruisers included for beach riding... A wonderful host.
My husband enjoyed the few conversations he had with Nina's husband. Sadly, due to the hurricane we felt we needed to leave early so we wouldn't be caught in traffic and Nina was very understanding! We would highly recommend staying here and definitely wouldn't hesitant to stay here again!
I highly recommend Arnold Jackson’s place. Both Arnold Jackson and May are most welcoming hosts and will do anything to make your stay a happy experience. We asked if it was OK to bring our little grandson to stay overnight for a couple of nights and they even made him feel very comfortable.
The only thing I can complain about is not having enough time to enjoy this space to the fullest, since I was in town for a work event and had to leave at 7 the next morning. It was so easy to communicate with her! Thank you Gloria!
Bennie Dudgeon was quick to respond to every question we had. We absolutely love the bed and her true care for the comfort of her guests. We even ordered a set of the pillows that she has because they are amazing!
The room itself is so spacious and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. I loved her home and yard with ducks! Quack quack   The neighborhood is pleasant for walking around if you stick to the high streets.
I met Joe in the morning and he was a charming, lovely person..I really appreciated him making us so welcome. We drove a few minutes, parked near the station, and caught a train that got us to the heart of the city in 30 minutes. I heartily recommend staying here, only wish we had for more than one night!
We loved everything about it. The gardens are amazing, with bright beautiful flower and trees as the view out each window. Sequoiah was a gem - present, helpful and she gave us some good local tips.
There is also a lovely bar on the corner which had live music and poetry reading while I was there. All in all, a wonderful stay - I look forward to staying again the next time I'm in Berkeley.
On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore way which runs alongside Lake Michigan. If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great.
The amenities are more than you could need or want, and the place is stylish, very functional, and super clean. We prefer this location to many other neighborhoods - Noe Valley, North Beach, Richmond, Marina, even Pacific Heights. It is great for biking and walking - not so hilly - very convenient transportation (N Judah line).
When we were there, the temp outside was like 31 degrees. But the AC in the home (1 in each room) is cold enough to make it super comfortable in the WHOLD area. There were snacks for us, beers, pop, prepared for us.
The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. Cher Alexander's place was very nice and comfortable  A clean and modern place with all the amenities need it for our days in the area. The kitchen has everything you need to cook when needed it, it has a blender!
She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. Leslie had instructions (wifi, thermostat, tv, etc) and rules printed out for us. The kitchen was stocked with all of our cooking needs (pots, pans, utensils) and all the cabinets were labeled so everything was easy to navigate.
Plenty of towels, blankets, and sheets. And the bed...I had the most restful sleep I've had in calendar month ! We were bummed to be only staying for the weekend and definitely will be back.
It was my first time renting an Airbnb so I was nervous if I was gonna do something wrong or something was gonna mess up but it was a wonderful experience! One of them slept in the hammock ❤Pamela Drew and I’m 19 now :) So cozy and a lovely experience! I also forgot I left an unopened bagged salad in the fridge so the next people who show up have a salad they can eat!
Tiana is extremely friendly and super hospitable. !
The place is adorable, very clean, great location, & the parking spaces were so nice to have (not always a given in the area). Checking in was a breeze despite us arriving late on a weeknight. Tiana was great at communicating by responding quickly & made sure to touch base throughout our stay to be sure we were comfortable & had everything we needed.
There's no wonder why she's called a SUPERHOST and always booked! picture are accurate, and if anything kind of undersell the place. It’s more wide than it looks.
You have your own privacy and street parking wasn't terrible either! It is on the 3rd floor so if you have heavy luggage just be ready to carry it up a flight of stairs (totally do-able)! The closet was huge and the balcony puts a nice touch on the suite!
It was the first time that I stayed at a house that was shared by the owner. I especially enjoy riding bikes and loved the trail! We stayed for 3 nights prior to going on a cruise out of Long Beach, and this area was my favorite!
The room has everything a normal hotel room would have, and more. We had a wonderful stay at their place and would stay again anytime we visit the area. Thanks Tammy and Marc!
Tammy’s place is 2 blocks from the beach and about a 5 minute walk from the downtown Hermosa area. The room has a private entrance so you can easily come and go and have your own space. It was a perfect location for a long weekend in LA on the beach!
First time Airbnb'er here..  Neva's place was exactly what i was looking for.. Way better than renting a room in a house..    Neva Rocks!! She is a super nice host and will definitely book with her again.
The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a bike shop close by called Switching Gears. It was very obvious that Chris and Tim knew and love the area. They offered so much invaluable advice that made our travels and experiences so smooth and memorable.
The washer/dryer hook up is handy for cleaning your clothes. It looks exactly as it does in the pictures too, so no need to worry about overly flattering Photoshop enhancements. Joelle herself: Like I mentioned above, Joelle is outstanding.
I had not the opportunity to meet Kelly, however my partner did it. Ah! One last important thing, we did not see any homeless in the neighbour during our stay!
Their hospitality really went above and beyond what was required or expected, and we felt like special guests in their beautiful home. Thank you!
Michael is the kind of host I hope everyone gets to encounter through airbnb. He is perfectly welcoming, doesn't overlook details, and truly made my stay in Chicago special. I loved that I could drop my bags earlier in the day before check-in to go exploring sans-baggage.
It was wonderful and held us over until lunch. Dan and Traci are so friendly and nice and their hospitality is top notch. If you’re lucky enough to wake up to Traci doing her actual job and preparing food for her client , the smell will make you want to eat everything up.
This was my first time visiting San Francisco and I have zero regrets staying here other than wishing I booked for a longer visit. I can already say I miss Kelly’s place. It’s extremely modern, the bathroom is flawless, and the bed/pillows are wonderful.
It was great! Had everything you needed for a convenient and comfortable stay. Would recommend!
She lives in a very quiet neighborhood, I stayed with two of my other friends and we did not feel insecure at all! This small apartment has everything you may need and more!! From restroom amenities to having Apple television to having small snacks!
Alan  and Ruth McGuffog We stayed at Maggie's and Arnold Jackson's house for 2 nights. It was an amazing place.
Target is a much cleaner, safer option. In all, the hospitality that Raquel Eastham and Mike showed us really outshone everything else. They are genuinely lovely people who make a great effort for their guests, and I can't imagine anyone leaving their place feeling otherwise.
I had everything I needed. I was particularly shocked and happy about all the cooking supplies that were available to me. The popular dinner/bar spot “MUA” is only a 6 minute drive away.
All in all great stay and would definitely come back to Erik Dickson in the future! Great location at Hermosa beach! Lovely private one (Website hidden by Airbnb) has a microwave, mini fridge( with bottled water) and keurig.
Paul was very responsive and checked in to make sure our stay went great. There were also bikes, beach items, towels and other things available to visit the beach and explore. There is adequate dining, grocery stores and other shopping within a short walk or drive of Paul’s place.
This room was BEAUTIFUL! The location was perfect for the event I was attending and Elizabeth was very sweet when I met her. I would def stay here again if I’m back in the area.
Leslie’s thoughtful, speedy  attentiveness made the lodging part of our trip an effortless high point. Leslie is an outstanding host and went above and beyond setting up her home for an amazing stay. First of all, the open floor plan, warm lighting, and inviting atmosphere was very welcoming & made us feel right at home.
This was a really wonderful spot. Crystal Romero was a fabulous host. Access to the house via her garage was offered, though street parking is also very easy.
it's very easy to get anywhere you need to go in the area from this place as well. All in all, a wonderful experience. thank you so much, Ian and Tenzing!
Ken and Kurt are the perfect hosts and such lovely people we really felt at home with them. Thank you Ken and Kurt we shall certainly come back to your topographic point when we return!
Thankful that we had a wonderful & pleasant stay at Marty’s place. Marty’s place was the best place we could imagine staying during our vacation to San Francisco! Her place was immaculately clean and the bed was super comfortable.
We arrived to a fresh baguette on the counter and milk in the electric refrigerator for our coffee. We had such a lovely stay and would love to come back.
If you are looking for a break from the buzz of life, I can’t recommend this studio highly enough. I really hope to stay here again. Thank you for sharing a part of your universe with us Brian and Hillary!
We used the full, modern kitchen to cook several meals--we had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay! We even spent some time fishing on Lake Whitehurst which is located on the property. This was our first Airbnb experience and we think that Chuck, Charlotte, and Wiseacre have set the bar so very high!
It is beautifully decorated and the hosts have thought of everything! We so enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and location. It is easy to get to restaurants, shopping, etc.
About a 10 min walk from the BART and a short stroll to lots of vicinity spots. Very clean apartment; convenient location. It's quite small, essentially a bedroom and the front hallway and bathroom.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. small things like a bed warmer (! ), excess toiletries if you forgot something, and even scissors (sounds silly but I needed one and was glad to find one!)
Peg and Jeff’s place was wonderful. Check in was easy and Jeff was very welcoming, telling us what was around the local area - he even brought us some milk! The apartment itself is lovely, clean and cosy - I don’t think the photos do it justice.
Ewa was such a wonderful host! Her home was lovely, so clean and had nice touches. There was coffee and tea as well as a few snacks.
Really appreciated the private patio area too. motorcycle were a small tricky to ride when you’re not used to “chopper”style handlebars and are accustomed to handbrakes. But definitely a very nice space.
He liked to be out with the flowers on the rooftop. This location is a premier spot for everything you need. We walked everywhere and parked our car in the sterling garage a block behind our building.
Jeni’s condo was a true oasis! The view from the back bedroom was priceless - Mount Rainer in all its glory and sparkling city light overlooking the Sound... This was truly an exceptional Airbnb experience, and one we hope to return to any time we are in the Seattle / Tacoma area.
The place was so clean and Debra Dibble has an amazing local guide! Debra Dibble’s topographic point was perfect for our stay. Perfect location, just a couple blocks to the beach.
This place is delightful. It’s very stylish and a perfect size for two. It was extremely clean and an excellent place to arrive at after three nights camping in Yosemite.
We loved everything about it. The gardens are amazing, with bright beautiful flowers and trees as the view out each window. Sequoiah was a gem - present, helpful and she gave us some good local tips.
Maggie and Jon's place is than any hotel. Very thoughtful layout and great local information was in the apartment. A real attempt was made to make our stay hospitable.
Scott is a great host who has gone above and beyond to create a great experience for his guests. From step by step guides to local grocery stores and eateries to towel warmers and LED lights Scott has thought of every detail that will provide a wonderful experience for his guests. Having stayed just short of three weeks, I most appreciated the gourmet kitchen as I could cook some meals, the patio to enjoy some fresh air, and the fact that the beach was within walking distance of his home.
I have used many enjoyable Airbnb’s while traveling, but Tyler’s home has really raised the bar (my expectations will be way too high now!!). Traveling to a new city for a vacation, you want to find the best of everything so you enjoy your time...well...Tyler made our whole vacation so enjoyable!! I asked for several recommendations and he had a variety of options for anything I asked.
The host and hostess were very kind and amenable. Overall, great experience and great price.
Thank you again for everything and I would love to come stay here again the next time we visit Berkeley! This is our second stay at the cabin with gracious hosts Teresa Knight and Amy. We chose it for the proximity to our daughter and son-in-law, but we would choose it even if we did not have family in the neighborhood.
Walking on the beach in the morning and watching surfer out on the water was a real treat!! We can't wait to come back to San Francisco and stay here again!!! Thanks Heather!
The studio was well thought out and planned. The bed was comfortable, room stylish, great lighting and open space with vaulted ceilings (which I’m a sucker for). The location is great with a short walk to Pamela Drew, coffee shops and restaurants and a Farmer Market that we visited on Sunday.
We loved our stay at this cute and stylish studio. I loved the colors, the decoration, and the natural light in the morning. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the neighborhood was quiet.
This is the perfect place to stay in Hermosa Beach! Check-in was a breeze, the place was spotless and had lots of great amenities, allowing you to pack light! The bikes and beach gear were the perfect touch, being just a block and a half from the strand.
Her place was sparkling clean, comfortable and the décor was spot on. It was our first Airbnb experience and we loved it, and hope to visit again.
Staying here was like being at home. It was our first experience staying in a private room so I was a little hesitant. But Elizabeth’s attention and personal touch made us feel welcomed and comfortable.
We weren’t even there for 24 hours and were disappointed we couldn’t stay longer. It’s a great location close to the beach and the gorgeous park. Also didn’t take long to reach the airport!
Exactly what is promised is delivered. Neva is very kind and accommodating! You will be happy you booked with her!
! We will definitely stay again if we're in the Redondo Beach area. The place was clean and T was very responsive.
I appreciated his conversation and his excitement at sharing the house with us. He's a lovely, kind man who doesn't unnecessarily interfere with his guests and makes sure that we treat the house as if we were his roommates. I felt at ease and well rested at Joe's place!
The topographic point was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Elizabeth Jones commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon. This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts.
It has a cosy, relaxing feel and only a few minutes from the beach. Being able to use the bikes provided was a treat, which allowed us to explore much more of LA. Alejandrina Anderson for being a great host!
You'll love it! Elizabeth’s place is so close to the Redondo Beach pier. We took our bikes and spent hours biking along the coast.
It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. Yummy coffee and ample dishes and supplies. Thank you!!
Paul's place offered  even more than we expected. Everything felt brand new and stylish, spotlessly clean, quiet, comfortable and safe. It is a spacious feeling studio with many special touches and amenities to make you feel at home.
A true godsend when you are many miles from home! Hurricane Matthew had left branches and debris all over the yard and when I showed up to check in (early) Bob was already taking care of it to make sure the yard was perfect for our wedding! If you are thinking about a place to have an event, or even a place to get away you’ve found it!
I love fresh air so in order to air out the studio I had to leave the door open a little. The neighborhood is amazing, just steps from the Mission but far enough to not be loud or have dirty streets.
the stay in this house is awesome. very nice furniture, a super comfortable bed, huge shower with finally (very rare in California I had to recognize) enough water pressure... even beachtowels and a fully equipped kitchen were available. Next time I'll definetely come back to this lovely place
Roberta Hallenbeck allowed me to check in early so I could enjoy a drive on one of the complimentary beach bikes which was just what I needed after my long flight. A+++
Everything was clean and comfortable, and we had a very pleasant, peaceful stay. I would absolutely stay here again! Thanks for a great stay :)
I really can't find a single thing to list here that I didn't like. Overall, a fantastic place to stay. I will be back and try to stay here anytime I'm in the Chesapeake, Virginia Beach, Norfolk area.
Redondo beach was a great spot, a little quietter spot - away from tons of tourists, but still not far from the more popular areas. Paul is a great Airbnb host. My wife and I have stayed at many Airbnb’s and can honestly say this was our best experience.
Room was small but excellent! We appreciate the coffee, water and all other amenities. Great resto recommendation!
They are excellent host World Health Organization are kind, considerate, and thoughtful. They provide everything you need; you don't have to worry about bringing shampoo or Q-tips. Everything is there!
She had fun little touches all over the space, with helpful little notes that anticipated any question or need we might have. I hope to return there again on our next trip!
You can either walk to the famous spots or take the bus, which stops near the house. The supermarket, which is located right on the other side of the street, offers all the stuff you need for your stay. There are several really good restaurants and cafes in the direct neighborhood.
First, it's a lot bigger than I expected. Third, it was super clean and stylish. Forth, big flat screen TV and a DVD player was provided.
She was a great and responsive host. We liked that the neighborhood feels quiet and residential but is still close to some great coffee shops and restaurants. I would recommend this spot for sure!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we are looking forward to returning to San Francisco and enjoying his hospitality. Tyler's knowledge of San Francisco is second to none. Whatever you are looking for he will be able to help you find it.
Lois Davis is a great host. Welcome basket includes fresh squeezed orange juice, bread, delightful jam, etc. Lois Davis has always been responsive.
Janet Luckman and Charlotte (the sweetest pup) were the best hosts. We used the full, modern kitchen to cook several meals--we had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay! You can expect to enjoy incredible  art, lake views, stunning sunrises and sunsets, nature all around, and the moon peeking through the top of the massive living room windows at night...absolutely beautiful!
I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. Mona had a list of restaurants and things to do in the area that was a very nice touch. The neighborhood seemed very safe.
I would love to come again if I'm back in the SF/Oakland area. Their street is very comfortable/safe, but a few streets from the BART West Oakland to their home may seem unsafe or less well kept. If you're uncomfortable, getting an Uber/Lyft is quick and convenient, as well as contacting Christian and Miranda Malone for the best walk route.
In some ways, I'd have to say that it's not as described because it was bigger and nicer than I anticipated from the photos! The living room area is about 1 and a half times bigger than the bed area, there are tall closets for hanging, a couch, TV with cable, gas stove, and a small table from which you can see the water. The kitchen has the basics, including a two burner plug-in for cooking, and a nice long counter for all your stuff.
It was also cool to see all her cooking and fermentation projects going on in the kitchen, as someone who is also passionate about that stuff it was fun to stay with someone else who loves to cook. Easy parking, close to airport and pretty close to everything else including some great hiking trails about 10 minutes away. My friend who lives in the area told me it is pretty close to a sketchy area so you might notice it as you drive through but you can tell the houses change and this neighborhood felt 100% safe, no concerns with safety.
We stayed here for just under two weeks and loved it! With the spring rain we were surrounded by lush green, had a mountain view, a outdoor deck, well renovated and kept studio apartment to be cozy in, and with a car it was easy to get to amenities and ‘the city’. We cooked mostly in the toaster oven and it worked great with some creative meal planning.
The topographic point is cozy, comfortable, stylish and there are so many small details that make it feel just like home. Loved our stay here - wished we had stayed longer and would definitely return.
I had an excellent stay at Jenny’s place. The house was very easy to locate and is situated on a quiet residential street with restaurants, coffee shop , and public transit just a few block away. The studio was perfectly clean and well-stocked with kitchen & bathroom amenities, linens & towels, and just about anything one might need to feel at home.
We have stayed at numerous places in the Hermosa Beach/Redondo Beach area and this is bar none the best place to stay. Tiana’s beach cottage is a wonderful topographic point to stay in Redondo beach. Not far from the beach and well located for any of the beach attractions.
The place is great! Elizabeth’s house is perfect!! Location is convenient.
Kelly's place is probably the nicest Airbnb in San Francisco for 2 people. As soon as you walk in, you'll see how spacious the room is and how tall the ceiling are. Everything is immaculate and stylish.
Now I know why they call you a super host because your place was super cool! Also, thanks for giving us the opportunity to stay at your place while in Chicago. It was a good experience!
The guest house was neat and homey, decorated very cute. There were some cereals and coffee provided for us as well! Beautiful outdoor seating.
There is an keyless entry to the apartment. There is a store one block from the apartment where you can buy the basics for your stay. It is near by to the public transportation.
Like a good neighbor! Also a great location.
Literally nothing bad to say. Leslie's place was impeccable on every level. The home was so bright and cheerful, and the kitchen had all the amenities and then some for those that are super inspired to cook for themselves.
Loved having Logan visit us in the courtyard :) Neva was very lovely and accommodating. Beyond excellent experience!
I stayed at Lauren Jensen's place for a night and it felt like I was at a hotel. I will definitely be booking with Lauren Jensen again in the future!
Be sure to come here if you want to experience the quieter (better) side of Virginia Beach! Katherine is a great host and her place is incredibly cozy and very relaxing. The mattress is very comfy, very firm (slept well even though I usually prefer a softer mattress) as is the rest of the room.
The house is well maintained, in a nice neighborhood with restaurants and shopping within walking distance. We would not hesitate to stay their on our next visit to L.A..
Peg and Jeff were very responsive and communicated with us on the day of our arrival and to make certain we were comfortable during our stay. Had a wonderfull stay. Noe Valley is the best area when you dont want the hustle and bustle from Fishermens Warff.
My dog Benson and I had a great stay at Mona's place! We were in town for a quick 36 hours for a wedding, and Mona was very accommodating with helping us check in a bit early. She even offered to let my dog out while I was at the wedding, and lent me a phone charger when I realized I forgot my own.
This is a phenomenal space that gives you a superb experience of luxury in the city. When you climb a few more stairs to enter the common living area shared with your host Tyler, you get a breathtaking view across the Mission to downtown a few miles away, as well as the hills climbing up to Noe Valley and beyond to Twin Peaks. This modern “open space concept” area is done exactly right, and just as open space fans intend — with gracious sitting, eating/work areas, that wonderful aquarium, and an astounding assortment of their collection of interesting libations on glass shelves.
Although, we had not met Aaron, he was always available when needed and was pretty clear with the instructions. I’d recommend Vietnamese town (tank noodles is always my #1 spot) and try not to park in 975 W Wilson Ave if you can’t find a parking spot, we booked it using SpotHero and had many complications. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience and we had a wonderful time!
Gloria is also a very friendly and helpful host World Health Organization communicates and responds quickly. Absolutely loved our stay and recommend it to anyone for a nice, intimate getaway in Tacoma :)
Debra Dibble was a wonderfull host and made our stay memorable. A severe snow storm came through Tacoma while we were staying and she made sure we had breakfast and gave advice when it was best to continue on our journey. The apartment was perfect and Debra Dibble provided excess snacks which came in handy as we arrived late.
Great place with amazing vibe, near the pier in Redondo beach and next to Hermosa beach. We could not expect anything better for our last days in LA. The hostess Elizabeth was literaly a superhost, super kind an friendly.
My two youngest and I had the benches in the great room for our beds. The kitchen is to die for. Every amenity imaginable.
Also, the bathroom is probably the nicest part of the place. Kelly is very responsive and easy to communicate with. Overall, if you can book this place it is WORTH it!
If you want a quiet beach vacation or long weekend, this is an excellent choice. You really have run of the house and Chuck really thinks of everything. There is an abundance of everything you could need for your stay.
Wonderfully out of my expectation! Scott's home has everything you can think of and can't think of. It's well decorated and stylish.
Thanks again, Brent! Everything was PERFECT! The Carriage House was Very Clean, nicely decorated, beds were comfortable, the kitchen was stocked with every cooking appliance that we needed for our stay, lots of great coffee flavors, snacks, and even a bottle of wine, the new deck was beautiful too !
Gin and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! He is very enthusiastic for cuddles, and so sweet! Quick and easy access to downtown, via or the pubs/restaurants of the area via train, or bus.
Neva’s place was private, clean,  and well located between Redondo and Hermosa Beach. I was really taken by her thoughtfulness to guest (Website hidden by Airbnb) awesome. I would definitely stay there again.
Elizabeth's room is spacious, clean and very quiet. She is also within walking distance of the Redondo Beach Pier which is a plus if you want to go down to the beach. I'd highly recommend staying there.
It's my first time in New York, everything went well. Hot water came out right away (it's really nice to get hot water in this cold winter time), the kitchen made me feel like home (there were foods!! ), the laundry place was perfect.
We felt more than safe coming in and out of Ken & Curt’s coach house and felt safe knowing they were close by. The space was clean, organized, and easy to find fully equipped with espresso pods and bite . We would highly recommend this place and would love to stay again if we ever get the chance.
Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed amenities. You will simply love the location of this home. You are located one of the coolest areas in San Francisco, Mission Delores in the Castro district and there is so much to see & so many places to eat.
On our last morning there, we had delicious croissants and lattes at Masse's, a little slice of Paris on Shattuck. Walking distance from everything you needed and a short Lyft ride to the Fox Theater. Parking was no issue.
We barely couldn’t get out of bed. This is our first best experience ever to book the first Airbnb spot! I’m so glad I chose the right one!
Yet for all you gain from a home stay sometimes you sacrifice a little of the crisp cleanliness and amenities of a professional environment. Not so at Tyler's topographic point ! Not only was it lovely to be in a home in a neighborhood, but the room was like a lux hotel suite!
The cute little hideout and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. We were blown away by this great discovery and hope to be back soon! :)
Danny runs a great place and is clearly an experienced host who has learned the needs and wants of his guests. The bedroom is comfortable and has nice touches like a floor fan to keep you cool and a phone charging station on the  nightstand. The living room is a cool place to relax over breakfast or to read a book in the afternoon.
There’s large trees and it’s very tranquil. The room is comfortable, and nicely decorated. The bed is comfortable, and you won’t want to get up.
Thanks again. Also Elizabeth is nice and accommodating! Highly recommend this room!
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. Angela's place is absolutely gorgeous! Loved the fire pit in the back with the string lights at night.
Central location makes anything you need an Uber ride/Bart/walk away. I got to fall in love w Oakland. Will definitely be back!
The decor and amenities of the bedroom were awesome. The main living areas were just like the pictures and the view from the home was awesome. I wouldn't mind coming to just hang out there and have dinner and a drink, maybe following time when I can stay longer than a weekend.
She kindly held the cottage for me beyond the reservation deadline while I found a friend with a smartphone to help me verify my ID. (In future, though, I will probably look for someplace that's more walkable--handier to restaurants. You need a smartphone or a tablet to order from Domino's Pizza, and Jimmy John's said we were outside of their delivery range.)
Tyler has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience. What a fantastic start to our US road trip.
If we didn’t live on the East coast I would stay here more often. I highly recommend staying here if the dates are available, but don’t wait because I think the word is getting out and people are finding out how great this place is. Can’t go wrong here for a enjoyable, relaxing, romantic weekend!
The place was so clean and Jodi Stallings has an amazing local usher ! Plus the beach is walking distance!! Definitely look forward to staying here again!
This is such a nice place. The location is stellar and the place is nice. In terms or cleanliness and amenities, it was perfect.
Appreciated our own entrance and all the extras, ie. Would definitely do return visit. Thank you!
We didn’t even find a need to go to the brilliant mile. There is too much fun to be had hanging out in this area of town. We did go to Logan’s Square a bit.
After a long day at the beach, we were able to wash away our day in the oversized  shower (loved the shower so much!) and watch movies and relax on the bed and the couch (also turns into a full size bed) with our kids. Check-out was equally as easy as check-in, we just had a really hard time saying good bye to the place.
On our first morning we did not have any dollars yet, so they lent us some money to get on a bus to the city. Now go make that reservation! !
Host was very nice and informative. Honestly, this was one of the best experience I've had while using AirBnB. I cannot say anything bad about this topographic point .
The neighborhood was quiet except for the occasional neigborhood children laughing and somobody playing saxaphone in the evening! AMAZING! My lady and I took an evening amble down sixth street and perused the many restaurants and shop .
I live in Tacoma and have traveled the world for 25+ old age , and must say I plan to again drive the 3 miles from my home to Christiana's studio, just to take a "stay-cation". Linda/Mike were great hosts! John Mullins quick responses in communication and their rooms were much bigger than expected!
Bonus for all the extra linens, iron and ironing board, and bedding. Very respectful of our privacy. Would definitely stay here again
Very clean and comfortable updated bathroom and bedroom. Fridge, microwave, coffee maker . The space is tucked between two beach houses and is a block from restaurants, a fantastic deli , homemade pie shop and the beach itself, including the adjacent strand for biking .
Also didn’t take long to reach the airport! Definite recommend and would certainly return.
We got in after midnight, but she was happy to show us around, and even brought us fresh popcorn! The hosts have also gone out of their way to provide local tourist information, some games and toys for children, and an assortment of DVDs. It is located in a low-key, friendly, suburbanish neighborhood.
It's well adorned and stylish. He also provides bicycle but we didn't have time to ride to the beach. Yes, it's pretty close to the beach.
Everything was so nice---easy to locate, good parking, immaculately clean, great snacks and breakfast foods, beds were very comfortable with great bedding. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated and Susan left little notes everywhere explaining everything from where the extra toilet paper was to whether or not the fruit was washed and how to use the TV remote control and Edwin Green. She had snacks for us and a great breakfast.
The apartment is comfortable and quaint. It was nice waking up in the morning and having a cup coffee on the deck. The kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea, coffee pot and Keurig, filter , sugar, cereal and juice.
I would definitely come back! This was a perfect Airbnb topographic point ! It is as nice as it seems in the pictures.
The place is beautiful. I have zero complaints and hope to be able to stay here again.
I came here to Norfolk Virginia to hang out with my 4 grandchildren ages 13, 10, 6, and 5. The owner, Matthew An, is as kind, friendly and accommodating as you would want a host to be, and then some. The grounds are spectacular and vast with something to peek your interest at every turn.
Everything was very clean and functional. T is a wonderful host who went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. We highly recommend this place and look forward to coming back.
PERFECT. AWSOME HOSPITALITY... and so much more! The little touches, the big smiles, the location, the comfort, the value, the cruiser bikes, the beach and incredible, perfect, awesome affable reception say it all.
Angela was a very great host! She accommodated to all our needs and even to our late check in due to the drive! It was a very clean and homey house that made traveling feel more like moving in for three days.
Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! I also walked over to Berkeley Bowl for some groceries and downtown Berkeley for some dinner. Leslie was very responsive - and made checkin/checkout a breeze.
Maggie's place is in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. Maggie is an amazing, friendly host; she responds quickly to our problem. We arrived in late evening and it was pleasantly surprising to see Brita and Beer in fridge!
We had fun and laughed a lot with Shantell Preusser especially when we ate and had drink together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . And by the way those new 4 recently refurbished rooms are so beautiful with individual bathrooms ; high ceilings and have an early 20th century style . It was a great pleasure to have stayed in your place Shantell Preusser .
The bathroom is big and nice. The room has everything a normal hotel room would have, and more. Tammy and Marc are very helpful and friendly people who are passionate about hosting guests.
Nina’s tiny home is making me re-evaluate my life choices. The collection of Kerrigan coffee and teas were such a nice touch, and even the sparkling assorted sodas in the refrigerator was a nice surprise. There’s an organic market within 5 minutes of walking, and I was able to buy coconut creamer and other items.
Their place is truly a respite. (Website hidden by Airbnb) - Wonderful; Incredible; Spectacular Sunsets;  Eclectic; Astonishing; Comfortable; Relaxing; Exceptional!!! These are just a few words which describe Lauren Jensen home and setting.
First time Airbnb'er here..  Neva's place was exactly what i was looking for.. I would highly recommend staying at this Air BnB! Neva was a great host; very communicative!
The apartment is a short walk away from bus stops that are about a 20 minute ride from downtown. Tyler himself is very accommodating and gave us loads of useful tips on our first day of how to get around, useful apps and even gave us great recommendations for what we should do on our first day. (Which we decided to do and ended up being our favourite day in San Francisco).
I loved this simple and calm space. The Wi-Fi at the farm is great too. Despite being designed as an open space, the layout of the farm is situated such that it felt really private.
Nala is also helpful and communicates with you in you in advance of your trip so all is well. Nala is a great host; I would love to stay here again!
Staying at Sheri Vowell place is an Dennis Steward experience. If you’re looking for a very relaxing space with a great host then this is the place for you! The large room (with balcony) was well lit with natural light and had a wonderful breeze flowing through it.
I love Redondo Beach; Elizabeth's is a great place to stay. Lot's of beach activity, restaurants and stores are near by. Parking is easy.
She makes you feel part of the family immediately! :) The rooms are light, bright, and spacious. The only drawback for me was the stairs up to our room.
Lori Stewart and Debra Dibble are amazing host ! It is a quick drive from the airport and even short drive to Oracle! You can tell that a lot of time, effort and care was put into the studio.
We loved the overall brightness, and the windows gave a pleasant glow to wake up to in the morning. Best of all was the attention to detail. We really felt welcomed, and at home.
All in all, a wonderful experience. You will love this cozy nostalgic dawdler from the 1950s. Jodi Stallings, Capra and Vyla are a fantastic host family!
You can hear his family walking in the apartment upstairs, but that is the nature of apartment living, and did not detract at all from the loveliness of the apartment. The driveway to park in was a definite bonus, it helped us save money by driving in instead of flying. It's nearby public transportation, so we left our car in the driveway and avoided having to pay for parking all week.
Lots of little details that made my short stay worth the drive outside of LAX airport area. The cottage is very comfortable and clean in a great location for visiting LA and the beach. Extra touches like condiments in the fridge, and a Keurig were great.
Bed is massive and so comfy too! Set in a great little area - easy to get down to the bay and some really great local food place (we particularly enjoyed James Walker’s sushi tip!) very quiet area.
Elizabeth’s place was very clean and cozy. My boyfriend and I were able to check in early and she was there to greet us. She gave us a tour of the room and told us everything we needed to know.
Easy short drive to grocery shopping, restaurants and down to the VA Beach boardwalk area. Sadly we did not cross paths with Janet Luckman or Barry but their personal touches, including a thank you note and a list of instructions/restaurant suggestions, made it feel like they were already friends of ours! My husband, son and I felt so comfortable in the space and it was just like a home away from home.
Beautiful room and home. We truly recommended it!
We briefly met Neva when arriving, she is friendly and nice. The place had a nice cooling unit, and the room felt so large and comfy, the rain  shower felt awesome and the patio is beautiful and nice to hang out on. Only a few minute drive to the beach.
We loved every moment that we had in Tacoma in Proctor College and will be recommending it to everyone who considers coming into the area. If you get the opportunity to stay here, sign up right away! !
The cottage (aka OPC) is quaint and cozy, and it is the perfect size for any couple looking for a beach getaway! We absolutely loved our stay here. The location was perfect and we could walk to restaurants, trails, and the beach.
While we found it too far to walk down to the waterfront, we were able to explore the whole downtown and university area on foot. BTW, although a lot of the restaurants were closed when we went out for dinner (Monday night), we fell in love with the patio area at Jupiter and their salads were amazing. All in all, Roberta Hallenbeck's space was a great choice for us from which to explore Berkeley, and Roberta Hallenbeck has done a great job creating a very livable and welcoming space for guests!
I did not have to interact with her a whole lot because the direction and labels in the house are so spot on and intuitive. I'd have to look for her properties every time I'm here.
Tyler was easy to communicate with and gave good recommendations for places to eat. I would definitely stay here again.
You can’t miss if you are lucky enough to stay at Paul’s place. It is beautifully appointed and spotless. You can walk to beach and restaurants.
Nevas place was adorable and so comforting. She had coffee shampoo conditioner extra pillows and snacks! It was such a great stay.
Very clean, high tech room with a super comfy bed, really nice shower. Met our needs perfectly as it was within easy walking distance of our son. Excellent communication with host and super clear instructions about access to the place.
Pure delight!! I highly recommend booking T's place for your stay in Redondo Beach. From the initial communication and all the way through my stay she was exceptionally responsive and accommodating to all of our needs.
Their bedroom is across the hall, but I never saw them; they know how to provide privacy. In the morning, I went downstairs for coffee, and we ended up having a great conversation for quite awhile! They also provided simple breakfast things, which was so kind of them!
Lucky for us, the sun was out this week so we got a beautiful view of the water, and Marcia was kind enough to let us see more of the view from her own balcony. She provided a lot of info on where to eat close by, and where to shop. She was kind enough to provide snacks and drinks that we took advantage and ended up staying in on our last day watching a football game on her big Screen tv.
! Paul’s cottage is perfectly setup and ideally located close to the beach and restaurants. Cottage is cozy and comfortable with great attention to detail... snacks, beverages and games provided.
She even had beach towel , beach umbrella and anything else you may need for a trip to the beach. She is absolutely a wonderful host and super welcoming. We highly recommend this lovely home.
The studio is perfect for two people to live comfortably. It has modern features and great interior design. If staying in the Tacoma area,  Susan and Roy’s place is by far the best option.
Then to San Francisco where we had lunch in China town and watched the Women's March on Market Street which was HUGE! It is fun and funky and authentically eclectic. The artistic touches and the environmental concerns were a plus.
And the outer sunset has a cool bohemian thing going on. This was my first stay in an Airbnb and I was very satisfied. Tyler provided some toiletry essentials (shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, q-tips), and there were plenty of condiments and cooking essentials (salt, pepper, other seasonings) which was unexpected.
When we were planning our exploration of San Fran, Ron and Lauri visited our space, drawing maps, suggesting favorite restaurants. We were especially touched when Ron met us outside to say goodbye while Uber was picking us up at 5 am.
My favorite part of the place was the mini library that included a slew of books on San Francisco. Overall, I couldn’t find a single negative about the place (not that I was looking for one). I’d definitely recommend it to anyone else and also would stay again during my next visit.
Bob & Sharann’s place provides not only a reasonably priced stay, but in addition, a lovely patio, a place to store & heat food, a fireplace (my personal favorite! ), coffee, & snacks. Another thing that puts them a cut above other places, is they check-in to see if you need anything and go out of their way to help, if they are able.
Will definitely be a regular here. However, good pizza isnt too far away! Thanks so much Sheri Vowell and Jon.
Definitely recommended! Relatively close to lax. Comfortable and very clean queen bed, good internet, bathroom very clean though shared with another Airbnb guest.
Maggie has a comfortable and very nicely furnished apartment. Although the living / dining room is a little bit narrow for four persons (in relationship to our local housing conditions), but it does not reduce the overall impression of this beautiful apartment.
The host was very communicative, thorough and very helpful. Very comfortable! Angela is very sweet and she always asked if I needed anything.
A coffee maker and electric kettle rounded the entire thing out! A table large enough for four now sits in front of the window where the desk used to be (see pictures for reference). The desk has been moved closer to the door, which makes it a convenient spot to place your keys or bags.
The topographic point is very stylist, extremely clean, and offers all the amenities you’d need. Rayford Kelly is also very quick to respond to any issues and will help in any way he can. Extremely courteous!
Keureg machine with plenty of coffee cups to enjoy every morning  Close to Whole Foods,pharmacy and Hermosa Beach! 2 bikes you can ride to Hermosa Beach Parking is not a problem- there is designated apartment parking and also street parking if needed  Laundry next door  Eat at Joeys restaurant 2 blocks from apartment nice place for lunch and breakfast- definitely try this place out!! Apartment is cozy and comfortable for two people.
My family and I could not be happy with staying here. Not only was the coach house immaculate, but it was cozy, inviting, and full of thoughtful touches. The space was just right for our group, felt safe and private despite being in the city.
Wish I could’ve stayed longer. Had a great stay, The place itself is clean and very cozy and loved the little backyard, what a great place  to enjoy little breakfast after a morning run/walk on the beach (which btw is only a walking distance away:)) Would absolutely book again.
Speaking of the bed, it's really comfortable and perfect for resting after a day of hiking the hills of San Francisco, and Tyler provides multiple sheet options for you which is a nice touch. On a clear day you can see from Elizabeth Jones right across to the skyscrapers of the financial district and everything in between. Tyler is a super friendly host, and has plenty of tips for places to visit in the local area.
Thank you so much Tiana! We had a great weekend in Tianas cottage. The location is perfect for a restful getaway.
We had so much fun at Paul’s place! Super close to the beach and a 10 minute walk to several delicious restaurants, coffee and breweries. Highly recommend.
Check in was easy. Nonetheless, I received very good feedback from Igor World Health Organization is always very accommodating prior to the stay (from our direct conversation) and throughout their stay (as per feedback from my parents). The feedback from my parents that I received is that the room is nice and clean as per the description.
The quaint pubs and vintage shops along 6th ave were closed for the night but looked promising. I wish we could've spent a bit more time in the area to pop into the local shops.
Little things like the coffee and motorcycle really made you feel at home. Very close to local businesses and the beach. The decor is very cute and the small details really made it.
We wanted to move in. We are so thankful we chose this topographic point ! Immaculately clean.
The picture represent it perfectly; it is exactly as lovely, bright, airy, and comfortable as it appears! The cottage has everything you need to feel immediately at home, check in and check out a breeze, great food in walking distance, and the beautiful beach stairs away — I woke up to the sound of crashing wave every morning. Absolutely a five star experience.
I love this place. The actual place is so cute and clean, and decorated in a beach theme. There is a brand new grill outside with a table (with umbrella) and chair setup .
Min’s home is quaint, cozy, and equipped for even the coldest weekend in Chicago! We were greeted and welcomed by Min himself. He reviewed the check in procedures with us and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.
Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. Check-in was incredibly smooth as well as check out. Everything is just very smooth and laid out for the guest.
Amazing place near the beach and you'll be hosted by an amazing person (Angela) she offered us dessert and was replying to all our questions quickly and her answers were so helpful. She has a cute dog we loved it so much. She offered us bikes to browse the neighborhood  The place is amazing and would fit two ppl perfectly.
It is amazing! He has thought about all kind of little details that make your stay really pleasant. The place is gorgeous and of course, Luis Hawkins is very kind and helpful.
The apartment is lush and artsy; it’s got a real lived-in, make yourself at home feeling. The location was perfect for us, easy to walk to excellent coffee and eateries. Michael was generous in his hospitality and you can tell that renovating spaces is a true passion!
This IS the Airbnb ultimate experience! I will definitely stay there again. Thank you Jeremy Johnson!
We hope to come back soon! Angela absolutely nailed it. When we arrived she was there to greet us with candles lit and a kitchen stocked with beer and bite (both regular and gluten-free) just like a hotel.
Felt much more like a cute little inn so we didn't feel like we were invading anyone's personal home. Elizabeth is a great hostess and very accommodating. The price was great too!
Also- I cannot overstate how fantastic it was to have a parking spot! Unfortunately I didn’t get to meet Thomas George in person, but I would definitely love to stay here again following time I’m in Oakland.
The room is at the back of the house and it stands alone in the garden. It allows large extent of privacy and it's quiet at night that we could have good sleep. Mishaa is so considerate that she arranged a small table with 2 chairs outside the room that we can enjoy the tasty coffee in the morning, surrounded by lovely flowers and plants in the garden.
Bathroom is right next to it. With al the dainty . Also recommendations are printed out for you.
Our clean, bright and comfy room was more fantastic than we had hoped for. Very helpful hostess and nice kitchen to make snacks and morning coffee! You'll love it!
If you’re visiting San Francisco for the first time I absolutely recommend staying at Arthur Paddick’s home, just make certain you check out Outerlands (across the street) for the best brunch in the city! Arthur Paddick’s place is great and even if you travel with kids, 4 people can fit easily. Arthur Paddick replies fast to any question and finds a solution to any issue that might arise.
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. Debra Dibble's place is absolutely gorgeous! Loved the fire pit in the back with the string lights at night.
Also worth mentioning is the access to a washer and dryer - when you’re away from home for almost 2 weeks, it’s beyond helpful to be able to have a chance to do some laundry and have more clean clothes. When traveling I prefer Air BNB to hotels. Yet for all you gain from a home stay sometimes you sacrifice a little of the crisp cleanliness and amenities of a professional environment.
Paul was an awesome host, responsive and super communicative. I definitely will try to book again when I visit again!
There are some great restaurants and a grocery store store nearby- we loved the area. We also thought the locals were extremely friendly. Brent and Jodi Stallings Carriage House is clean, comfortable, and has every little thing you could possibly need.
Downtown Chicago is about a 45-55 minute Uber ride during the week. Location/neighborhood is superb as we were within 10-15 mins drive of trendy restaurants and bars.. Home space was very trendy and cozy, which was great for hanging out when the storm was heavy, and beds were probably the most comfortable I've slept on in all of my stays on Airbnb. I would absolutely love to stay here again whenever back in Chicago.
The room is exactly as pictured and had loads of thoughtful touches and was a true home away from home. The apartment is a short walk away from bus stops that are about a 20 minute ride from downtown. We much preferred being out of the city and away from the hustle and bustle.
Marc and Tammy are very friendly and excellent hosts. A couple things to note are that it is nice they provide bicycles,  just know that they are older. They are fine for just a short ride down the beach but if you want to go any farther I would suggest renting some bikes.
Go sit outside on the awesome patio and talk about how lame its going to be when you have to leave this place. The space is exactly as represented in the photos and description:   this is a very sleek, stylish, clean,  and  modern casita, with a great bed, bath,  and amenities. Particularly loved the wonderful light, windows and  design elements of the ceiling and interior.
The space is beautiful, comfortable, clean and very inviting. The host was very communicative, thorough and very helpful. We’ll be back for sure!
Tammy and Marc have truly thought of every detail to make it a comfortable stay. Great stay with Marc and Tammy! Awesome space for 2 and a great location.
An absolute gem of a place! Chuck and his dog Charlotte are so welcoming!! My children and I came for my son’s/their brother’s wedding.
We had a room upstairs with a cute loft, which is especially great for a family with kid, though we didn’t use it. The only pity is that no cooking is allowed, as it is a shared living place. Igor is nice and quick in response, and we really thank him for keeping our luggages even after check-out time.
We had intended to leave earlier,but slept in till checkout because we were so comfy. I met Janet Luckman in the morning and he was a charming, lovely person..I really appreciated him making us so welcome. The location is good for access to downtown.
We'll stay here again next time we're in town. We loved every minute of our stay at Elisa and Jay's loft. It was charmingly decorated, with all amenities of home and more.
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. The location is a spot off the beaten path and there’s not a ton of restaurants close by but there are a few and some with position out on the water. It’s only about 20-30 mins to Tacoma depending on traffic so you have options just be prepared to drive or Uber.
We initially were going to stay for just 2 nights, but our plans required for a longer stay and Jeanna was more than accommodating  When we tried extending our stay, we had issues with the Airbnb website and Jeanna was so understanding and caring about the issue we were having. We were impressed by the design of this place -- an ingenious use of space! The kitchen and living areas are comfortable (only two chairs at the table, though) and nicely decorated.
A severe snow storm came through Tacoma while we were staying and she made sure we had breakfast and gave advice when it was best to continue on our journey. Loved the humming birds. Came to the feeding station in the middle of the snow storm.
Easy to park, clean, large and comfortable room and the perfect location blocks from the beach (perfect for my morning run). Very close to the beach, quite neighborhood. Elizabeth is very kind and warm person, very easy to communicate and quick response.
We found her suite after discard a lot of options and I felt in love with the photos available in airbnb. When arrival the suite exceeded my expectations! The suite is amaizing and I have no words to describe the bathroom!
Tiana was an amazing host. I was SOOOOO in love with everything even the small backyard area. This is a phenomenal place to stay.
This is my third stay at Igor's place, which has now become my NYC base! Fantastic clean space, easy access to amenities, and a great neighborhood made Igor's place a fantastic choice for our stay!
Maggie and John were amazing hosts. They are quick to answer any questions you may have, but they also give you your space and privacy. The check in and check out process is very easy.
Tip top of a spot. Can't say enough good things about Cher Alexander...I'd let her baby sit the kid I don't have. There's a bike two boogie boards and a beach chair too.
Although I wasn't sure from the home description, there are actually two small spaces to sit outside and enjoy the weather--on the front porch and on a bench in the front yard. The home itself has lots of charm and is nicely decorated throughout. The large open living/dining area is a great place to relax.
This place offers anything you might possibly need when traveling and many amenities. There are many special touches which make you feel very much at home. The location is ideal and offers easy access to the beach, shopping, restaurants, and more.
She provided a lot of info on where to eat close by, and where to shop. Overall, I highly recommend this topographic point if you’re looking for a peaceful getaway. Jeremy Johnson is a fantastic host with great communication.
Melissa's place is not fancy, but it was within cycling distance of the beach and restaurants, and she was friendly and helpful with dining suggestions. The room is simple, and well decorated, and the bed was comfortable.
Truly a beautiful quite neighborhood not far from the beach at all! The space provided was beyond comfortable, and Mona's communication was excellent! The neighborhood was super friendly and a sight to behold with a small near by lake.
They would check on you to make sure everything you need to keep you comfort! Oh on behalf, I couldn’t live without their outdoor hot bathtub and mediated room! ❤️
Also see my review December 2017. Francis Jones was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make certain I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed.
Most of all, we loved chatting to Jenny and Rayford Kelly on the morning we left. They are extremely cool! Jenny even gave us a lift to the car hire centre as we were leaving to go hiking in Yosemite the next day.
Angela’s place is spotless and in an excellent location, with the shops around the corner, water across the road and beaches a short bike ride away! She’s super thoughtful and the place is really cozy. I will not hesitate to book this place again.
Double that in heavy traffic, but we did not mind because we loved this casita so much! I am so glad we found you Melia! It was fantastic and we thank you for everything.
This is definitely a rare gem to find because it really is a beautiful cottage. She truly respected and valued our privacy during our stay. We love the idea she put into everything down to the tiny little things such as the snacks, the local eats, and even the extra blankets and pillows.
We hope to see Geneva and Brian again! I’ve been lucky with nearly always great places where I’ve stayed with AirBnB. But once in a while something is just that much better than the rest for yourself and it leaves a footprint in your travel memory.
The desk has been moved closer to the door, which makes it a convenient spot to place your keys or bags. Communication with Bennie Dudgeon and Adriana was great--they were quick to respond and you could tell they were really invested in your comfort--so much hospitality! Overall, an AMAZING experience.
I don’t ever write the views but I was compelled to let you view review for Rayford Kelly place. Everything about it was beautiful: the location ,  the view, the ability to see the view, the outside living space, We were welcomed by a complimentary tray of wine and snacks. She communicated quickly and efficiently each time I contacted her.
The atmosphere Crystal Romero and Elizabeth Jones have brought to this loft is fun and I'd recommend it to anyone with some artistic flair who wants a getaway near the Tacoma dome! This peaceful, beautiful studio made us feel transported into a different life. There were sweet little surprises everywhere: a record player and exciting record collection, super cozy beds, romantic twinkle lights, games, puzzles, wise handwritten quotes, unique handmade furniture, fascinating screen printing supplies, ect.
in great quantities which really makes the accommodation very homey and generous. To sum up : we loved it !
He was super friendly and sweet. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!
This apartment, although small, was perfect for our purposes. Everything was quite close and we didn’t feel the need to drive anywhere. More friendly and helpful hosts you could never find.
My boyfriend and I needed a “down/relaxing” weekend. We really enjoyed: Chapel pizza, Rockafellas, the Waterfront, Repeal Bourbon and Burgers, Chix’s, Bad Ass Coffee nd the Shack on 8th! We also did a dolphin cruise through Ruddees.
! I love the little notes that they have! By the mirror there’s a note that said “you’re beautiful”  they have the softest, coziest blankets ever!
We hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future. What a FANTASTIC space! So beautifully appointed, and such great style.
We loved this spot! It was super close to the beach, very clean, modern and stylish! Loved having the use of bikes and all of the little touch (coffee, water, pop, snacks).
Igor's house is immaculately clean and fresh. He does not allow outside shoes to be worn inside which I appreciate as it is a rule in my own home. The house is beautiful and the location is convenient to Manhattan and extremely convenient to Lois Davis.
One of the awesome cute touches they have are post-it notes everywhere, little paper signs that explain things in a sometimes funny manner. Reading about the age of the house, the light-switch coverings being made from old newspaper which used to be the first wallpaper of the house, the sidewalk to nowhere or even the helpful "Knives here!" "First-aid!"
He also responds quickly when you have any questions. There's also a BART station not too far away, but we never needed to use it. Overall it was a great stay, and really was like the hotel experience in Tyler's home which is quite impressive, especially since you'd be paying a far higher rate for the hotel equivalent and it would be far less personalised.
The place itself is also very spacious with a great back patio and beautiful high ceilings and skylights! I had a very quick stay at Peg and Jeff's place, but none the less, it was a fantastic one! They're space is absolutely beautiful, and so thoughtful.
Best airbnb EVER ! We highly recommend the place and we will come back for sure ! Bisous from France !
As well, the neighborhood is very cool. Not far from downtown either. We didn’t even find a need to go to the magnificent mile.
Grace’s place is sparkling clean. Even on barefoot you wouldn’t feel dust on your feet. The place is so stylish and I love the simple touches on every part of her house.
The room is clean and comfortable. Igor is very nice that letting us to keep our luggage for late check out.
I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a wonderful respite from urban Berkeley. If you stay here, it'll likely take you a bit to adjust to the shower and water closet, if you're not used to that type of thing, but I thought it was really fun taking a shower in a greenhouse. It's deserving mentioning that there's not a microwave or stove, so if you plan on cooking/warming leftovers, you may want to take that into account.
Lots of restaurants nearby. The bedroom is large and comfortable. Scott welcomed us to use his large kitchen and outdoor patio area.
The highlight of our trip was riding her two new motorcycle up the coast to Santa Monica...what a great day we had! We never used our car once. I can’t recommend this place enough.
I was determined to have a swim in the ocean before Hurricane Florence. Fortunately my two day weather window coincided with availability at Katherine’s. She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out.
Ken's place was clean & comfortable; it was within walking/ train distance of everything that we needed. It was truly cold in Chicago when we were there, and it was wonderful to have plenty of clean towels, sheets, and warm blankets. Parking and checkin were really easy, and Ken was easy to communicate with.
Had a great stay! Though I never met Gregory Simons in person, he was quick and clear with communication. Check-in was a breeze.
We initially were going to stay for just 2 nights, but our plans required for a longer stay and Jennifer Merry was more than accommodating  When we tried extending our stay, we had issues with the Airbnb web site and Jennifer Merry was so understanding and caring about the issue we were having. We were impressed by the design of this topographic point -- an ingenious use of space! The kitchen and living areas are comfortable (only two chairs at the table, though) and nicely decorated.
The apartment is stunning and welcoming, the room is spacious with every amenity you can think of. The apartment is located within walking distance of mission district and with good bus links to the city centre and park areas. Tyler and his partner were warm and friendly and happy to help with advice and suggestions of places to go.
Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. She has everything ready in the morning for her guests to help themselves to a complete continental-style breakfast. You might have an opportunity to meet another guest in the morning and share a bit of conversation with your morning coffee or tea - it was a very easy and comfortable stay.
My boyfriend and I enjoyed it and felt welcomed. They have amazing touches that really make you feel at home. Thanks guys!
An awesome Airbnb experience....our stay at Igor's place was great in every way. Very nice home in a great Queens neighborhood. Our friendly conversation with Igor and May upon arrival set the tone.
100 star ! If you are staying in or near Redondo Beach, you will not regret staying here ! Richard Batton I could have her as a host all the time !
The desk has been moved closer to the door, which makes it a convenient spot to place your keys or bags. Communication with Julia and Adriana was great--they were quick to respond and you could tell they were really invested in your comfort--so much hospitality! Overall, an AMAZING experience.
I enjoyed getting local fruits and keeping them on hand with the mini fridge. The bathroom was very clean and tidy. Most of all I just enjoyed getting to know them in our morning chat before I left for my daily excursions.
My husband and I traveled with our two small kids (6 and 2) but I also think this would be a perfect spot for a single traveler or a couple looking for a quick getaway. Brent's place was in a great location, the home furnishings were comfortable and very well themed for a beach house, and the space was well utilized for it's size. It's a perfect amount of space for 2-3 people, and the Keurig coffee maker and the huge variety of coffee flavors was an extra touch that we greatly appreciated after long flights from the West Coast.
I cannot believe how special and fantastic Michael Krieg’s space was! She goes above and beyond to create an experience that is particular for guests. I cannot wait to come back!
The place itself is beautiful--spacious, stylish, comfortable, with a lot of attention to detail and very very clean. I definitely plan to be back here.
Quirky, unique apartment in the attic space of a gorgeous old house. We especially loved the luxurious marble shower tucked into a turret! The kitchen is well-stocked, and we had a wonderful weekend relaxing, watching TV, and thumbing through the travel books on the shelf.
Neva’s Petite Boutique was exactly as stated in her description. The living space was perfect for my teenage daughter and me. Parking was available all times of day in front of house.
Ken and Kurt are the perfect hosts and such lovely people we really felt at home with them. The down side to our stay.... nothing at all! Other than we had to come home.
We love the thought she put into everything down to the tiny little things such as the snacks, the local eats, and even the extra blankets and pillows. 5/5 stars. The cottage is best if just 2 people.
매우 친절하고 밤에는 조용한 곳이라서 좋아요 그리고 비치와 가까운 거리에 있고 매우 친절하게 대해주셨어요! i love her house. i recommend her house
Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Laurie and Ron. Your privacy is respected, yet they remain available if you need anthing. I appreciated the tall, locked gated entry into my area, added a feeling of security.
I had a very comfortable stay at Christian's place, the space was great and very clean. Loved sitting outside in the garden/patio area as well! About a 15 minute walk to town, very doable, and also very accessible with buses and the BART station.
Wow, there are so many reasons why this place is a 5-star choice for your lodging needs in DuPont! The suite is convenient and comfortable, yet private and peaceful. From your own private entrance and parking topographic point to the private bath and secluded garden patio, all things were perfectly appointed!
This was the perfect place for us to stay in while in town for a family reunion. Every morning we were greeted with a breakfast spread of coffee (Keurig), bagels, cereal, pastries, hard boiled egg , cream cheese, and yogurt. They had cow’s milk and almond milk.
The location felt like a secret hideaway, with Zeena's designer touches making it feel warm and inviting. Her dining suggestions in GH were spot on for what we wanted. Our conversations were pleasantly enjoyable, and we loved our room!
Enjoyed my one night stay in a private bedroom in Sheri Vowell home. Check in was very easy since the host sent me the code in advance, and it was nice my bedroom had a separate code on it too since there were other guest rooms in the house. The room was very clean and comfortable, fresh towels, and face cloths on the bedside table!
The location is perfect for a relaxing getaway. Plus, with the beach cruisers Tiana provides you can get anywhere! The space has everything you’ll need and Tiana is super hospitable!
Everything about our time at Angela’s beautiful bungalow was wonderful. Thank you Pamela Drew ❤️
Overall it is such a great space, location, amenities as advertised, and Amy and Dennis were so responsive, welcoming, and we loved meeting their dog too! We felt safe, and it was nice and quite and peaceful. My husband also fell in love with the coffee :) .
Her communication is so friendly and helpful that she really made our stay even more memorable. If you're planning to go to Southern California, do yourself a favor a book some time in Tiana's space. We booked 3 different locations on our 8 day vacation in California; One in La Jolla, one in Anaheim, and this one, but we probably should've spent the entire time in Redondo as the home base.
Tiana has a great team that takes care of the space, is nearby if you need aid , and will provide everything you could ever need. And the shower pressure is fantastic! The living structure they've created for travelers is very special, but the location is really what makes this place a gem.
It was so nice to walk to Berkeley Bowl for grocery store and then come back, make dinner, share a bottle of wine and watch a movie before turning in for the night. I highly recommend staying here if your in the East Bay Area.
Easy walk to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. It turned out that the bedroom windows didn't open and since there was no ceiling fan or central fan, it felt airless with the door closed. I'm someone who's used to sleeping with an open window.
 delectable coffee and ample dishes and supplies. !
Once inside we were amazed on how clean the whole house (including the private bedroom and bathroom) is! Later that day we met Francis Jones and his spouse . They were very friendly and we had a good talk about our trip, traffic, places to see and where to get different kinds of food.
The hosts are kind and attentive. Anything you need, they'll have a resource. I'm already trying to figure out a reason to come back to Tacoma soon, just so I can spend more time there!
I can tell that he takes much effort into making sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. We got free slippers, the most comfortable bed, and a private bathroom as well. There is a refrigerator, desk, tv, and travelers information about getting around San Francisco.
The accommodations felt thoughtful. We loved the 15 minute walk to the pier so much we went twice during our nightlong stay. Will definitely rebook if we are ever in Redondo Beach.
Bonus for all the extra linen , iron and ironing board, and bedclothes . Edward Ramsey was a really nice host. Every time we crossed paths she was very warm and welcoming.
Cozy and well decorated place conveniently located in Redondo Beach. A short walk to the marina, beaches and close to Whole Foods and lots of food options. Well provisioned for a nice getaway.
With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. Lori Stewart place is LA's hidden gem. If you are looking for a postcard perfect beach, a great host, a quiet neighborhood, somewhere that is close to everything LA has to offer but is outside of the bustling concrete jungle - this is it.
Their home had such beautiful, thoughtful touch that we really enjoyed! It was clean, the view was absolutely beautiful and it was so comfy. I would definitely come back and stay here again!!
The place is beautiful. It’s always great to encounter good people. The place is walking distance to many delicious restaurants, bars and even the beach path.
We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises.
He has thought about all kind of little details that make your stay really pleasant. Whenever I go back I’m hoping to stay there again.
Good location, easy walk to beach and eating places. With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. We biked along the esplanade all the way to Manhattan beach!
And sparkling clean is not an enough word to describe the bedroom and bathroom. I will keep using Airbnb when travel but I think Zeena's five+ star hospitality has set an extremely high bar for my future stay :)
This was my second stay at Susan and Roy's space and it met and surpasses expectations again. The extra touches of the quality sheets (so warm) and attention to detail with the bathroom towels and food for the morning are just stellar. Susan called me day of to see if I wanted an early check-in and also to confirm my muffin choice.
The decor is beautiful! Our favorite was sitting out in the private patio, drinking our morning coffee, or having an afternoon cocktail. Bob and Thomas George have thought of everything to make their guests comfortable and happy.
The garden is so peaceful and lovely in the morning where we had morning coffee. The local park/trails were explored daily and we even took the bikes out! The neighborhood is quiet with lots of people walking their dogs and saying hi to you.
Paul was a very responsive and helpful host from booking through to check out. Highly recommended!
The bed was wonderfully comfortable, full cable tv and a large and well-equipped bathroom. It's located a hop, skip and a jump from the beach and the Marina. We could not have been more pleased.
We enjoyed our stay at Cher Alexander's place! We did not meet Cher Alexander, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in direction were clear. Very happy with this experience!
Location was amazing and was very easy to access all of South Bay. Outdoor area was a nice touch. The room had everything we needed.
WOW! Paul's topographic point was better than advertised. Close to the beach, we rode the bikes everyday, nice amenities and great communication.
Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout.
The large amount of people were split between inside the house and outside near the bbq food truck we had. So much space to move around. No one was cramped.
I traveled with my mom and my kids and we were comfortable, delighted, and fell in love with the area. We can't wait to return!
This is one of the best properties we've stayed in for a few reasons: great location, value, quality of space and amenities provided. All the beach gear you need (bikes, boards, chairs, towels, toys - everything!) and a very well stocked kitchen (cooking oils, seasonings,  gadgets, etc).
Brian Burns offers some ear plugs though, so unless you're a light sleeper you should be all right . All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and I'd happily return. Thanks, Brian Burns!
Nina’s tiny home is making me re-evaluate my life choices. Maybe I need to downsize my large 4-bedroom home, into a tiny home? I love how broad everything is, and how comfortable and modern the loft and bathrooms are inside.
Next time we're down in the area, we'll definitely be checking availability here. If my 6'2" husband had been along with me, it would have been a bit too tight. But that being said, the guest register reflected that many other couples had stayed there and were perfectly comfortable.
Quick Communication Time and an even greater topographic point to stay. Paul also provided some snacks and beverages for out stay. Thanks for everything!
The kitchen offered so many amenities. One could stay there for quite awhile and be very comfortable and cheerful! The bathroom was nice too with a great shower head.
The little dainty and awesome tv options were great for evenings in with our little guy. Lastly, the fact that you picked us up a pack and play for our small guy to sleep was so so kind of you. Best host ever!
My dog Benson and I had a great stay at Teresa Knight's place! We were in town for a quick 36 hours for a wedding, and Teresa Knight was very accommodating with helping us check in a bit early. She even offered to let my dog out while I was at the wedding, and lent me a phone charger when I realized I forgot my own.
The backyard is quite charming as well. Would stay again!
We loved this topographical point . It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises.
And the bathtub!!! Thanks so much Lori Stewart:)
He goes beyond the average with amenities. Very easy to walk everywhere from here....we parked the car and never once moved it. We  thoroughly enjoyed our first Redondo experience.
We certainly needed a good rest and the pillow and linens were great. Not to make this sound cheesy, but Where do I begin, with how wonderful this bnb was!? This was our first bnb experience and I only hope all are as nice!
We had a wonderful stay at Edwin Green’s! It was easy to find as Edwin Green has a light up sign with the address. I was very impressed and grateful for the amenities provided such as the coffee/tea, fridge/microwave, and especially the bicycles, beach towels, and beach chairs to help us fit into and enjoy the local scene.
The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon. This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts.
However, we couldn't have been happier. The great pride that they take in their unit is evident from the comfy bed, array of towels, and personalized welcome message in the room. They really have thought of everything!
Angela's place was amazing, perfect location near the pier, restaurants and shopping. She provided thoughtful extra touches; wine, coffee, snacks, even brought us donuts one morning. Yum!
This is a return trip for us and we were unaware of some of the new kings in the area. We had a wonderful stay here for the two of us during a road trip through the southwest of the USA. Cher Alexander welcomed us unobtrusively but personally and gave us helpful tips for the place itself and beyond for our further journey.
Within walking distance of restaurants, grocery stores, cocktail lounges, beach, everything. Had such an amazing time at this air bnb. Lois Davis goes out of her way to make her guests feel welcome,  from fresh squeezed orange juice in the fridge to face masks in the bathroom.
On our last morning there, we had delicious crescent roll and lattes at Masse's, a little slice of Paris on Shattuck. We absolutely loved this little space that actually felt incredibly broad considering. The aesthetic was on point, it was clean, it was comfortable and it was in the perfect location.
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. Raquel Eastham’s place is also extremely close to the Golden Gate Park, the deYoung Museum, public transportation, and a wide variety of restaurants & supermarkets like Safeway on 48th & Fulton. We especially loved that it was only a couple of streets away from Ocean Beach and the dramatic Sea Cliff bluffs.
Stayed a night with my wife for a wedding at the historic Redondo Beach library, and we were able to walk to the venue within ten minutes. Very comfortable bed with simple, clean style, and Elizabeth provided some water upon our return following the reception. Would definitely stay here again.
Clearly, the home’s owner thought through everything that a guest might need. We arrived to find coffee and tea waiting, which was perfect after a long day of travel. The apartment is clean, spacious, well located and very, very comfortable.
Food around the neighbourhood was fantastic! We basically Uber wherever we go. Apartment is near the city and all the touristy places.
The bathroom and bedroom space were extremely clean and had everything we could have needed (anything from coffee, extra beach towels, sunblock, bottle opener, etc.). !
Man, it’s really hard to explain the amount of comfort, appreciation and hospitality that Brent provided. You would be lucky to stay at a place like his so book it if you see it, no need to second guess. I can’t wait to go back believe me when I say this guy went above and beyond and it was second to none!
I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. I would definitely stay with Sheri Vowell again the next time I'm in Virginia Beach!
Learned that the property was built in 1913 including the in law suite. Rayford Kelly goes out of her manner as a Host and genuinely cares about your experience. She has created a welcoming place and is always available.
We hit it off right away and even talked in kitchen for a while before I unloaded my car and got a tour of the house! Christopher Brown have a Big heart and really loves others around her! She even took the time to write out a drawn-out recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant spots were out of this universe !
I especially enjoy riding bikes and loved the trail! This is our second stay at Scott’s place. We highly recommend it!
We did Uber Pool a couple of times and it cost anywhere between $5-$7 one way to get downtown. We were in the city to see Hamilton, but also went to the Art Institute Chicago and ate dinner at the Blue Door. Their place was easy to travel to between all those places.
Particularly loved the wonderful light, windows and  design elements of the ceiling and inside . Christopher Brown was prompt and clear in all communications, and very warm and helpful at check-in and check-out, and in sharing some excellent tips for restaurants, coffee shops and neighborhood activities. We enjoyed every element of our stay at Christopher Brown's place and hope to be back again soon!
Our secret hideaway. Tammy and Marc make it fun and easy going.
We used Angela’s bungalow for our honeymoon and have zero regrets. Her bungalow was such a haven for us after a busy season of life and chaotic wedding planning. Angela thought of absolutely everything we could have needed.
We were “cool” from there. The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a motorcycle shop close by called Switching Gears. We rented a couple of bikes and rode thru the state park and to the boardwalk.
It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.
Kitchen with all the basic requirements. Heather’s apartment is full of detailed information on local restaurants etc. Washing and drying facilities on the property.
We loved this place. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly.
Beddings are 100% cotton. Hair and body care products are all great brands. And sparkling clean is not an adequate word to describe the bedroom and bathroom.
It was a pleasure to witness how much love is in their home. They have two loving pups that were so sweet. The room was as expected.
Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! Cozy and comfy! We loved our stay at Jeanna's, the place really felt like a home to us.
Jeanna's place is a 20-minute walk to the waterfront, and about a $10-$12 Lyft ride to downtown, where there are plenty of fun bars and restaurants to choose from. We would certainly consider coming back!
Had a great stay! Though I never met Marc in person, he was quick and clear with communication. Check-in was a breeze.
I was there during a heat wave and while there's no air conditioning, fans kept the rooms cool. cozy bedding,  flowers, treats, best yogurt, pastries, fresh blueberries, mango, on and on...and, as others have said, the carefully placed notes to inform, we loved the place, and could feel John Brashier care in wanting to make it all that a get away suite could possibly be. How great is that?!
The space itself is really a hidden gem tucked away behind a lovely garden for privacy and quiet. The loft was so unique and charming and they did a great occupation to maximize the space. It’s very functional but stylish.
i love her house. Staying at Jeremy Johnson’s place is an A+ experience. She offers warm hospitality, excellent accommodations, a superior location near the beach,  and off-street parking!
We also appreciated the provided coffee and to-go cups and the fridge/freezer combo. Lots of thoughtful touches. Great value for a place so close to everything!
The room is clean and big and the shower has the best water pressure I’ve ever felt! We enjoyed every minute of our stay here and would book again in a heart beat. Teresa Knight was extremely helpful with our early arrival, and had so many great tips on places to visit.
Angela’s apartment is a perfect base to explore San Francisco from, particularly the Mission district. This is a great place to stay if you’re visiting the city.
A good bed is always a must. We slept so well! The kitchen offered so many comforts .
The cottage is very comfortable and clean in a great location for visiting LA and the beach. And you could not ask for a better host! !
We loved the privacy of the location. Felt like home. You are only a 5-7 min walk to the L.  Bus transport is easily accessible.
Ceiling fan , air-conditioning n heater, t.v. washer/dryer. Walking distance to Kings Harbor, Whole Foods, and South Park nearby...... Over All a really nice topographic point to stay, Thanks Neva and Logan (her puppy) Petite Boutique !
This is a lovely, tranquil, very clean room in a quiet neighborhood of Berkeley. For me, it was within walking distance of the Downtown Berkeley BART and the north side of the UC Berkeley campus. You do have to walk uphill a bit to get to the place, so keep that in mind if you have luggage other than a backpack.
They would check on you to make sure everything you need to keep you comfort! Oh on behalf, I couldn’t live without their outdoor hot tub and mediated room! ❤️
We enjoyed every element of our stay at Diane's place and hope to be back again soon! The house is immaculate ! It looks way better than the photos.
Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. She has an excess refrigerator in the lower level for guests as well. The private bathroom, directly across the  hall from the bedroom, was very clean and convenient and included towels, soap and shampoo.
The space is furnished and decorated beautifully. It is filled with natural light and ocean air. While we were settling in, a couple of furry friends came and said hello to us and that put us in such a great mood.
We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.
Shantell Preusser’s place is 2 blocks from the beach and about a 5 minute walk from the downtown Hermosa area. The room has a private entrance so you can easily come and go and have your own space. It was a perfect location for a long weekend in LA on the beach!
I come occasionally to visit and this time I brought a friend with me. So crashing on the couch at my uncles place wasnt an option this time. This place was amazing!
A couple things to note are that it is nice they provide bicycles,  just know that they are older. One great thing about this area is the bike way on the beach that goes all the way to Santa Monica. There are 2 rental topographic point close by.
This was the perfect place for us to stay in while in town for a family reunion. We checked in with a lockbox, but given our own key. It was not a problem to come and go as we pleased.
It felt very secluded and quiet, but was just ~15 minutes driving from downtown Vashon. It was a nice walk down the rocky beach to the lighthouse. It would be absolutely perfect for a romantic couple of days with a loved one...winter (drinking hot drinks, watching the storms over the water) or summer (enjoying the sunshine, walking on the beach).
Neva’s Petite Boutique was exactly as stated in her description. Neighborhood was quiet. Those who are worried about dog .
The best part about staying here is difficult to choose. Louise was great--she was very responsive and respectfully available if you need anything. She also went above and beyond to provide local tip --her guidebook was amazing.
Wonderful and quiet location! Check in/check out was very quick and easy. The room was clean with plenty of towels.
Fell asleep in an instant it was so comfortable . Both were within a short distance from the guest house and I highly recommend. Stop searching and book this place!
I was the only person in the apartment which was all right ; good for a few days stay. Having the refrigerator and microwave was handy. I had no issue with street noise as some other renters commented.
Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. The neighborhood is quiet but also close to shopping. A 20 min.
The location is minutes from the expressway , UPS, old town Tacoma and Ruston Way. The location is perfect for getting to town and other neighborhoods, and Joan Litwin offered excellent recommendations for seeing Puget Sound and checking out the local menu . The home was more than comfortable, clean, and filled with everything you could imagine needing for a stay.
After staying there for 6 nights I highly recommend this location. My father was so satisfied that while staying there he booked another trip to stay at the cottage for 7 night . Once again, I wanted to thank Heather for everything and for making our trip memorable.
This is a great apartment. It's super clean and comfortable, feels very private, and came stocked with breakfast items, extra tolitries, and sparkling water, all which were great touches. We enjoyed the patio/yard area.
This is the perfect place to stay in Hermosa Beach! Check-in was a breeze, the place was spotless and had lots of great amenities, allowing you to pack light! The bikes and beach gear were the perfect touch, being just a block and a one-half from the strand.
(Which I prefer. My wife prefers a softer bed, but she says it was comfortable enough, and she slept well.) Multiple pillow options too.
Cher Alexander’s place was perfect for our stay. It is located very close to adorable shops and restaurants. There was bottled water, coffee, and tea which was wonderful .
She couldn’t be more friendly and polite! Alameda itself has lovely character and a great variety of restaurants and shops with a small town feel! We definitely recommend staying with Lia and Gregg in their sunny, cozy, clean apt.
Maggie & John are so wonderful and accommodating! We were arriving early and Maggie was kind enough to make sure we’d be able to check in by the time we get there. THE DETAILS were everything.
Absolutely perfect for my needs. (Damn... gonna be hard for me to get a booking now after this review. )
The metro line into Manhattan is just a 15 minute walk away. Great place to stay!
Brenda is more than accommodating. The room I stayed in was perfect for the solo traveler. Sheets were clean, towels provided and the WiFi worked great.
All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and I'd happily return. This place is PHENOMENAL!!! Words can't describe how lovely having a glass of wine on the patio in bloom is while surrounded by the incredible sights and sounds of the city!
The area around the location has many restaurants and is safe. Brenda’s place is the perfect location for a single person. The value is unbeatable, especially compared to other places (Airbnbs/hotels alike) in San Francisco.
He worked hard to make certain April and I had everything that we needed, which exceeded our expectations. Crystal Romero spoke to April and I to see what our interests were in food and entertainment then proceeded to make suggestions for food in the Mission District, as well as other places around San Francisco. Our main reason for visiting the area was to attend an Oakland Raiders game.
Thoroughly enjoyed this property! The owners provided local tip and timely communications before and during our stay.
Scott and Jill are wonderful hosts who worked extremely responsively with us as our scheduled arrival changed. They helped us figure out some of the neighborhoods we were looking for an apartment, gave us some tips on cool places to eat, and introduced us to their sweet doggo, Bonnie. Their garage loft is a lovely, very clean space in a very quiet vicinity .
The place is conveniently located and the bikes she provides are a great manner to get around town. I’m surprised that this place isn’t solid booked for years in advance. Such a perfect location and a awesome place to stay and relax.
Very cute and well decorated home in a quite nice vicinity ! I like everything during my stay and very grateful of lots of little things that prepared by the host!
We had brought chargers for our phones, but those were also provided right beside the bed. It was the type of airbnb where you truly did not need to bring anything. We showed up earlier then check in time so Tyler was great about letting us leave our stuff while we went to go explore San Francisco.
Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! It was so far the best air bnb experience we had. The place is comfortable and very clean.
Lindsay Brown provided excellent communication and high end bedding and mattress. You will enjoy her place as a base for exploring!
We enjoyed our stay at Rod's topographic point ! The pictures are accurate, and the view is truly amazing. The apartment was clean, and we loved the amenities such as the outdoor pool, the game room with pool table, the gym, and the roof deck where we could see the Navy Pier fireworks in the distance.
The modern, stylish touches made me feel like I wasn’t in a a posh hotel! Lori Stewart’s apartment is a perfect base to explore San Francisco from, particularly the Mission district. There’s loads and loads of great restaurants, cafes and coffee shops within walking distance from the flat, you could spend several days just exploring the local area.
They absolutely loved it. It’s very open and airy with lots of light. We spent time on the porch drinking coffee and enjoying the sun.
It's conveniently located to everything and super charming. Definitely grab this place if you can!
This suite was..  sweet! The lockbox was an excellent idea, I’ve never seen anything like that before. It made checking in a breeze.
If you want a private escape with a private pool and hot tub with a beautiful serene 3 acre setting to view from your second story deck - Edwin Green is the place to be! What more could you ask for. This was our first AirBNB experience and I have to say, I think we stumbled on the best of the best.
But obviously it has. And it should for hosts that deserve to be successful for their efforts. For good reason.
Staying here was like being at home. Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated with a private bathroom. To enter in the house and in the bedroom you use a key pad, which made us feel secured.
Austin and Star were accommodating from the beginning. We were driving from Lehigh Valley, PA., and knew we would get in a lot sooner than the 3 PM check-in. Star allowed us to check in earlier upon our arrival.
The space itself is really a hidden gem tucked away behind a lovely garden for privacy and quiet. The loft was so unique and charming and they did a great job to maximize the space. It’s very functional but stylish.
The suite is amaizing and I have no words to describe the bathroom! I had not the opportunity to meet Shantell Preusser, however my partner did it. She was very nice and helpful.
Danny runs a great place and is clearly an experienced host who has learned the needs and wants of his guests. We met some nice people there and enjoyed our conversation. He also stocks the kitchen with some breakfast items like breads, English muffins, pastries and cereal , not to mention plenty of coffee.
Who wouldn’t like that?) Thank you Michelle!
Their place is truly a respite. I certainly was not surprised to just learn that Chuck's home was featured in Reader's Digest as a top airbnb in the state Virginia. An absolute gem of a place!
Lastly, Charlotte was a little love to have around! Thank you, Rayford Kelly and Charlotte, for providing your amazing home as a wedding venue. We hope to see you again soon!
This apartment, although small, was perfect for our purposes. This cozy, quiet and clean living space is top notch. Separate, private entrance with private seating area and space for bikes, boogie boards and more.
The space was super cute and also had everything you needed for an extended stay. Extremely clean and the host was very quick to respond/help with anything. The motorcycle they supplied were our favorite.
Plenty of towels, blankets, and sheets. And the bed...I had the most restful sleep I've had in months! We were bummed to be only staying for the weekend and definitely will be back.
Hosts are super responsive and work hard to make your stay great. I highly recommend Proctor Cottage! I chose the place because of the reviews and the picture .
Chuck is available and close by, yet you feel like you have the house alone. He is patient, warm, kind and shares the history of his home. Our child loved all the details, the swing outside, the popcorn machine and being greeted by Charlotte, the dog.
It was so cleanly,  impeccably designed, welcoming, private, and warm-we lacked nothing and only 2 block from beach! This was a particular time for us. Thank you for making it possible!
We loved this place! Robert Huckabaa was really easy to chat to and let us check in early and leave our bags late so we didn’t have to carry our bags around. Check in was super simple.
This was my second time using Air Bnb and my mother’s first and we both absolutely loved the Cozzy Cottage experience! We traveled all the way from New Jersey and this topographical point literally felt like our home away from home. The vicinity is super cute and most important, very safe.
I had not the opportunity to meet Kelly, however my partner did it. I fully recommend it!
Heather's place has been by far the best Air BnB experience to date! Her apartment was beautifully kept and furnished and located in a great part of town - just slightly away from the hustle & bustle but a quick muni ride into all the action which made it a perfect home base for exploring the city. The apartment itself, check-in procedure and comforts provided by Heather were all amazing and definitely above and beyond what I would normally expect.
This time we wanted something more cost effective, more homey, and a kitchen to prepare meals. I was so taken with the photos, description of Melia's casita, and reviews that I did not hesitate to book, even though it was across the bridge and would be a drive to SF. Our son was able to spend a few nights with us and we all enjoyed some home cooked meals....prepared with fresh herbs from Melia's garden!
Jeni’s condo was a true oasis! The view from the back bedroom was priceless - Mount Rainer in all its glory and sparkling city lights overlooking the Sound... This was truly an exceptional Airbnb experience, and one we hope to return to any time we are in the Seattle / Tacoma area.
Heather's Cozy Cottage is wonderful! Secondly, the bed is very comfortable. Both my husband and I have struggled with the quality of bed in AirBnb experience in the past, but this bungalow is comfortable for us.
Thank you again! Amazing beach cottage! Great location in Redondo Beach, super convenient with really great bikes to get around in, we loved beach able to bike along beach bike paved trails to explore Redondo and adjacent beach towns Hermosa and Manhattan.
Super cunning , stylish, and clean. She was quick to reply when we had question . The only thing I want to note is if you’re new to NYC this location is about 20-40 minutes Uber from most of the site seeing we did.
Elizabeth’s place is everything you want in a stay away from home. The private room is very large and comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the sea breeze from the balcony.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. Very highly recommended! I have stayed in lots of Airbnb’s and this is one of the best.
Clean, cozy, comfortable (if you are willing to navigate a tight staircase a few times each day). Great mattress on the bed. Nice shared back yard with main dwelling - we sat with a glass of wine awaiting the rain and watching the birds.
The pillows were as comfortable as any hotel I’ve stayed at, and the beds and sofa were great too. PLUS, Debra Dibble and Michael Krieg were super responsive from check-in to check-out, and gave us great recommendations. They couldn’t have been better hosts.
A truly unique space, rustic yet urbane, with every detail you could think of - even the outdoor shower was quaint and cozy . Listening to live jam sessions was an added bonus! We felt right at home, and we were glad to have taken a friend’s recommendation to book this location.
Location is seriously second to none. One block from the Thomas George which you’re going to want to use as parking everywhere else is rough. Just a few block from the beach and Golden Gate Park.
Staying at Jose’s was magnificent. The apartment is very clean, stylish & perfect for a getaway! Jose accommodated my family in every way possible, from letting us check in early, drove us to our event we were in town for & gave great suggestions of topographic point to visit, eat & easiest ways to get around Chicago.
I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list. Loved the extra blankets to snuggle up on the couch. TV is HUGH!
We would definitely stay there again. The place is great! The location is amazing, it is a short walk to Redondo beach pier, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, and a number of restaurants.
It’s located on a quiet street, and we had plenty of fresh towels, blankets, coffee — pretty much everything necessary — and more — to make our holiday visit perfect. Our bed was comfortable, and  the hide-a-bed my daughter slept on was also comfortable! A pleasant surprise, since most fold outs are mini torture devices!
The bed is very comfortable, with lovely, high end sheets to sink into. All in all, we enjoyed a truly wonderful stay and highly recommend Zeena's home!
This small beach cottage worked great for my wife and I with our two small child ! Very great location near the beach and restaurants and also very clean and nice! We enjoyed our time here and look forward to coming back again soon.
Jo made every adjustment we had asked for and then some. She provided very clean and welcoming atmosphere. She even had coffee ready to be made in the morning and breakfast.
I was made to feel completely at home, being offered a bath with some yummy bath salts, and full access to her gorgeous kitchen and everything it had to offer. I really enjoyed my stay at Christina’s topographic point . She made it felt just like home.
My family and I had a fantastic experience at The Carriage house. Brent was very helpful with responding to our questions in a timely manner. We enjoyed  the close proximity to the beach.
She provided many tips in an information packet about what to do, where to eat/ drink, and what locals would do. Angela's place has so many sweet touches, like light breakfast options, coffee, and bottled water. For our honeymoon, she even left us a bottle of prosecco in the fridge!
It was in a good location with easy access to San francisco and points north. Every part of this little studio has a special touch from handmade curtains and down bedding. We arrived to a fresh baguette on the counter and milk in the fridge for our coffee.
Pamela Drew was so warm and also helped us with our bags. The photos of this topographic point do not do justice to how lovely, warm and full of thoughtful touches it is. A big plus for me was the private washroom which was not only sparkling clean and extremely spacious but also full of all amenities one would need.
Overall I enjoyed my stay and I’d definitely stay there again if I find myself out in SF as a single lady again in the near future. My first trip to San Francisco would not have been the same if I had stayed anywhere but Brenda’s. “Perfectly located” is not an understatement- her house is in the middle of the Castro and walking distance to fantastic nightlife and food.
The loft was absolutely spotless, beautifully and tastefully furnished, and really fun (games, puzzles, pool table, music, and even a scooter!) Well located for business district Tacoma, the Glass Museum, and Point Defiance Park. This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud.
From the very start Bob and Sharann were warm and welcoming. They even checked in before going out of town for a couple days to see if we needed anything before they left. The accommodation was so much nice than we expected!
He was very generous in his offer to let us keep our belongings with him for safekeeping while we explored the area for the day, well past our checkout time. I’ll consider this my small motley -à-terre from now on, and can’t thank the host(s) enough for their kindness and hospitality! It checks all the boxes and then some.
The littles extras such as coffee, homemade bread and jam and fruit was a lovely touch to making us feel comfortable in their home. There’s enough space to hang up your apparel , we didn’t need lots of space so the room size was perfect for us. A MUST is to catch the ferry from Oakland Ferry Port to San Francisco Bay Ferry Building or Pier 41.
I felt very cosy and safe in the beach style, clean and well presented AirBnb. Best Airbnb that I have ever stayed in, mostly due to the owner and her ability to be an amazing host. 100 stars !
Now. I can’t tell you enough how thankful we are.
Wonderful hosts, awesome location! Amy and Dennis were lovely hosts, and their cabin location is nothing short of amazing. We felt like we were in a cabin oasis, with the city laid out just beyond the gate.
The cottage is at the back of the yard, so be aware you don't have an expansive view of the sound from inside the cottage. As you look out at the water, the main house is on the left and a boundary hedge is on the right. You do have access to the beach, however.
Wouldn't hesitate to book it again!! Thank you Troy and Attina for making our honeymoon trip starts so wonderfully!! Vic & Gen
We loved this topographic point ! It has everything you need from lotion to shampoo, coffee, chocolates on the pillows and Bennie Dudgeon. We felt very much at home.
He even has a shampoo/conditioner/body wash console in the shower. I am pretty picky about my accommodations and I am 200% satisfied with my stay at Paul's guesthouse. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
I had a short and sweet stay at Elizabeth's place. She was a wonderful host, prompt with all the responses, and gave very detailed instructions. The bedroom and bathrooms were spacious and clean.
We had an amazing stay at Tiana’s place. Check in was very easy and Tiana allowed us to check in early. She also kept checking on us making sure we had fresh towels, water bottles etc.
Dennis Steward and Traci's place was a wonderful place to stay while visiting Berkeley. The room is cozy and gorgeous. It is snug for two, but we were comfortable; all the built ins and storage nooks and charging corners made it a pleasure, and the view is unparalleled.
First for me to sleep on one, and it was quite different. Not necessary uncomfortable but unfamiliar for someone who has never slept on one. There was miscommunication on check-out time.
Great place to stay in Hermosa Beach. Very clean and perfect location only 2 blocks from the beach. Although the owner live upstairs this is private with it’s own entrance.
Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). Highly recommend this place! Also, I just noticed Joelle offers a larger space, which is just as beautiful.
Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach. However, what makes our experience way too memorable and extraordinary is the personal touch that Melissa adds in terms of extra amenities, tips, recommendations etc. In our case, she was very kind and thoughtful to let us know about her bikes, beach chairs etc.
 fringe benefit provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! They provide you with everything you could wish for: coffee, beach towels, beach bag, residental parking ticket (!!! ), bikes,  beach chairs etc..
Lori Stewart’s place was excellent and I would highly recommend it for 2-3 adult size people or 2 adults and 2 small children. It was a short few minute walk to the beach and it was so nice to have a dedicated parking spot. Lori Stewart was very helpful and very responsive to all our questions.
We loved our stay at Lois Davis's place and would highly recommend this rental. We will book again with Rayford Kelly’s topographic point when we return to the Bay Area for a long weekend getaway in the future. Thankful that we had a wonderful & pleasant stay at Rayford Kelly’s place.
Will be back. We booked their place for a BFF reunion with our 14 year old daughters #girlsonly. The Beach Cottage is the perfect place for a couple or family to stay.
Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 minute away (at the bottom of the hill). Definitely would stay again
Maggie & John are so wonderful and accommodating! We checked in with Maggie and she said it was ok to leave it in our unit in the meantime! Best host or what!
The room was spacious, very open and clean and perfect for two people. There were great amenities in the room, including a mini fridge, television , cutter and cups as well as other helpful guides. The bathroom is stunning and extremely clean with many amenities provided too.
We did have a full Oakland day as well, both in the immediate neighbourhood of the house as well as surrounding neighbourhoods, and another morning where we went to the awesome Grand Lake Farmer's Market, a short walk from the house. I hope to return again one day, big thank you to our hosts! !
Teresa Knight's place was immaculate , very cozy and made us feel like home. I can't be more thankful for chosing Teresa Knight's topographic point for our vacation. Also I have to say that the communication with him was above expectations since we went there a week after the hurricane John Brashier and I was so worried about the weather and the beach, but Teresa Knight was honest and so helpful answering to all my questions.
:) The rooms are light, bright, and spacious. Otherwise, things could not have been more perfect. I  would ecourage anyone to stay there and I plan to use Jo's again when visiting Seattle!
We loved this spot! We would definitely recommend this place!
But don't let that stop you from booking this gem! The extras touches were so fantastic! Fresh flowers, paper and markers for doodling, games, cold drinking water, coffee & CREAM!
Alfred’s restaurant across the street was an easy option for breakfast. Debra Dibble and Hillary's place is a great topographic point stay if you're visiting the Tacoma area. Pictures accurately show the loft, and you won't be disappointed with the space.
We could have had fresh brewed coffee with creamer in the home and taken advantage of the provided bite , but we decided to wander in the morning. It wasn’t clear to me from the write up, but there is a stacked washer and dryer in the home. Gloria was an awesome host.
Traci is a professional chef, and she leaves out breakfast options that make 'continental' blush. They're often around for suggestions, recommendations, and local knowledge. I would have liked to stay longer!
A beautiful topographic point very clean and everything you need. I highly recommend this fantastic coastal bungalow . Thank you Tiana!
Comfortable everything. During check in, I dropped part of the key's lock box off the deck and into the neighbor's yard. I contact Tony and Anita to ask what I should do.
We were bummed to be only staying for the weekend and definitely will be back. Thanks Sierra!
The cottage has everything you need to feel immediately at home, check in and check out a breeze, great food in walking distance, and the beautiful beach steps away — I woke up to the sound of crashing waves every morning. Thank you, T, for a fantastic , restful stay. Can’t wait to return!
Very clean, high tech room with a super comfy bed, really nice shower. Although we didn’t really use the shared space  we checked it out and it is lovely with dramatic views of the city. Only possible drawback for some guests is that the stairs are quite steep and numerous so carrying a large or heavy suitcase could be a challenge.
The apartment doesn't only have a great location, it was sparkling clean and had a great beach house vibe to it. Information provided some great recommendations for local places to eat at. There's also a outdoor shower to wash off all the sand, and a garden deck area to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or an evening read.
Great resto recommendation! This space is a perfect little place right near the beach. We could walk easily there and it was in walking distance to the pier where there are lots of yummy food options.
The space provided was beyond comfortable, and Jeremy Johnson communication was excellent! Definitely great for a morning stroll before heading to the beach. Additionally the neighborhood is also extremely close to an assortment of restaurant and other entertainment outside of just the beach.
Beautiful trees and flowers everywhere. Igor is very nice and helpful. Very nice person that helps him.
My expectations were exceeded by Gregory Simons thoughtful touch . What really solidified my confidence in staying in this home was Gregory Simons hospitality. She was so welcoming and made our brief stay so wonderful.
So we shortened our stay in San Fran. I live in SF and got this topographic point for my parent when they were visiting. They absolutely loved it.
We especially appreciated using the bikes to ride along the beach in the morning. After a long drive, it was nice to be able to unwind in the room before going out. I would absolutely recommend these living quarters !
The only thing I can complain about is not having enough time to enjoy this space to the fullest, since I was in town for a work event and had to leave at 7 the next morning. Growing up in Seattle we laughed at Tacoma and while it's true that the "aroma of Tacoma" still wafts about in the sea air the city itself has been quietly reinventing itself for the better part of a decade. Having NOT torn down its old buildings, the visitor is now treated to a thriving creative laboratory housed in weird cool surroundings.
Great location. Loads of comforts . We didn't want to leave!
You NEED to stay ( web site hidden by Airbnb) is simply beautiful...! We stayed at Maggies place for a week during Halloween period. The place is really great, first of all very quite neighborhood no noise in late/night hours.
Thank you Christiana, and thank you for checking in with me to make sure everything was alright, and asking if I had everything I needed. This is my second time staying at this lovely studio conveniently located in Old Town, just a short stroll to three awesome breakfast coffee places, and The Spar for dinner! The view of Commencement Bay from the studio, the comfortable bed , furnishings and HD television, the thoughtful bite all create a lovely experience in this clean, efficient studio.
Great location with easy distance to tons of restaurants & activities. Overall great stay and highly recommend! !
Awesome location! 20 minutes from LAX. Walking distance to convenient stores and multiple restaurants.
Angela’s place was really special—beautiful decor, comfortable, very clean. She thought of everything, even having coffee and adult beverages available, motorcycle , and fresh fruit. There was even a luxurious new mattress which was so comfortable.
The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. A very unique concept for an Airbnb and we loved it. The idea of a living space within a home completely secluded from the main housing is something that catches the eye and this place does not fail to impress.
The area is very lovely to walk around and convenient too. This topographic point was absolutely wonderful. We stayed here for a weekend to attend a wedding on Vashon and it was an easy 10-15 minute drive to the venue on the south side of the island.
Looking forward to visiting again. We had a FAB weekend.
Elizabeth Jones and Mitch This is a perfect location for a stay in downtown Tacoma. It is convenient to shops and restaurant .
Marcos Blount is very sweet and she always asked if I needed anything. The second day, she offered croissants and they were delightful ! She also has bagels in the fridge as well as eggs.
Linda and Mike are amazing. The space is just as described and although the bathroom is at bottom of the stairs it’s not shared and is super easy to get to/from....There is plenty of privacy at that end of the house due to the floor plan/lay out so it doesn’t feel (Website hidden by Airbnb) perfect. The location is at the end of a road so there is privacy, easy parking and it’s easy to come and go without feeling like you are bothering the hosts or the neighbors.
My husband and I were inspired by this space, with its simplicity and aesthetic. Affordable, lovely, and relaxing. The host were attentive and kind.
 amazing job with a book of "things to do" to include restaurant and places to see. Highly recommend Ms Heather and the Cozy Cottage.
There is a band named "Charming Hostess" that is related to the music I heard -- they were not present that night, but their title was instead ably filled by Zeena. Zeena is the hostess with the mostest! She is very attentive to details, and offers a gourmet breakfast every morning.
Amazing deal and great stay. The house is very modern and the nicest one on the block! The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area.
The Carriage House is the PERFECT spot for a beach getaway! The space was immaculate and stylish, and the keypad check-in was a breeze - Brent even accommodated an early check-in for me since I was already in town on business. Everything you could hope for and more was provided- soft towels and linens, a stocked Keurig/coffee pods, snacks and wine, games, and a beach bag.
Other notes, idk how to set up the wii but it’s okay because I enjoyed tv instead. Zeena and her husband, Arthur Paddick, have a beautiful home and were very gracious host . My wife and I actually had just gotten married and were coming in fairly late from our reception.
Beautiful neighborhood. More than I expected. Beautiful trees and flowers everywhere.
Check in was simple and you can do so any time since it's a self-check-in process. It was a short walk up to Bernal Heights Park to get a pretty cool view of the city, though quite a distance from the city center - but nothing an Uber or Lyft can't help with! Angela was kind enough to let me keep my luggages at her place after check out since my flight wasn't till the evening, and it was great to have a place to change to more comfortable clothes for my long flight ahead.
They really are super hosts. Absolutely perfect for my need . Highly recommend this place for sure.
We did not meet Rod, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in directions were clear. Danielle's place is very roomy, clean, and comfortable to stay in. Everything you need is in her place even a washing machine and dryer.
I highly recommend his place... Gregory Simons was a great host and my boyfriend and I had a great stay in Redondo! We didn’t stay in the house a whole lot, but there was a view of the ocean from the bedroom window, a large bathroom (which included a towel warmer), and had full access to the rest of the house if needed.
Definitely cannot wait to return and stay here again! We had a great stay! Liz’s home is beautiful, spotless, and comfortable, and it’s located just a few blocks from beach.
Would definitely consider staying here again the following time we’re in LA. Highly recommend!
T's place was perfect for our mother-daughter getaway. T was so amazingly thoughtful, thorough, and responsive from pre-checkin, to parking, to checkout. It was so cleanly,  impeccably designed, welcoming, private, and warm-we lacked nothing and only 2 blocks from beach!
! I cozied up in one with some tea watching Eternal Sunshine on the couch, my friend and my favorite movie ever! They have it!
We drove to the places we needed to go so I am not sure if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops. So if you need privacy in the bathroom you have to ask your traveling companion to leave the bedroom. And like the description says there are a couple of steep stair cases.
Clean place is a lovely upscale neighbourhood. You can take a bus to the subway or enjoy a lovely walk through the upscale neighbourhood. I’d say it’s about 15 min and then a quick drive on the E train to Manhattan.
The great pride that they take in their unit is apparent from the comfy bed, array of towels, and personalized welcome message in the room. They were also such gracious hosts--they gave us a lovely history of the area, had brochures from local restaurants, and even little mints on the bed side stand. Would highly recommend
When we first got there, we found post-it notes all around the place with instructions that made it easy to settle in. She provided us with breakfast (yogurt and granola), tea, coffee and fruits! A really nice touch.
I have stayed at Airbnbs all over the world but this room has been by far the best. Will definitely stay at again next time I am in SF. Thanks Tyler!
I stayed here with a friend during a short stint in SF for a conference. It's a lovely apartment with all the amenities you would need to enjoy your stay. The place is clean, comfortable and very charming.
Stayed at this place to surprise my boyfriend for our anniversary and he was blown away by how gorgeous and spacious the loft was! The theme and decor are very stylish and Gloria keeps everything clean and tidy, and the house rules are straight to the point. The loft is located in a great spot because events, activities, and restaurants in Tacoma are a short walk or short drive/Lyft away.
Loved the small touches like the postcards in the rack. I phoned my family every other day. But, there was coffee, beers in the fridge, coffee maker, noodle pots, etc, all there on arrival.
And book. I just spend three nights at Shipwatch for a personal retreat and I feel so refreshed and rejuvenated. The location is great for walks and getting to the beach.
A true godsend when you are many miles from home! Hurricane Matthew had left branches and debris all over the yard and when I showed up to check in (early) Roberta Hallenbeck was already taking care of it to make sure the yard was perfect for our wedding! If you are thinking about a place to have an event, or even a place to get away you’ve found it!
Just note that if the snow is ever really bad during your stay, that it can be a bit difficult to get in/out of the parking area.. The area is definitely a mix of lower to mid income residents and students. With plenty of funky, high end, hipster spots.
There was a full fridge, microwave, toaster oven, hot plate for cooking, plenty of dishes for eating. The bed was super comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and warm blankets. The highlight of our trip, for certain .
with plenty of space. First of all, as a host, Justin couldn't be kinder or more helpful with suggestions and answers to any and all questions. The private room is absolutely lovely.
This is a such a quaint little spot nestled in an area that has so much to offer via walking distance and within a short drive. I'm a light sleeper and had no problem getting an awesome night rest after a show. tons of really great thoughtful touches in the room that made it feel homey that I don't usually see in many other places.
This space was such a great oasis in the midst of the Oakland. So close to our relatives place, this space is very chic with some thoughtful touches and a relaxed vibe. They have a mini fridge for your needs that they so generously filled with some fluid dainty .
We had an great experience! Everything we needed was there from hangers to coffee to Qtips (an added bonus!) Tiana checked in with us mid-stay to ensure everything was going great.
The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!
While we found it too far to walk down to the waterfront, we were able to explore the whole downtown and university area on foot. BTW, although a lot of the restaurants were closed when we went out for dinner (Monday night), we fell in love with the patio area at Jupiter and their salads were amazing. All in all, Leslie's space was a great choice for us from which to explore Berkeley, and Leslie has done a great job creating a very livable and welcoming space for guests!
And there were ample towels, toiletries, and plateware to be found. I literally rolled in with my suitcase and I was home. If I were to make any change, it would be the small addition of having more blankets or comforters available.
Check-in was a breeze, the place was spotless and had lots of great amenities, allowing you to pack light! Would definitely stay again on our following visit!
Great views of Oakland docks and a different view of San Francisco Bay including travelling under the Bay Bridge. and the house was gorgeous - the photos definitely do not do it justice. The space was large and beautiful; you can tell Christian has many artistic bones in his body because the house is beautifully and boldly decorated (loved the art and the dinosaurs!).
This was my first airbnb experience and I would absolutely visit their home again if I am back in Tacoma. Beautiful home with many amenities! The back yard is incredible: well groomed and taken care of.
If you want a quiet beach vacation or long weekend, this is an excellent choice. Chuck even provided an abundant bowl of candy in each room, I found this inspired. The home is convenient to the VB and Norfolk area to get to the beach, restaurants and local attractions.
And we had plenty of room in the space to spread out! The biggest plus was the free parking. Leo and Alex were gracious enough to allow us to use the lot a bit early, before check in, and a bit later, after check out.
There are even hummingbird feeders right outside the window which make for the most cheerful view. We had the best stay at Marcia's beautiful studio! You can tell she puts a lot of thought into her guests' visit .
They have 2 sweet pooches who are out on the shared patio at times. There is a privacy curtain for the sliding door/window entrance so don't worry about any exposure. Overall, nice folks, nice place, nice area, nice time.
Very cute place with nice garden area right outside the French doors of your room. Really nice designer bathroom, However might be a tighter squeeze in the toilet area, for a very tall person, unless you sit sideways ! Ceiling fan , air-conditioning n heater, t.v.
Thank you Troy and Attina for making our honeymoon trip starts so wonderfully!! Luke was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The bed is very comfortable and a thoughtful variety of pillows, from softer to firm.
This place was perfect for our one night stay! Also, her dog Luis Hawkins was a major highlight. So sweet!!
Cher Alexander’s home was our first Airbnb experience. Everything was so comfortable and at the end of a long day exploring we came home early just to rest in what was quite possibly one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever been in. Thanks Cher Alexander!
We had a great time at Neva's place. We especially loved the little puppy who came to greet us every time we left the building or returned!
My partner and I stayed in the in-law suite for 2 night and felt very welcome from the moment we arrived. Ian and Tenzing have created a lovely space for visitors to stay in and ensured that privacy was maintained at all times. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the telly even had a Erik Dickson subscription which was a really nice touch.
- Amenities are spot on. Close to public transport and found free street parking close by. We also loved having the 7-Eleven right below us!
He has a lovely terrace filled with flowers, which was a perfect place to relax. He also gave us some great recommendation for lesser-known sites to see in the city.
This is one of the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. For me it's all about the vibe, the amenities, and the location. This place gets bonus points for the vibe.
The place is beautiful. It’s always great to encounter good people. The place is walking distance to many delicious restaurant , bars and even the beach path.
Wonderful hosts and very comfortable guest suite in Noe Valley. It was sparkling clean and stocked with everything you’d need from keurig coffee and granola bars to maps and information about the city. Jeff and Peg were always quick to respond to messages and were very accommodating the entire stay.
After long days out in the city we enjoyed being able to cuddle up on the couch and stream some movies. Thank you!
Linda's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit bizarre , quiet, & "comfy". We decided to visit Tacoma from nearby Seattle and Brian and Hillary's loft was the perfect home base for exploring this up-and-coming city. The loft was very spacious, comfortable and surprisingly quiet for being so close to the ports and trains.
We have stayed in many 5 star hotels, and it is right up there with them. The decor is beautiful! The bed is comfortable, and there are so many extra touches, such as the basket of goodies, coffee maker, microwave,  and mini fridge.
The living room furniture is comfortable, both of us ended up dozing on the love seat during our stay. WiFi coverage is good. Overall, our experience was excellent, and we would gladly stay here again!
Thank you, Chuck and Charlotte, for providing your amazing home as a wedding venue. Chuck was the epitome of an extraordinary host! He was flexible with our arrangements and offered to assist us in every way possible before, during, and after our event.
I can’t recommend this topographic point enough! We felt super lucky to have found this topographic point ! Thank you for hosting us!
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. However when we met Tyler, he welcomed us so nicely and provided us with a lot of tips on where to eat and what to do. The place itself is nothing short of amazing.
She messaged a couple days prior to update us on our early check in request, checked in with us after we arrived to make sure we were able to settle in and to see if we needed anything. If my travel bring me back to the area, I will most certainly look to rebook here!
(next to Tacomas Community College) It was super confortable and there were many reachable super markets like Miranda Malone just 5 minutes away by walking. Heather gave us a very lovely welcome and she gave us many information about things to do in Tacoma. She was super kind and always there for Questions or help.
The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a bike shop close by called Switching Gears. The house itself was very quaint and cute and stocked with anything you could need. The biggest plus would have to be a basked packed full with lemurs from amazing local dining options.
Not sure if the hosts leave their house whenever they have guests but you do have to enter the host’s chief house in order to get to your place downstairs, so that’s a little weird. Luke is prompt to communicate - super helpful when arriving after dark and it's hard to the see the house numbers in the neighborhood. At Luke's place, you get the entire basement so you won't feel cramped at all.
We are absolutely charmed by Jenny & Mark's wonderful unit. The best Airbnb we had stayed so far! We loved everything here, from your hospitality, attention to details, the unit location that is few minutes walk to Ashby bart station, the extra personal touch like complimentary basic food for guests,...... the list goes on.
Safe and quiet neighborhood. Would definitely stay there again.
The picturesque location is perfect! The stairs, while noted are steep, aren’t that bad coming from two people who are overpackers. It’s well worth the climb when you see this amazing loft!
Brian Burns home was amazing ! it's a great place to stay if you will go near LA since it's not so far away. Also the the beach is minutes away.
You could walk to a place to eat or down to the beach. The neighborhood is beautiful. The guest house is lovely.
The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long skinny window to see out to the BBQ area. The cottage is on a quiet, remote road, but is only about 15 minutes from the main downtown part of Vashon. Chip was very available and responsive and sweet Olive the dog is eager for a pet if you want to call her over.
Great place to stay for anyone visiting LA. Beach bikes available to use, clean space, newly remodeled and stylish, mini fridge and coffee maker in the space. Easy check in and check out.
Incredible design, and extremely comfortable. The area is very safe, with lots of parking, and many things within walking distance. James Walker and Robert Turpen were quick to respond and communication was clear and precise.
She is so lovely and friendly everyday. She helped us with everything she can. The house is small but cozy.
:) Thanks again! The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous.
Would gladly stay again! The sunrises and sunsets are colorful bookends to anyone’s day. Their communication is excellent and we even lost power for an hour or two and they were quick to let me know of its return.
We visited family in Lakewood, which only took about a fifteen minute drive and then we went out to dinner on the other side of Tacoma and that was only a ten minute drive. We will definitely come back and stay at this cozy cottage!! Thank you Heather!!
We enjoyed the bikes she provides as well. Angela has been a very caring, responsive and friendly host. The place is perfectly located close to the beaches but also close to restaurants and supermarkets.
I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. The cottage is walking distance to the beach. Only downside is the bungalow is above the garage but I'm an early riser so it didn't bother me at all.
It was just a short walk to the beach, ecological preserve (hiking), and good restaurants. Virginia Beach proper is a 10 minute drive. We found it pretty packed with tourist (albeit it was the 4th of July weekend) and felt the Atlantic beach and Chesapeake Bay beach looked the same.
We loved this location and appreciated the quiet neighborhood with the conveniency of being minutes from the airport. Due to our travel arrangements we arrived late and left early and so we were grateful for our understanding hosts as well as the ease of access. The space was large and cozy with several excess comforts .
:) T was amazing! Quick responses and very helpful..we did a last minute switch on dates and she was very accommodating!
We stayed for 5 days, and had a very enjoyable stay. He gave us restaurant recommendations, which definitely made our stay better! You can hear his family walking in the apartment upstairs, but that is the nature of apartment living, and did not detract at all from the loveliness of the apartment.
His home is a real treat to discover with the unique architecture. Chuck is a consummate host, who sincerely cares about his guests. We felt very warmly welcomed.
You definitely don’t get that experience in a hotel! Tyler's place is amazing. Considering the fact that there aren't that many hotels outside of downtown SF, this Airbnb is better than having a hotel in the neighborhood of Bernal Heights.
Everything is as described on the webpage. I was only here 1 night but would definitely return if it was available again. Actually tried to come back on my return to SF but sadly it was already booked.
I just loved it!! She really made me feel welcome. They put so much thought into the decor and comfort for their guest .
Tiana is a very responsive and attentive host. Highly recommended spot for a couple looking for a beach getaway.
Would recommend! Elizabeth is a wonderful host! She is very sweet, helpful and good communicator.
Location can’t be beat, right smack dab in Chicago. Richard Batton restaurants and bars and little shops around. Quick few blocks walk to the parks- I walked from apt to Millennium Park in 18 mins, and even in January temperatures, it was a lovely walk.
The location is ideal. The studio is close to a brewery and to some of my favorites places to eat in the Bay:  Bake-sale Betty's and Burma Superstar. I would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend this place enough.
Francis Jones cabin exceeded my expectations. The bathrobe and slippers they provide are also a nice touch! The cabin is very homelike , and the coffee, tea, water, sugar, and cream provided were all very much appreciated.
The little touches like sticky tape, and scissors, even down to great clothes hangers that have material so your apparel stay on them! I will definitely be missing not only the great place but the beautiful people as well!
Elizabeth is warm and welcoming (and fluent in both English and Spanish). Fortunately, Elizabeth was willing to lose a good night's sleep to meet us, after our flight was canceled and our final flight arrived so late. She was so kind and helpful throughout our stay!
Hope to be back again in the summer months! This is an incredible space! Great location and very comfortable.
Cozy 2 bedroom upstairs cottage... with kitchen and living room. The beach is a few steps away. It has everything you may need inside the house, and it’s a great location.
They also allowed us to stay late on our last day due to our flight. Can’t say enough great things about them and their place! Definitely hope to come back again!
A lovely part of Berkeley, with beautiful gardens all around and the street is incredibly quiet so you can get a good night's rest. Highly recommended.
On our last morning there, we had delicious croissants and lattes at Masse's, a small slice of Paris on Shattuck. Walking distance from everything you needed and a short Lyft ride to the Fox Theater. Parking was no issue.
You can either walk to the famous spots or take the bus, which stops near the house. The house is really beautiful and the room was very clean and has a stylisch equipment. We liked it a lot.
You can walk to beach and there are restaurants and supermarket by ten minutes’ walk. And she is very kind. I highly recommend to stay her house!
Thank you Angela for your hospitality:) Not only was Angela’s place fantastic, she was a great hostess! She has thoughtfully placed the decor and all the amenities you could need.
We hope to come back soon! We were blown away by her hospitality and the beautiful interior design of the guest house in which we stayed. Every last touch one could think of was addressed.
Also Scott goes above and beyond to provide extra amenities that made us feel at home. All in all we had an amazing time and would absolutely come back!
My boyfriend and I had minimal interaction with the host, Aaron, but he’s easily accessible. We absolutely loved this place! Aaron was such a great host!
close by, which we loved. Target and many other stores are just 2 minutes away! Their place itself was cleanly kept, cozy, and just the right amount of space for the two of us.
Bennie Dudgeon's place is one in a million! If you're on the fence, I highly recommend you make the booking - you won't regret it. The house is even better than the picture show, and the rooftop deck is out of this world.
I’ve already booked my next visit in May. Thank you for hosting me again.
The room is very spacious, bed is incredibly comfy, bathroom is spotless, and there is parking on premises. This place was really cute and well-prepared. The room was adorable and had a really comfortable bed with fresh towels and linens.
In fact, one can virtually arrive with their clothing and will find all they need in full stock at the cottage. Cottage is larger than it appears in photos and has a lovely private patio with seating. Decor is modern farmhouse.
I phoned my family every other day. Thanks for having us in your lovely residence . Bennie Dudgeonand James Walker
This is literally the best place we have ever stayed in! There was everything you could possibly need, the place was immaculate and the beds were the most comfortable ones I’ve slept in! Even better than mine at home!
Very quick response by text so communication was perfect. Quiet nice residential area  Robert Huckabaa!!! Keureg machine with plenty of coffee cups to enjoy every morning  Close to Whole Foods,pharmacy and Hermosa Beach!
Chris is great at communication and gets back with you within the hour. I highly recommend this clean, spacious, quiet studio on the ground floor of a classic San Francisco house in the Inner Richmond District. What you get is  (1) a large space with a comfortable sofa and bed as well as a table with 2 chairs, (2) a small, separate kitchen with a microwave, sink, and small refrigerator well-stocked with mineral water, juices, yogurt, granola and other items, (3) a bathroom with a very large modern shower, and (4) a beautiful private garden with direct access from the studio through glass doors.
The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. Marianne's place was very nice and comfortable  A clean and modern place with all the amenities need it for our days in the area. The kitchen has everything you need to cook when needed it, it has a blender!
Supermarkets, nice cafes and restaurants are also nearby and you really don't need a car to explore everything. The whole package is 1+++. What can I say about heather... she is really a super host !!!!!!!
Jeremy Johnson was very thoughtful in the special touches she adds to her space like having beer and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived and making bikes available for us. It was a bonus to find out that she has this beautiful backyard space with an outdoor fireplace, comfy seating, cozy lights and lush gardens. Will absolutely stay here again.
Highly recommended !! We could use a pack and play for our baby and we could have even used bikes. I recommend this place for sure!
We felt like we were guests of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. Just make yourself at home and do as much or as little as you want. We met Mark and Jenny at the end of our stay and they are a delightful couple that we hope to see again soon.
Jerry and Julie were extremely accommodating and antic to work with. Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. I love sleeping under the stars and waking up to the ship on the water.
Everything we needed was provided and made for a very comfortable stay. He kindly offered for us to use his washer/dryer in unit, hold our bags after checkout until we headed out of the city, and of course gave us many recommendations and fun Chicago facts. Thank you, Pamela Drew!
In many ways, I hate to give a review like this because if people read it, they will know that this is THE PLACE to stay if you're coming to Hampton Roads. Joan Litwin met us as we pulled into their driveway and showed us to the Air B&B unit, which is a 2 bedroom apartment above a three car garage. Joan Litwin had EVERYTHING you would need, including milk in the fridge, cereal in the pantry, apple juice, a variety of Keurig flavors, and much more.
You can hear his family walking in the apartment upstairs, but that is the nature of apartment living, and did not detract at all from the loveliness of the apartment. We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in Chicago once more.
The neighborhood is so quiet and safe. It’s truly relaxing.
Loft was perfect option for visiting out Tacoma friend. There were two separate sleeping spaces at opposite end of huge loft. I slept on the sectional which was super comfy especially with the high end linens provided.
This topographic point is just as incredible in real life as it is in the pictures! I was afraid it was too good to be true, but I assure you, it really is that amazing! :) The topographic point is impeccably decorated and our hosts were so welcoming!
Clean bathroom/shower with water that stays hot. Oh, and a speaker system so you can plug in your phone and play music. We loved that they had sidewalk chalk since my fiance is an artist.
Richard Batton’s place is everything you want in a stay away from home. The private room is very large and comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the sea breeze from the balcony.
So many nice touches like Laurie's homemade granola,  Desperation Snacking Noodles (free ramen with beautiful bowls to eat out of),  great coffee and tea selections, desk with great view of backyard, nice selection of books (if you have time for reading), lots of bathroom essentials (loved having the makeup/face wipes and hand lotion) and everything was so clean and bright! Ben and Mike’s air bnb was prime location  - about a 15 min drive from the city with many restaurants and coffee (Philz included!) close by, which we loved.
I loved my getaway and plan to come back for more stays. If you are looking for a place in this area, THIS is the place to reserve! Outstanding hospitality, quick communication, a super stylish space, sparkling clean, full of local ideas for exploring and most impressive to me were the myriad of amazing amenities provided...you'll find an umbrella, thank you notes, paper, lots of soft blankets to curl up on the couch with, games, cards, puzzles, DVDs, books, a back scratcher, batteries, every imaginable toiletry in case you are lacking some, extra sheets and bed pillows, fans to keep cool if need be, a stocked kitchen with everything you need to cook and a bevy of items to make for breakfast, chocolates by the bedside, a bbq grill on a lovely patio and so much more.
Her place is minutes from the beach, it’s spotless- the ad doesn’t do the place justice. I’m new to the area and I offered for Elizabeth to come take a class at the gym I train at and she happily came. Her beautiful home is quiet.
The space was clean and bright due to the natural light that comes through the windows. With luxurious touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. We visited many of the places suggested on the card left for us in the room -- and loved them all!
Boardwalk and other cool spots aren’t much further either. Visiting CA from Texas and wanted to stay near the beach and LA. Location was perfect.
The local park/trails were explored daily and we even took the motorcycle out! Michael Krieg of restaurants nearby and so many good options! Tim has endless suggestions for you to fully enjoy your time here.
We'll definitely stay here again if their space is available during our next visit to Tacoma. Thanks again Brian and Debra Dibble for making our "stay-cation" so comfortable and memorable. D+N
Tons of activities and restaurants nearby, and just a few blocks away from the beach. From cruiser bikes to ride around town to beach blankets and towels, everything we needed was already there! Christine also provides some great suggestions of places to eat and things to do if you are at a loss during your stay.
The bed and was super comfy with quality quality sheets and a cozy duvet. We appreciated the amenities - hair dryer,  iron, mini fridge, snacks, coffee maker, etc. The fluffy towels and heated towel rack were a bonus!
We were met with incredible hospitality, a beautiful space, a super friendly porch, and a fantastic location. You could walk to a topographic point to eat or down to the beach. We were able to keep our vehicle rental off the street and park in a private space.
Janet Luckman didn’t miss a detail. Richard Batton place is located in a great quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance of grocery stores, restaurants, pharmacies and the University of Puget Sound which is a beautiful campus. Though a bit longer, the Tacoma waterfront is walkable for those who can handle hill .
Heather is a warm, thoughtful host who offers the visitor a clean and inviting apartment that stands out from the rest because it has a patio garden off the bedroom with beautiful flowers and trees. A little bistro table invites you to enjoy your morning coffee, while on the kitchen table a bottle of wine, some chocolate, and fresh cut flowers welcome your arrival. The apartment is comfortable, clean, and located right across the street from the ocean.
It has everything we needed for our two-day stay and is located conveniently near Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto. My husband and I enjoy walking and looking at the local architecture, and the street abutting the studio provided abundant opportunities for exploring the different building styles. Justin, himself, was very accommodating.
Edward Ramsey’s place is very homey and in a super convenient location when travelling to and from the airport because it is only a 20ish minute drive to the airport. The room is very nicely decorated and Edward Ramsey’s place is very clean. Although I didn’t actually get to meet her, I had a great time and had no problem getting into the house with her instructions.
Jo made every accommodation we had asked for and then some. She was responsive to initial inquiries about the space and replied within a short time to all communication. We are diffident of Tacoma.
When we walked back we were greeted by the delicious smell of different flowers growing overhead and around the yard. The cottage is older and there are a few things that show it’s age but they add character and did not effect our stay at all. It is sparkling clean and so charming.
Staying at Christian and Matthew An was absolute perfect. The house is lovely, clean and spacious and there is even a back yard where you can sit and have a nice breakfast in the morning. The hosts are friendly and helpful.
Nala's place is a nice, cozy space. There is a bar below that can play music until 5am and some patrons that hang outside to smoke for a little. If you are a super light sleeper, this is not the topographic point for you.
The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Pamela Drew movies. 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!
Although, we had our own supplies it was just convenient knowing that the supplies were there if we needed it. If I’m ever in Chicago, I would most definitely book and recommend others to book at your place.
Whole Foods is just a few short blocks down the hill. The array of chocolates in our room and in the kitchen and living room was a nice touch!
Just what was needed after a long day of travel. Just wish every AirBnB offered such hospitality.
Ceiling fan , air-conditioning n heater, t.v. washer/dryer. Walking distance to Kings Harbor, Whole Foods, and South Park nearby...... Over All a really nice place to stay, Thanks Neva and Logan (her puppy) Petite Boutique !
Plus complimentary beverages in the small fridge, a K-cup maker, snacks, device chargers, bathrobe, slippers, and many other thoughtful and elegant touches in the room and bath — you are in a private suite so to speak. There was zero noise from within the building or other occupants. The closet is large and generous to hold your suitcases, as this delightful room is more “pocket size” than the usual overly large hotel room; it’s more like an updated luxury room in an early 1900’s fancy city hotel (Algonquin in NYC, Benson in Portland, or a Westin packaged into a compact structure).
They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. Each June I travel from California to Tacoma to oversee a plan at the University of Puget Sound. My stay is for three weeks.
Join the nightlife in the Academy of Sciences on every Thursday evening. It's really an experience how they get science allied with urban life style to attract the people!! !
Neva also had thoughtful extras such as a basket of travel items in case guests forgot something - which I did so I appreciated the lotion. She has a air conditioning unit as well as space heater which was perfect. The bungalow is wonderfully located a few blocks from the beach and close to shops, restaurants, and groceries.
About a 15 minute walk to town, very doable, and also very accessible with buses and the BART station. Thank you, I would stay again!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Denise's loft is gorgeous and very spacious. Filled with art & comfy furniture.
I wish I could give more than five star . It was a delightful stay. Thanks so much again to Michelle and Arnold Jackson.
What a lovely experience staying at Heather's cottage. My brother and I were visiting Tacoma for a business trip. I don't have enough words to describe how wonderful Heather was.
Def will keep this one on our list to revisit! It was a last minute reservation and it worked out great. I needed a place to hold me over until I caught a flight out the next evening.
From the very start Bob and Sharann were warm and welcoming. It was more spacious than we thought and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom/shower is like new and the walk in closet provided plenty of space for storage and for the kitchen items.
I love that there is a desk now, since I do have to work a bit while away. Clean, spacious, convenient, quiet - couldn't ask for more. I highly recommend Liz's place!
We went hiking at First Landing State Park, went and saw the two old lighthouses close by (and also the site of the first landing), walked for miles along the beach, and ate at a few really good restaurants. Thanks to Jennifer Merry and Debra Dibble for making the trip even better!
Angelas place was one of the best Airbnb experience EVER! Her place was super clean and so beautiful, especially the back yard with the gorgeous orange tree and a fire pit to light up on a chilly night. I have never seen a more thoughtful host, she had everything available for a comfortable stay.
There was more than enough light and her cheerful plants and art made me feel right at home. Small touches like a welcome note, snacks, and a guide to the neighborhood were wonderful and I actually found two amazing eateries during my stay thanks to her helpful guidance. Water was always hot.
Elizabeth’s home is beautiful, not to mention, spotless clean! She was fast at responding my request and was very clear with check-in and out instructions. Very comfortable stay and definitely enjoyed being near the beach!
It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. The morning I was checking out, I had the chance to sit and chat with Michael on my way out while he prepared for his next guest. What a great, down to earth, knowledgable, compassionate adventure seeker Michael is...I loved the stories he had about the artistic and eccentric atmosphere that his  loft had to offer!
Maggie's townhome consists of renovated "apartments"- ours had two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a little kitchenette and dining area. The place was very clean and comfortable...we couldn't recommend it more! Thank you, Maggie!
The drive to Manhattan was fine during weekend. Parking on the street was tough, but there is a parking garage for $25 per night just 5 min walk from the home. Overall, we have nothing but positive memories.
Loved our stay here. Lovely area and very handy to shops, restaurant and the subway link. You don't need to go far for the best value shopping around.
Gloria is also a very friendly and helpful host who communicates and responds quickly. Absolutely loved our stay and recommend it to anyone for a nice, intimate getaway in Tacoma :)
A true godsend when you are many miles from home! Bennie Dudgeon made us feel like we were at our home away from home!! We will definitely be staying here again!
We did not drive to Elizabeth's house but she offered parking in her driveway. Elizabeth provided separate entry codes for the front door and the room. The room itself was better than expected.
The bed is very comfy and we really appreciated the charging stations on either side. If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a bit tricky on the streets, especially late at night. During the day we didn't have much trouble finding a place to park.
About a 10 min walk from the BART and a short stroll to lots of neighborhood spots. Very clean apartment; convenient location. It's quite small, essentially a bedroom and the front hallway and bathroom.
I usually right long reappraisal but I really have to simply say that Maggie's place is AWESOME. FABULOUS. It is one of the truly cleanest airbnb's I've stayed in.
It was perfect for a winter visit to Chicago with the amazing fireplace and heated floors. There was always parking available on the street right outside the house. Which was a major plus for us.
It is a beautiful city with dramatic views. We look forward to visiting again in the future.
Lots of beach toys available on site to use. Thank u Tiana for ur kindness and thoughtfulness- I will return! Marsha Finn
Can walk around late at night without problem. Their dog Meatball is very friendly and will keep you company if you want it. Overall one of the best Airbnb experience I have to date and will book again when I come back to Chicago.
Some reviews have mentioned footsteps upstairs. We would definitely stay here again.
This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud. Host provides ear plugs which is a nice touch for those of us who are not deep sleeper ! My family loved it.
If you're on the fence, I highly recommend you make the booking - you won't regret it. It's location is the perfect launching pad for both daytime exploring and evening shenanigans - all while nestled under some very tall and expensive looking buildings. It's like staying at the house in the movie 'Up' - such a blast!
There was a small issue when we checked in, but it was resolved so quickly and communication was great. We had an amazing time and would definitely stay there again!
We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedroom listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds. floss? not to worry!
I liken it to house-sitting for your girlfriend, who has magazine-worthy taste in antique collecting and design! Jeanna was a splendid host, and did everything to make our stay so easy and comfortable. We appreciated the added kindness of coffee and snacks along with all the kitchen equipment we could want.
After a long day at the beach, we were able to wash away our day in the oversized  shower (loved the shower so much!) Don't overlook this cozy little apartment by the ocean--this place is a gem! Heather really made us feel welcome in her beautiful in-law apartment with a lush garden out back to sit and enjoy coffee in!
She let us drop off our bags a few hours early before her already already check-in which was great! Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city. Lyft rides were all about $5-$15 which was great!
It is convenient to shops and restaurants. It is also very convenient to the complimentary Link rail system so you can get all the manner to the Tacoma Dome or other attractions like the Museum of Glass in a few minutes. The accommodations are comfortable, clean, and soothing.
The location is excellent, right near the beach and easily walkable/bikeable/Uber-able. Would definitely stay here again!
The bedrooms have plenty of room, the bathrooms are spacious and the living room is cozy with a warm fireplace. Lastly the rental homes that stand out the most to us are the ones where we can tell the hosts genuinely care about every detail and making sure at every step that guests are cared for. Jerry & Julie made our late (midnight) check in a breeze and were always available if we ever needed anything.
The room was clean, linens were fresh, and there more than enough towels and washcloths made available. Elizabeth also offered beach towels and chair for our use. Checkout was also easy and seamless.
A true godsend when you are many miles from home! Let me start by saying this home is absolutely amazing, but what makes this place special is the first class cordial reception from Chuck the owner and Bob the maintenance man! We had our wedding here, and it was more than we could have imagined!
This studio is small but packs a lot of punches! Every corner has something tucked away to make maximum use of the space. Very stylish set up.
Her place was sparkling clean, comfortable and the décor was spot on. We enjoyed our morning conversations over coffee with Gregory Simons in the common area. What a great place to stay if you get a chance to book it.
You can see the ocean from your bedroom window. Bikes saved us from having to rent them, and we enjoyed riding many miles along the beach. Scott is a great host- I give him my highest recommendation!
Danielle’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s business district as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line.
Sheri Vowell’s topographic point was so perfect for two couples. The space was decorated really nice, everything was very comfortable including the beds & lounge area plus there was thoughtful amenities like a mini fridge, coffee maker & washer/dryer for guests to use. Sheri Vowell were so friendly and welcoming, they made us feel at home right away and are truly amazing host !
A beautiful place very clean and everything you need. Great place  and very clean. Cozy and close to everthing.
Neva was an excellent host -- very accommodating and responded quickly to any questions. We had a fantastic time!
We were in the city to see Marcos Blount, but also went to the Art Institute Chicago and ate dinner at the Blue Door. They also had great suggestions for places to eat in their neighborhood. We went to Sweet Maple and Stax for breakfast and Rosebud for dinner one night.
I would definitely stay here again. This artists loft is a very special place! Loads of natural light fills the room during the day and enchanting fairy lights are strung for your enjoyment at night.
I had a wonderful time at Christina's place. The description of the list is very accurate, it really did feel like a retreat. I stayed 3 nights and would have loved to stay longer.
The space was cute, clean, and had good amenities. The place was amazing! It had everything you would need for even a longer stay in LA.
We loved that they had breakfast items in the fridge for us - so sweet! You can definitely hear the kids running around upstairs, but that didn’t really bother us because they mentioned that they had kids and pet in the original post so we knew what we were getting ourselves into. We were early risers anyway.
Lots of really great thoughtful touches in the room that made it feel homey that I don't usually see in many other topographic point . Would definitely stay there again!
This was our first bnb experience and I only hope all are as nice! First off she is very easy to communicate with from the initial request to the day you leave. Since we had never been to a bnb we had many questions and she was very knowledgeable.
Marcos Blount's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit bizarre , quiet, & "comfy". I think my best endorsement that I can say about it is that I would happily live here! Marcos Blount is a lovely person, and her puppy is brilliant!
I've found my second home! The neighborhood is delightful and convenient and the space itself is fabulous -- beautifully appointed, everything one needs and enjoys. There is a comfortable work space for guests traveling on business.
The kitchen is fully stocked, good for cooking your own meals. Clean bathroom/shower with water that stays hot. Lots of book that I wish I had time to read!
it's there!)! Thanks Michael! !
This was the concluding Airbnb location to our 10 days vacay in Washington and Vancouver. Honestly, this couldn’t have been anymore perfect to top of our last weekend before heading back home. We knew what type of place we were heading into from the photos, but when we actually arrived  we were so surprised on how beautiful this place was in person.
Check in was easy. I didn't stay at Igor's but have organised for my parents and my little sister to stay at Igor's. It is their first time in the US and is the first time using AirBnB.
It's a comfortable space in a very convenient location (quick walk to BART station) on a quiet street, and had everything we needed, and more, to make us feel right at home. The kitchen is well-equipped, and the thoughtful touches of eggs, English muffins, milk, coffee, etc., etc. meant that we were all set for breakfasts.
The Neighborhood felt very safe and quiet. The flower vines were in bloom, the view walking up onto the deck and the details of decor even on the outside let us know this place was special! There was adequate space to have a wonderful stay in a fun house with every amenity!
Chip's place was absolutely perfect for a relaxing couple of days. It felt very secluded and quiet, but was just ~15 minutes driving from downtown Vashon. The cabin itself was cozy, spotless and extremely comfortable.
Our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to  Chuck's experienced guidance. He's a wealth of help at just the right moment! His home is airy and warm, an uncommon juxtaposition.
I can’t wait to go back believe me when I say this guy went above and beyond and it was second to none! This place was perfect for our family of four. The sand is steps from the bottom of the stairs, and the beach is perhaps 30 stairs from there, just over the dune.
The love of my life and  sweetheart Was so happy to stay there. I haven’t been on a bike in so many years. It was a vocational experience that her and I truly treasured.
It’s cozy!! Near the beach. I feel at home for sure.
The lone thing that I would have enjoyed and  made it perfect would have been a bathtub! Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! She was a fantastic host to top it off!
Neva's topographic point was my favorite air bnb, ever. If you are lucky enough to find this place open for the dates you're considering, snap it up! It's a gem, and she is a lovely, kind hostess.
They also have the coolest book where you can take a photo of yourself and write about your travels - so it was really neat to look through it and see all of the people who had stayed with them before us. We will definitely be staying with Ralph and Laura again when we are in the area. We definitely recommend!
There is a private outside sitting area where we could let the dogs walk around safely on their own while we enjoyed the Dennis Steward An weather, a definite plus for any dog owner. Tiana was a wonderful host who responded promptly to our questions while being friendly and welcoming. I definitely recommend this cottage to anyone looking for a great stay in the area!
Angela is such an outstanding host, paying attention to details and going above and beyond. For example, there was a freak power outage in the area when I arrived. Angela had put out lots of candles to light the place up, making it even cozier.
My Dad enjoyed the tasty and healthy breakfasts. At the end of the week, we hugged our hostess and thanked her for my Dad's fantastic stay!
We both felt super comfortable and Arthur Paddick responded immediately to our questions when we checked in. Not sure what renting bikes elsewhere would have costed but the ease of use with these and being able to ride them everywhere back and forth made the trip that much better. I recommend Arthur Paddick’s place for anyone visiting Virginia beach!
My friend and I took a lyft to the place and it was easy to find. We were able to check in and out quickly. The place was very clean and spacious with many amenities available to us including a fridge stocked with water and other things like a hair dryer, slippers, and hygiene products which was very thoughtful.
We had a wonderful and very comfortable stay at Paul's place. The property is gorgeous and clean and very close to the beach. It was a little chilly in Redondo the weekend that we were there so we didn't get a chance to take advantage of the bicycles/beach items that Paul provided but we appreciated having the option.
~20 Uber ride to downtown. I would definitely give this spot another visit and recommend it to others.
We stayed at Wiseacre for an extended holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. Chuck is an excellent host - communication was always prompt and clear and we felt very welcome to share his home immediately. We have highly recommended and shared this opportunity with friends and family.
This space is beautiful and private. The bed is very comfortable. There is a coffee maker and cable TV.
Deborah Hines's home is an amazing topographic point to stay. This place is deserving the money! Deborah Hines was also very considerate and kept in good communication with us during our stay.
She has thought of everything. Brian Burns has a bent for hosting and staying at her place was a 5 star treat!
Super cozy and comfortable bed, the space heater quickly took care of the chilly nights, lots of little touches like tea and snacks. Louise is also very accommodating. I needed a iron and hair dryer and they were provided for me.
Maggie's townhome consists of renovated "apartments"- ours had two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a little kitchenette and dining area. The place was very nicely decorated and we had everything we needed, plenty of linens, towels, bite and drinks! Our flight arrived at 9am so Maggie very graciously allowed us to drop our bags off in the morning before we headed in to the city.
His place was the perfect spot for me and my husband. Heater in the closest which we used because we didn’t know it’d be that cold in June! Smart TV that you can log in to your Netflix/Hulu/etc accounts.
Minutes from the beach with all the amenities that you could possibly need. Cant say enough good things about our stay!
Tons of restaurants nearby and so many good options! The kitchen is fully stocked, good for cooking your own meals. Huge closet space so you’re not living out of your suitcase.
All in all great stay and would definitely come back to Tammy in the future! Bikes, beach chairs and towels are also available. Tammy was wonderful and met me on arrival and helped me with parking and my things.
Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay.
Paul's guesthouse is clean, quiet, safe, and in a great location. Paul greeted us immediately upon arrival and was extremely hospitable. The bed is comfortable, bathroom is great including the shower!
The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the opportunity to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!
It did not disappoint. I loved my getaway and plan to come back for more stays. Proctor Cottage is one of my very favorites and I highly recommend it!
My wife and I just got married and spent a few days in Chicago and we were glad to stay here for our mini-moon. My only hesitation would be that it's pretty far from downtown around 30 minutes away and the bus in front took long but Uber was very easy and not as expensive as we thought it would be. We're planning to go to Chicago again and we will definitely hit up this place again when we do!
Maggie and John Brashier are wonderful and thoughtful hosts anyone could ask for! Loved the welcome basket on the table and small candies they put on our beds as well. The amenities are beyond expectation and there's even washing machine and dryer that you can use for free.
We had a great time with 4 adults and our small dog. Great beachy guest house! Very close to Redondo Beach and we loved biking around, it was a nice touch!
I would highly recommend his place. We had a great time in San Francisco celebrating our 35th Wedding Anniversary. It is a beautiful city with spectacular views.
Elizabeth is an incredibly warm, friendly, genuinely beautiful human. And her house also happens to be comfortable and well positioned in Long Beach. If you're looking for a comfortable stay with an interesting and friendly host, look no further.
Room was just as pictured, bathroom was spacious and clean. Only issue was that my bf complained about hearing a loud television noise that couldn’t let him sleep. But, I slept great no issues didn’t bother me.
Very cool vibration and her dog Bailey is adorable. We would definitely stay again.
This was our second stay at Susan’s place. This apartment is the cleanest, most quiet place that we have rented. Susan is a helpful and responsive host.
This is an absolute gem that we lucked into during our stay in Tacoma! Bennie Dudgeon is an amazing host - quick response times, wonderful insights about the area, and just a warm ,funny, and friendly person. We loved getting to chat with her.
It has everything you may need inside the house, and it’s a great location. (about 8 min drive to airport, and very close to many restaurant ) We loved our time in Brent’s cottage. One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located.
Jeff & Mike are excellent hosts. Our door had it’s own lock which was a big plus considering you are sharing the home with other guests staying in the other bedrooms. The biggest plus was the central location of the home.
The suite is convenient and comfortable, yet private and peaceful. The queen size wooden sleigh bed is comfortable, and the entire suite is both roomy yet cozy. Check-in with Bob and Sharann was outstanding.
Neighborhood was quiet. Shelton Gill a fantastic host and it shows. His place is super clean, modern, and quiet.
This. topographic point !!! Lauren Jensen and Marc were really responsive, but also respect your privacy.
I could go on and on. I wish I could give more than five stars. We would return to Tacoma just to stay at Proctor Cottage!
If you see an opening do not hesitate. A room with a view. This is my second stay and it is as perfect as the first.
P.S. Melissa's place is not fancy, but it was within cycling distance of the beach and restaurants, and she was friendly and helpful with dining suggestions. I was only there for a short one night stay, but I brought my bicycle and had a great ride through a nearby park that came out close to Rudees Inlet, where I picked up the boardwalk and rode to the north end of the beach for a swim and a great meal at a local restaurant.
The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. We also ubered to pier 39 and it was about $10. Highly recommend Tyler’s place!
Overall, it was an unforgettable experience and we had a wonderful time! We will definitely book this place again if we visit Chicago!
The place is perfectly located close to the beaches but also close to restaurant and supermarkets. We really enjoyed the bikes that are provided complimentary. Can only recommend staying with her.
He really has thought of everything and has equipped the room and en-suite with all the necessities for guest . The apartment is well located and is in walking distance to the trendy Mission District. Tyler has a lot of useful tips to share for tasty restaurants and parallel bars .
Would gladly stay again! If I’ll have the chance to go again to Virginia Beach, I’ll chose Katherine’s place! Best,  Adelina
Their home is attractive and tranquil, with a lovely garden in back. I appreciated the Keurig coffee machine and fan in the bedroom, as well as the breakfast provided. We had a delightful chat, and I felt like I was staying with new friends.
This place was really cute and well-prepared. It is exactly as she describe the place. Easy check-in and out.
We especially liked tuning into the jazz station from the analog radio. This place is a gem. A cozy, über homey private spot w a great location.
We realized right away that Bob and Sharann could easily charge twice the amount they are asking for each night, just because of the value of the place alone. Bob and Sharann were perfect hosts. I stayed with them for three weeks during my relocation to JBLM.
The room is huge, with a very large comfortable bed and great amenities. We'd stay again in a flash and would thoroughly recommend it if you are visiting Redondo beach which is only a short walk away, as are plenty of places for eating and shopping. Elizabeth is a delightful lady and a perfect host.
Great little place close to the beach and a comes with a parking spot. Was a perfect start to our roadtrip. It's clean, quiet and comfortable, plus it's got a couple of bicycles which we used for a day trip to Santa Monica.
They provide everything you need; you don't have to worry about bringing shampoo or Q-tips. Ernie and Lenora are definitely super hosts; we had a wonderful stay in their home for four nights, and they were so generous and accommodating when we were unable to arrive on our expected date.
Although I wasn't certain from the home description, there are actually two small spaces to sit outside and enjoy the weather--on the front porch and on a bench in the front yard. The home itself has lots of charm and is nicely decorated throughout. The large open living/dining area is a great place to relax.
Angela was super apologetic about the light construction happening next door, but there's nothing she could have done about that. Angela was extremely friendly and welcoming. The place was so cozy, clean, and perfect for two people.
Also- I cannot overstate how fantastic it was to have a parking topographic point ! The online pics don’t quite do it justice. Shelton Gill was easy to communicate with and answered all of my inquiries right away.
We are repeat visitors to Tacoma and will definitely try to book the Proctor Cottage again. I've found my second home! I teach at the University of Washington Tacoma campus and live on the Olympic Peninsula.
The location was perfect and the hosts were amazing. The cottage felt very private and yet we were close to a variety of things to do! We were only a 5 minute walk away from the beach and just a hop away from a variety of great places to eat and drink.
Words can not express how nice Tammy and Brian Burns were. They treat you like you are literally family. We already decided to come back later in the year because of the location and how awesome Tammy and Brian Burns made our experience.
Thankful that we had a wonderful & pleasant stay at Pamela Drew place. Pamela Drew place was the best place we could imagine staying during our vacation to San Francisco! Her place was immaculately clean and the bed was super comfortable.
Gloria was an awesome host. She allowed us to keep our luggage in the space until we headed to the airport and indicated that if she ended up needing the place earlier, she’d store it at her home for us. I absolutely recommend Gloria’s place!
The vicinity is beautiful. !
You can book this place with your eyes closed. And with the money saved just Uber your way around ! Go home to a gorgeous and quiet garden, get into the hot tub after a long day of sightseeing !
"Above and beyond" expectations is clearly their motto. They are the perfect hosts. I’ve already booked my next visit in May.
I can’t recommend this topographical point enough. We will definitely be back. Thanks for everything, Angela!
Happy stay to you! Lina Kennedy  Lina Kennedy M ( telephone number hidden by Airbnb) / B (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) E. ( electronic mail hidden by Airbnb)   (Hidden by Airbnb) : lina.kennedy (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) _Thomas George
We felt incredibly safe and welcomed in Min’s home. He is fast to respond and assist with any questions you might have. I can not recommend this topographic point enough!!
I have never seen a more thoughtful host, she had everything available for a comfortable stay. She even light candles and turned in twinkling lights for us in the back yard in the every evening. She has put so much care into every single detail and created a wonderful experience.
On top of that, the location is awesome - two blocks from the beautiful beach and the bike path and close to lots of restaurants. Paul is a very friendly and welcoming host who went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we need. We would definitely stay here again if we are back in LA!
This is a gorgeous space, decorated with creative flair. It’s very close to the BART station, so it’s very accessible, but it feels like an oasis of calm. Everything you could need is provided and all the cupboards are clearly labelled.
Star and Austin's home was clean and comfortable - I felt at home as soon as we walked in the door! We rode the bikes to the beach each day (about a 4 minute ride away). There are quite few restaurants within biking/ walking distance as well that were recommended by Star and Austin.
Zeena and her husband, Francis Jones, have a beautiful home and were very gracious hosts. When we rolled up to the front door, Zeena was very welcoming, happy, and energetic in her greeting. She took the time to give us a little tour of the house even though we were only staying one night.
Electronics kits? What nostalgia on the games! A * authoritative * leather-bound fiddling pursuit  even!
Joan Litwin and Matthew An's place was one of the nicest so far. The place was apparatus beautifully to accommodate my husband, myself and our grown son for a few days. We enjoyed wine on the patio in the late afternoons and cooked breakfast in the morning.
The loft was very cozy and comfortable . It was very adorable. We arrived late driving down from Poulsbo after spending time with family on Easter.
~Lynne and Lori Stewart is an amazing host! Her place is absolutely adorable and very comfortable.
An absolute gem of a place! Richard Batton and his dog Charlotte are so welcoming!! My child and I came for my son’s/their brother’s wedding.
A severe snow storm came through Tacoma while we were staying and she made sure we had breakfast and gave advice when it was best to continue on our journey. Marcia provided great American hospitality. Sue and Herb
A short walk to the marina, beaches and close to Whole Foods and tons of food options. Great host - Angela is fantastic.
Immaculately clean. The screen in porch is nothing short of charming . The nature in the backyard is, too.
Stephanie is a lovely host. I stayed at Stephanie's place for about 3 calendar calendar month , so if anyone was going to find something bad about this place, it would have been me. But I never did!
My dog Benson and I had a great stay at Mona's place! The space itself was perfect - super comfy bed, huge TV, brand new bathroom with an amazing shower! All very clean and well kept.
I was flabbergasted at the size and  how extremely beautifull her decore was. The stay was epicurean , and the price was unbelievably cost effective. Do not miss the opportunity to stay with her if she has the vacancy.
No one was cramped. Played a lot of different games as well that we set up and borrowed from Teresa Knight. It is amazing everything you might have forgotten to bring he has and shares with you.
When we wanted to stay an additional day, he couldn’t accommodate us because the guesthouse was already rented out for the next day but he made a few calls and found us another Airbnb to stay in! Thanks again Paul!
Separate, private entrance with private seating area and space for motorcycle , boogie boards and more. Very clean and comfortable updated bathroom and bedroom. Comfy bed.
I stayed at Elizabeth’s place after getting in from a long flight, before driving home the next day. Great location and close to the beach. The room had everything and the bed was very comfortable.
We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. Uncharted books was a favourite of ours. In our opinion it was nice to stay out of downtown yet still close to anything you may need.
Everything about our time at Angela’s beautiful bungalow was wonderful. Thank you Angela & Bailey ❤️
Jeanna is great as well. Had a great conversation with her and her husband as well, they are very friendly.
Just stayed here a second time. A quick 20 minutes from LAX and you are a world away in the lovely 'surf city' Hermosa Beach. The house itself is  about 2 blocks off the beach.
Will be back. Recommend absolutely!
It was within walking distance of a bunch of restaurants, as well. Miranda Malone and Bennie Dudgeon were great hosts and had lots of great recommendations! They also had some beach gear available, if we wanted to borrow anything.
The day of the trip, I realized that the cabin was only supposed to welcome 2 people so I told Chip, and he was very nice at accommodating this last minute change. Chip came to welcome us when we arrived. An awesome experience.
Tyler has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience. Tyler has thought of everything in this great apartment. From eco friendly toiletries, to bedside chargers and snacks, the space is cleverly designed and filled with personal touches to make you feel at home.
I recently stayed at the Private Cozy Cottage a 2nd time, from Jan 30th to Feb 6th. And this is a huge plus, the cottage is perfect situated in a quiet residential neighborhood as opposed to being on a busy street. And another plus, Heather's house is directly behind the cottage.
The cottage is surrounded by beautiful trees and plants and there are many parks to explore in the area too. They had all the amenities needed and provided nice additional items like chocolate, tea, and an extensive selections of books as well. I met Chris & Tim multiple times during my stay; they were nice to talk to and they gave me multiple pointers on things to in the area that suited my interest.
I pulled up to the cabin and saw a charming well-taken care of abode, with a grill out front and little hearts carved into the wood panels for the railing. Do not shape your expectations that you are staying in a hotel, instead view this as your little family cabin or a family members. The place is clean and homey, with little amenities tucked everywhere but in a comfortable 'lived-in' style.
Of particular note was a most excellent shower - an area that can be shoehorned in at some other places, especially when the rental has been crafted out of a basement or attic. Linda and her house are very warm and welcoming. A great place to decompress and relax.
The home is decorated so meticulously and thoughtfully. Everything was delicious. Zeena has a servants heart and radiated love from the minute we met her.
Thanks for a great place to stay! My girlfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful stay at Paul's guest house. It was immaculate and Paul was very responsive, with detailed and easy to follow instructions, directions, and tips.
Many thanks for all !!! We hope to come again very soon :-)
Rayford Kelly was incredibly fast to respond and made sure we had everything we needed and then some. She responded whenever we needed anything and was so helpful. We couldn’t have enjoyed our stay more and HIGHLY recommend.
This was the clean Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Lauren Jensen takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated.
The bed and was super comfy with quality quality sheet and a cozy duvet. We appreciated the amenities - hair dryer,  iron, mini fridge, snacks, coffee maker, etc. The fluffy towels and heated towel rack were a bonus!
Thomas George is very knowledgeable about  local activity and has great suggestions if you want to do some site seeing. The room is well appointed and spacious, with lots of spare clean towels. When I stay with Thomas George, I am in the lap of luxury!
Everything about our time at Roberta Hallenbeck beautiful bungalow was fantastic . Clifford Winkler is so warm & has created a gorgeous private haven in Redondo Beach, which is a great location. Her lovely dog, Bailey, made it extra special.
This space has everything you could think of that you might require for a few days away. There was good communication with Jeni when we were delayed five hours, The cottage was warm clean and welcoming. Having robes in the closet and breakfast supplies for the morning was invaluable after arriving 5 hours later than planned.
Leslie’s home is SO adorable, cute, happy—everything we hoped for and more. All of my guests couldn’t stop raving about the house. Even hours later after settling in, I found myself looking around the home and smiling at how home-y, clean and stylish everything was.
I loved this simple and serene space. The location is great. Quiet and peaceful but a quick walk to Standard Fare (my new favorite) or to Highwire coffee to do some work remotely.
This was the final Airbnb location to our 10 days vacay in Washington and Vancouver. Honestly, this couldn’t have been anymore perfect to top of our last weekend before heading back home. We knew what type of place we were heading into from the photos, but when we actually arrived  we were so surprised on how beautiful this place was in person.
Very clean! Will definitely be staying here again in the future as we come to Oakland to visit friend often.
And then she goes beyond all that and stocks the fridge with delicious foods, thoughtfully selected, so you can enjoy your breakfast or a snack and get a "taste" of the local fare. Susan’s place was an absolute gem. I travel a lot for work and have stayed in many Airbnb’s, and Susan has been, by far, the most attentive and generous host ever!
You can’t go wrong with Tyler’s downstairs apartment! It is the best Air bnb we have had in SF. The amenities are more than you could need or want, and the place is stylish, very functional, and super clean.
Great place and super nice host (loved the dog). The patio was peaceful to unwind and giant closet space was helpful to keep stuff out of the way. Location excellent to Hermosa and Redondo and nice not to have to search for parking!
Looking forward to next time! The place is excellent. We didn't have any problems to get to it.
There is an keyless entry to the apartment. There is a beautiful terrace, private and confortable. We had all we needed for our weekend.
This studio is in a great location in Bernal Heights, very walkable to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, public theodolite , and parks. The studio is fairly small but the space is utilized quite efficiently so you have just about everything you could need. My wife and I stayed for three nights with our four month old daughter and had a great time.
It was tucked away in a residential vicinity , but easy to transition back to the interstate. The kitchen and living room more charming, and the bed were very comfortable. We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast in the cozy kitchen, and would’ve been happy to stay for more days if our travel plans had allowed.
Can’t wait to return! !
I usually rent an entire place on Airbnb, so this was only the 2nd time I rented a room. It seems like it could feel awkward, but Barb and Pat were extremely welcoming. Their home is lovely, and the room is clean, light, with plenty of room for 1 or 2 people.
If you want a quiet beach vacation or long weekend, this is an excellent choice. You really have run of the house and Thomas George really thinks of everything. There is an abundance of everything you could need for your stay.
Angela's place was amazing, perfect location near the pier, restaurants and shopping. She provided thoughtful excess touches; wine, coffee, snacks, even brought us donuts one morning. Yum!
Just perfect. The space was beautiful with a real relaxing atmosphere. It was a reasonable 20 minute walk to mission district where we were spoilt for choice in food and bar options.
When we were there, the temp outside was like 31 degrees. Maggie was also super fast in responding to inquiries through the Airbnb chat. Answered questions during our stay within minutes.
Speakingof bikes, they are a great amenity. With dedicated bike lanes, it is easy and fun. Christine's dining recommendations were spot on.
This place was perfect and priced extremely well! Came in town to pick up my wife a diamond ring and ejoynthe beach while we were in town! Paul and his wife were great hosts!!
Fantastic stay! Highly recommended. I loved my time at Neva's beach bungalow.
The stay here was amazing! it exceeded our expectations, there's nothing bad to say about this place. Chuck was really good at answering our questions and giving us advice of places near by.
After a 3 week road trip staying in lots of places, Heathers apartment was the by far the best and I hope to return someday. Thank you ❤️
The description of the listing is very accurate, it really did feel like a retreat. The space was so cute, she is very thoughtful and creative with the decorations and lots of attention to detail to make the space as comfortable as possible for guests. She actually uses the room as a guest room for friends and family normally so this isn't some Airbnb where they slap together all their old and mismatched furniture and sheets.
The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. The place was sparkling clean, the amenities were more than sufficient and the private parking space was an added bonus in a town where free parking is not easily available. A stone throws distance from Whole Foods to pick up some food and the neighborhood is lovely and we felt very safe.
The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemons! And the hot bathtub ... what a dainty . You will love staying here!
Elizabeth was the nice hostess! If I ever need a place in the area again, I will definitely be staying at this topographic point !
The place is also incredibly convenient, a block away from the free train into downtown Tacoma. Brian and Hillary were also very accommodating and on top of their communication (I quickly received a response to all my questions). Check-in is a breeze and the star lights were a fantastic welcome.
Small snacks (chips, granola bars) were unexpected and very welcome - we were running late for an event when we arrived and weren't certain we'd be able to eat dinner that night. Highly recommend, you'll be happy here.
You can book this place with your eyes closed. Even though it’s quite far from downtown it’s definitely worth it. It’s definitely cheap ( and better) than what you can find downtown.
Her home is immaculately clean, the room is spotless, and the linens and towels are sanitized before each guest. You are greeted and welcomed by Zeena into her home as if you are family and she takes care of your needs as such, maybe even better. Dorothy Moser was wonderful and there are several options.
There was a dedicated parking space too! Highly recommended!
Definitely cannot wait to return and stay here again! We had a great stay! Liz’s home is beautiful, spotless, and comfortable, and it’s located just a few block from beach.
The room is in a beautiful San Francisco Victorian in the back of the house. It has many of the hallmarks of this architecture, like the high ceilings and the ornate crown molding, and because it was located in the back of the house it was surprisingly quiet. We slept really well!
The location is about a half hour from the beach and located in a quaint neighborhood. I wish we came during a warmer season so we could use the pool and hot tub. The guest house was neat and homey, decorated very cunning .
She was easy to communicate with and always available with a quick response. Her place is beautifully decorated, clean and very comfortable. We enjoyed the private outdoor patio area right outside the bedroom.
The complimentary snacks were also a very nice touch. This place is truly charming. If we're ever in Chicago we hope we can stay here again.
We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. Angelas place was one of the best Airbnb experiences EVER! She was such a wonderful host and greeted us when we arrived ( added bonus: with her adorable puppy Bailey).
Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed amenities. Overall, would highly recommend! !
The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave.
We will definitely return! The Ship Watch was amazing! The view was to die for!!
Very clean and nicely decorated. It was a bit of a tight space for 4 adults but definitely doable! Overall very lovely!
The place is very close to grocery store, some resto and the Belmont Blue station. I love love love Danielle's place. It's extremely charming and well decorated.
Thanks again! Melissa is a super host, and definitely one of the most kind and thoughtful people I've met through Airbnb. Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach.
I wish we could have stayed longer! We would love to stay here again on our following visit to Tacoma!
Leslie is an outstanding host and went above and beyond setting up her home for an amazing stay. Second, every detail had been thought out and arranged to make our stay as breezy as possible. We only stayed a couple days, but the house is set up for even a 2 week-long relaxing stay.
The space is furnished and decorated beautifully. We were there to enjoy the beach as much as we could, and Paul made sure we had everything we desired for our beach excursions. He even brought us ice packs and tray so we can pack up the cooler.
Tiana was very accommodating and was there to assist and help us with our needs and concerns. Her wonderful beach cottage was beyond immaculate. It was a pleasure.
It has such fun style and great layout for solo or couples traveling. My girlfriend and I had just come off a week long bike ride/camping/party trip with the company work for through Napa Valley. We were in need of some quite time and restful .
Thank you, Arthur Paddick and Charlotte, for providing your amazing home as a wedding venue. My family stayed at Arthur Paddick's spacious and funky home, Wiseacre, during my daughter's graduation weekend from Old Dominion University. This mid-century modern gem and its gorgeous property provided the perfect setting for a post-graduation dinner which we hosted for family and friends.
There are even hummingbird feeders right outside the window which make for the most cheerful view. We were only able to stay for a night but we would absolutely love to come back! Thank you for providing such a peaceful, restful space for a little pre-baby getaway!
This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud. Host provides ear plugs which is a nice touch for those of us who are not deep sleepers! My family loved it.
Feels like a cozy home away from home We really loved staying at Justin's place - perfect for our needs. Incredibly-well located near to the University campus, gourmet ghetto with its great choice of eateries, and the Rose Garden and hills above.
We weren’t prepared for a 12 autopsy check out as we planned for 1pm per what was on Airbnb. Linda/Mike thought we knew it was a 12pm check out and when we told our hosts we thought 1pm, they did not rush us at all, even though they had to prep for their following reservations at 2pm. We did our best to rush check out as it was a miscommunication that was not on Linda/Mike.
I am a runner and ran a couple of mornings north on Yakima for a 5 mile run. We will definitely book again the next time we are in the area.
For anyone you who planning on going to Chicago! Book this place! Trust me, it’s a lifesaver!
Comes with an Alexa set up, which was great because we played music in the mornings and to check that day's weather before we went out. In that same vein, the neighborhood the home is located in is very quiet and lovely, so we truly never worried about our safety once we arrived. The washer/dryer hook up is handy for cleaning your clothes.
The interior decoration is beautiful! We will stay with them whenever we visit Du Pont.
Elizabeth is a kind, friendly host. This bedroom and private bath in Elizabeth's home was much larger than I realized, with a great little attached balcony. Elizabeth provided bottled water and lots of bathroom amenities, and she went out of her her way my first night in town to give me a ride to a nearby restaurant as she was running her errands.
Miranda Malone’s place was conveniently located for a week of traveling around the LA area. The guest house was a perfect size for two people to stay comfortably and her backyard area was great for hanging out and having a glass of wine or playing with her adorable puppy, Logan. Miranda Malone was an awesome host, always available and eager to make certain we had everything we needed for a great stay.
It has a classic antique sort of feeling and everything is so well maintained you could feel that this little space has been well cared for. We especially liked tuning into the jazz station from the analog radio. On a quiet street just a couple blocks from shops/restaurants and about a 30 minute stroll along the lake to BART.
There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy.
Scott’s topographic point was perfect for my LA beach weekend getaway! He was out of town during my visit but none the less was a very attentive host who made sure to message me to ask me my arrival time, check in on me and leave me tips about using the houses many amenities. That brings me to my 2nd point - the amenities at Scott’s were fantastic!
Even though we arrived very late, Laurel and Skye made our check-in easy and had left some lights on to show us the way. The bungalow is very well appointed and  we found everything neat, tidy and very clean. We would definitely recommend this lease to other visitor to Oakland.
The check-in procedure was super easy. The bed was very comfortable for 2 people, and my husband especially enjoyed the mini fridge stocked with refreshments :) The shared backyard space was also really well styled and we enjoyed sitting on the deck drinking coffee in the mornings. We had lots of privacy and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful.
Dennis Steward's place was just what I needed! Having privacy in the bedroom was great and having the bathroom in the there was such a nice touch. I loved the location!
It is a close drive from major sights like Fisherman’s Wharf but you can walk it too. He is prompt with responses and helpful in ensuring a pleasant trip. We will definitely be returning!
A couple things to note are that it is nice they provide bicycles,  just know that they are older. One great thing about this area is the bike path on the beach that goes all the way to Santa Monica. There are 2 rental places close by.
There's no wonder why she's called a SUPERHOST and always booked! We are not AirBnB veterans, only having used it a couple of times, with somewhat mixed results. If it were like this every time, we would use it a LOT more.
I would highly recommend staying at Paul's cottage! Paul's guest house was very clean, nicely decorated and well stocked. My wife and I really enjoyed using the bikes and beach chairs that were provided.
The bathroom is clean and bright with a strong, rejuvenating shower. A most remarkable aspect of our stay was the surprisingly numerous items that are available for use, from makeup mirror to the fantastic 3-speed cruiser bicycles, that made our stay so much easier and more pleasant. If you happen to leave something behind, there’s an excellent chance Angela already has it stocked in her place.
When we wanted to stay an additional day, he couldn’t accommodate us because the guesthouse was already rented out for the next day but he made a few calls and found us another Airbnb to stay in! The actual guesthouse was so cute, comfortable, and clean! My boyfriend and I look forward to the next time we can get back to California and stay here again.
Very easy transportation for Lyft/Uber, which is what we used exclusively while we were there. Never had to wait more than 20 minutes for pick-up. Outside of surge pricing, average cost of Uber trips was around $15 (for somewhere in Oakland/the Bay) up to around $20 (if you wanted to make the trek over the bridge to someplace in San Francisco).
Our four days at this incredible loft were some of our favorite traveling days to date! The loft is amazing, clean, and spacious. We enjoyed coffee on the terrace overlooking the street.
Bed was so comfy, I slept great! Shower was awesome with great pressure and filled with all the shampoo, conditioner and bodywash you could need. Apple TV was great for Cher Alexander before bed.
Brian and Sarah's place was one of the nice so far. They even stocked breakfast basic (Including Coffee) so we did not have to drive or walk anywhere until we were ready. Their place was immaculate and so very comfortable.
With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. Brian Burns was extremely flexible in allowing us to book the night before to accommodate for our 6:30am flight arrival from Sydney so we could drop our bags, have a shower and settle in - he even left the lights on for us and gave us very straightforward check in instructions. He has some great tips for what to do around town, however a quick walk or bike ride up the beach will bring you to the great restaurant of Redondo, Hermosa and Manhattan beaches.
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. This is the BEST Airbnb we have ever stayed in - in the US and in the world. Lovely!!
The little treats and awesome tv options were great for evenings in with our little guy. Lastly, the fact that you picked us up a pack and play for our little guy to sleep was so so kind of you. Best host ever!
Michael is the most welcoming and friendly host. Check-In was super easy. He showed me the flat and gave recommendations when I arrived.
Great location! Coco loved the beach and hopefully we will be back in 2020 with both kiddos (hopefully the cottage!)
She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella.
I really liked all of the gluey notes, those were extremely helpful especially for the shower. Unfortunately, we were gone most of the days really early and got back later in the day so we didn’t have time to meet her, but was super helpful at answering my questions via inbox. We were in a construction zone, so we had to reroute ourselves but that’s my only small complaint!
Crystal Romero's place was much more than expected. Slept amazing and very close to local attraction such as the Redondo Beach Pier, local restaurants and cute little boutique shops. Definitely will be staying here again if I'm ever needing a place in the Redondo Beach area.
Within walking distance of restaurants, grocery stores, cocktail lounges, beach, everything. Had such an amazing time at this air bnb. Angela goes out of her way to make her guests feel welcome,  from fresh squeezed orange juice in the fridge to face masks in the bathroom.
The vicinity is so quiet and safe. It’s truly restful .
Traci is a professional chef, and she leaves out breakfast options that make 'continental' blush. They had a couple of bikes for us to use, which made getting around town easy and enjoyable. We got in quite late from the airport, and had no trouble checking in.
The washer/dryer hook up is handy for cleaning your clothes. We also needed a ride to the grocery store that next morning (around 9 am). Instead of having us take an Uber, Joelle even drove us to the store herself & waited for us to finish shopping to take us home.
Chuck was the most gracious, funny, warming, magical host. Don’t hesitate. Book.
He has thought about all kind of small details that make your stay really pleasant. Whenever I go back I’m hoping to stay there again.
We loved the location away from the hustle and bustle of Tacoma, but still close enough to go into town for the day. Wonderful place to stay! Very nice house with a beautiful view.
The house itself is  about 2 blocks off the beach. Literally a 3 minute walk ( I think it takes longer to cross the wide sand beach to the ocean's edge than it does to get from the room to the beach). I.
The cottage is just lovely, the kind of place you want to wrap up at the end of the holiday and take back home with you! The cottage is stocked with just about everything you could possibly want for your stay with plenty of thoughtful touches (edible and otherwise). Would love to come and stay here again in the future.
Thanks,  Crystal Romero! Would definitely recommend this garden cottage! Great for 1-2 people, the space is private, intimate, and relaxing.
I am long legged so my only complaint was how close the toilet was to the wall when sitting down ;) the patio was amazing! Will definitely recommend to future guests! Thank you, Neva!
Pleasant, clean room and bath. Quiet, safe neighborhood with an excellent Italian restaurant and several coffee shops within easy walking distance. Bed was comfortable with smooth, soft  linens.
Clifford Winkler home was warm, inviting, and so clean. Edward Ramsey made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. A fantastic place for a nice relaxing get away.
Parking was no issue. Kim & Taj were quick in responding when I booked this space months prior and very thorough in check in/out instructions several days before arriving. Would stay here again in a pulse and wish I could call that little space home!
We arrived a bit earlier than expected and my phone failed to send the ETA message to Sierra but she let us drop our things off and freshen up which was deeply appreciated. It was quiet and had plenty of street parking. The apartment itself was cutely decorated and very homelike .
It is so close to many amazing restaurants and cafes. Public transport into the city was no problem at all, it was about half an hour to most tourists destinations including union square, fisherman’s wharf and golden gate bridge. Michael Krieg and Rocky provided an amazing home away from Home in San Francisco.
Great location with easy distance to tons of restaurants & activities. Jerry & Julie have created a masterpiece with this home. First, its location is in a quiet and scenic neighborhood, and the views of the Sound will immediately draw you to the back patios for relaxation.
We were only a 5 minute walk away from the beach and just a hop away from a variety of great places to eat and drink. Francis Jones made great recommendations for us and we are so appreciative of the attentiveness. They think of every small detail!
Looking forward to next time! The place is excellent. We didn't have any problem to get to it.
Nathan is an incredibly gracious host. Wrigley field is minutes away, along with amazing restaurants and coffee shops!
Don’t hesitate. It. Right.
We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing. The apartment was very clean with lovely quality towels that we nice and fluffy. It had a book of local info which was helpful and was very conveniently location to restaurants and a few shops.
John Mullins had ready for us a cheese plate, some sparkling wine, and chocolates! She also rented a pair of nice bikes to us for free! The cabin is small, but John Mullins has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay.
Maggie’s place was the best Airbnb apartment I’ve ever been to. The apartment is about 10 minutes walk away to the following subway station and you need about 40 minutes to the Times Square with the subway. Maggie and her husband were always there when we needed something and even came downstairs to help us.
Bennie Dudgeon also had thoughtful extras such as a basket of travel items in case guests forgot something - which I did so I appreciated the lotion. She has a air conditioning unit as well as space heater which was perfect. The bungalow is wonderfully located a few blocks from the beach and close to shops, restaurants, and groceries.
Maggie has a comfortable and very nicely furnished apartment. The bedrooms are very spacious, and well equipped. The kitchen is very well  equipped with everything you need.
Being kind of young, we were a bit apprehensive about meeting him, but he put us at ease completely. He was completely un-creepy, which can sometimes be hard to find in older men as an East Asian - American. I appreciated his conversation and his excitement at sharing the house with us.
.I will high recommend this room. Elizabeth home was awesome! It felt homey, feels like home.
Louise was such a wonderful host - even though we only crossed paths in person once, her warmth showed through all of her communications with me. Super cozy and comfortable bed, the space heater quickly took care of the chilly nights, lots of little touches like tea and snacks. I would absolutely stay here again if I find myself back in the area!
My boyfriend and I stayed at the Little House for 2 nights, on President's Day weekend (also my birthday!). The house was ADORABLE and so so comfortable. We didn't get to visit with Erica much,  but she was so sweet and hospitable, even from the sidelines.
It is convenient to shops and restaurants. It is also very convenient to the complimentary Link rail system so you can get all the way to the Tacoma Dome or other attractions like the Museum of Glass in a few minutes. The accommodations are comfortable, clean, and soothing.
We found everyone (including Heather) to be extremely helpful to the extent that when we got off the bus we found drivers would often get off with us and talk us through where we would need to go to be picked back up again. I would 100% go back and stay again. The lone thing I would mention is not to bother buying your own guide book of San Francisco, there are loads in the apartment to use with local maps and Heathers own recommendation .
Danielle’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line.
I definitely recommend to stay at their place Cara’s Airbnb is one of the best we’ve stayed in. For a studio the place is organized very well that it still felt spacious.
Having the peaceful outdoor area also added to a great experience! Overall, I highly recommend staying at the Carriage House especially if you are looking for a quiet and easy access to a beach getaway!
i was really impressed by all the small thoughtful touches that made the space feel incredibly homey and not just a place to sleep. i can't say enough good things about her and her space. we would definitely come back!
Highly recommended. Just perfect. The place was easy to find, with adequate places to park.
We especially enjoyed the close proximity to shop , the beach and use of your Beach Cruisers !!! A very comfortable place with a very pleasant and accommodating host. Located in a quiet, nice neighborhood, it is within walking distance of many shops and restaurants.
Francis Jones is a kind, friendly host. She made it easy to access the room ahead of the advertised check-in time. The room is clean and spacious with a nice private bathroom, a balcony and a large satellite TV.
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. She even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy by the fire! Angela was incredibly hospitable and all of the little touches really made the weekend.
The desk has been moved closer to the door, which makes it a convenient spot to place your keys or bags. The bed was big and soft and we honestly fell in love with the comforter. Parking is available on and off the street, and the property is gated!
We were able to walk to the beach restaurants and she even provided some great locations we would not have found on our own. We appreciated all of the extra touches and would book again in a heartbeat! This host is one you should not pass up!
This is a such a quaint little spot nestled in an area that has so much to offer via walking distance and within a short drive. I'm a light sleeper and had no problem getting an awesome night rest after a show. Lots of really great thoughtful touches in the room that made it feel homey that I don't usually see in many other places.
This is exactly how it’s described! Its got everything and anything you could want. Tiana was antic with communication and always responded immediately.
It rained the majority of our weekend, which made our night even more special. So relaxing, and cozy! Highly recommend.
The lovely courtyard with fish pond and plants is spectacular and the on site laundry much appreciated. The location was particularly close to family for us, but we were also close to public transportation system , loved walking to the many nearby shops and restaurants and found parking to be no problem. Mike and Ben were very attentive to our need and have become good friends.
When someone says "My house is your house" very rarely is it true, but it certainly was during our stay at Elizabeth. She took the time to drop us to whole foods which was just about 15 minutes away from the house by walk, not because we expected it, but it was a spur of the moment indication of what kind of host she would be. The bedroom and closet were spacious.
I loved my getaway and plan to come back for more stays. If you are looking for a place in this area, THIS is the place to reserve! Outstanding hospitality, quick communication, a super stylish space, sparkling clean, full of local ideas for exploring and most impressive to me were the myriad of amazing amenities provided...you'll find an umbrella, thank you notes, paper, lots of soft blankets to curl up on the couch with, games, cards, puzzles, DVDs, book , a back scratcher, batteries, every imaginable toiletry in case you are lacking some, extra sheets and bed pillows, fans to keep cool if need be, a stocked kitchen with everything you need to cook and a bevy of items to make for breakfast, chocolates by the bedside, a bbq grill on a lovely patio and so much more.
Luke was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The futon included a couple of foam toppers which made it very comfortable for my daughter. The neighbor felt safe, kids playing basketball, couples taking walks chatting over the fence, the smell off Bbqs.
This topographic point was perfect for our one night stay! Dennis Steward even had a bantam sewing kit  available for me when I ripped my jeans... would definitely stay here again :)
We will definitely be back. Angela exemplifies a super host! She is welcoming, and thoughtful, and spent our entire time there making sure we were having a great stay.
Other AirBNB places I've rented are more like alternative motel lodging, but this is what I imagine what a traditional bed and breakfast must be like. In addition, Zeena was very accommodating about my special request to check in very late due to attending a late night music event. There is a band named "Charming Hostess" that is related to the music I heard -- they were not present that night, but their title was instead ably filled by Zeena.
Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future.
Me and my husband stayed at Angela’s place for our honeymoon trip and everything was absolutely perfect. This was our first Airbnb experience and she set the bar pretty high. We have never been to California before but it was no problem because she had plenty of recommendations for us from restaurants to activities.
There were sweet little surprises everywhere: a record player and exciting record collection, super cozy beds, romantic twinkle lights, games, puzzles, wise handwritten quotes, unique handmade furniture, fascinating screen printing supplies, ect. Though it wasn’t far from home, it truly was the restful weekend away that my friends and I needed. If you are looking for a break from the buzz of life, I can’t recommend this studio highly enough.
Noe Valley is the best area when you dont want the hustle and bustle from Fishermens Warff. The appartment is really spacious and you even have a beautifull and nice smelling garden. Pegg made us homemade chocolade bit cookies and left it at the appartment when we went out.
Me and my husband stayed in Melia’s Casita for a weekend for our anniversary and I must stay, it more than exceeded our expectations! Melia was an amazing host, she put fresh fruit for us, coffee, milk, snacks, and more. She was also very responsive and we had a lovely time chatting with her.
Food around the neighbourhood was fantastic! It cost us less than 10USD to travel anywhere. We will def choose this place again if we visit SF.
We even spent some time fishing on Lake Whitehurst which is located on the property. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back to visit in a heartbeat! We had an amazing family getaway!
We stayed at Ron and Laurie’s place when we were helping with day care for our granddaughter in the area. Ron greeted us warmly, showed us around,, and made us feel very welcome! Their place was really lovely with many special touches!
This little cottage is a great find, and Michelle is an incredibly generous host. There was a wide variety of breakfast food, and even some snack food. I stay in a lot of Airbnbs, and many do not provide these items.
Traci is a professional chef, and she leaves out breakfast option that make 'continental' blush. They're often around for suggestion , recommendations, and local knowledge. I would have liked to stay longer!
The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were lots of little extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of games for us to play after a long day on our foot . I was in town for the NeoCon Conference and the Coach House was the perfect escape from all the busy at the end of my photoshoot. I traveled with my mom and my kids and we were comfortable, delighted, and fell in love with the area.
Lots of beach toys available on site to use. Thank u Tiana for ur kindness and thoughtfulness- I will return! Christopher Brown
I cannot believe how special and wonderful Angela’s space was! She goes above and beyond to create an experience that is special for guests. I cannot wait to come back!
You won't regret it. Joan Litwin is such a incredible host. She is so lovely and friendly everyday.
I was the only person in the apartment which was fine; good for a few days stay. Having the refrigerator and microwave was handy. I had no issue with street noise as some other renters commented.
Thomas George gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tip so we loved that. I saw a previous reappraisal about noise but we heard nothing at all. There's very little traffic and we never heard the other guests.
However, this ended up being something I loved. This space is the perfect place to do deep reflection and be present in your thoughts. I grew to really appreciate not having the distraction of a television.
Everything was found just as described. Shantell Preusser is super nice and lovely to talk to. She makes sure everything is on point.
Book this topographical point now! The view from the patio is dramatic . Communication was great, Marcia got back to us within minutes of reaching out.
Chris & Tim's place was great for my week and half stay in the Virginia Beach Area. The cottage is surrounded by beautiful trees and plants and there are many parks to explore in the area too. The cottage itself was very nice and had a nice homey feeling to it.
Anne's apartment is a terrific value, and I would definitely stay there again (I've already recommended it to my sister, who's planning a trip). It's a lovely, spacious, beautifully decorated space in a great and safe location. Easy walk to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc.
Raquel Eastham thoughtful, speedy  attentiveness made the lodging part of our trip an effortless high point. James Walker is an outstanding host and went above and beyond setting up her home for an amazing stay. First of all, the open floor plan, warm lighting, and inviting atmosphere was very welcoming & made us feel right at home.
I was looking simply for a place to rest at the end of the day. I didn’t need a car and easily used Lyft to get me anywhere I needed to go. The location is safe and beautifully landscaped.
Very hospitable. Beautiful apartment and great location for Queens and day trips to Manhattan. We will definitely be returning.
She let us drop off our bags a few hours early before her already already check-in which was great! The check- inch and check-out process was extremely easy. The location was pretty good, about a 15-20 minute walk to River North area.
This beautiful loft was much bigger in person and everything about this space exceeded our expectations. His taste in music was awesome, he woke up and started his day positive and that vibe rubbed off on all of us. My son is 6 and this was the perfect rental for his age.
Was a perfect start to our roadtrip. Look forward to coming back someday!
We had a great stay at T’s this past weekend! Joseph Lewis: The only thing I do want to mention, as one of the main reasons we booked this Airbnb was because it was listed as “step free”, is that there is a small step to enter the Airbnb that I was not able to independently navigate in my manual wheelchair. Still a 5 star Airbnb - but would be important for other wheelchair users to know.
They do a great job of recommending restaurant , shops and nightlife all within walking distance which is just one less thing you have to worry about. If it is available, book this topographic point without hesitation.
 bungalow is larger than it appears in photos and has a lovely private patio with seating. Kitchen is stocked with cookware, spices, cooking oil, a few staples, and breakfast items which made mealtime easy and economical. Walk out of the cottage in any direction and there are things to do and lovely residential neighborhoods to stroll.
If you happened to forget something before arriving, the house likely has a clean spare of what you need (toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc). We were not left short for anything. The location: This is a perfect example of a place that is really close to bustling downtown area without being right in the middle of the chaos.
The inside space was lovely and very comfortable. Bath is smallish and up a couple stairs, but nice. The kitchenette was just right and had everything one could need to make light meals.
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Joan Litwin and Tim's cottage. Just being inside and examining the decor was entertaining in of itself. My husband and I travel a lot and I can say conclusively this was the most adorable place we have ever stayed in.
Hope to be back again in the summer calendar month ! This is an incredible space! Great location and very comfortable.
Great place if you’re trying to walk to beach, truly felt like a little home for my girlfriend and I for the week. The shared patio was a really nice place to relax after a day at the beach, the area is nice with a relaxed vibe and it was so much fun playing with her puppy!! !
Luke was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. A little patio to have coffee and watch the birds was nice. Very clean!
From the lavish towel to the incredibly comfortable beds, you will immediately feel welcome. The views are breathtaking. This is a must see and must stay home if you’re in the Tacoma area!
Great topographic point to stay in a great location. Shantell Preusser was very responsive when I had question . The topographic point was very clean and cozy.
Hairdryer, straighteners, mini fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks, amazing bath and hair products, even phone chargers on both sides of the bed. The living area upstairs is beautiful, with an amazing view of SF from the balcony. Tyler and his partner were both very hospitable, even invited us to have a glass of champagne when Tyler’s family came over to visit.
! The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies.
Better than the first. From making the keys available to us (she was out of town) and then having a family member check on us to make sure all was well, everything was first class. The cottage was very clean, all comforts were available and useable, and the serenity was very appreciated.
I needed to steam my clothes and they provided me with a steamer. I was able to walk were I needed because the location is perfect and so convenient. I will definitely come back every time I’m in New York.
I'm not going to bury the lede on this one: the toilet lights up. That's all I needed to start the petition for 10 stars on Airbnb. Now to the boring part of the review: Bob and Sharann's suite was exactly what I was looking for on my one-night stay.
You can’t miss if you are lucky enough to stay at Paul’s topographic point . It is beautifully appointed and spotless. You can walk to beach and restaurants.
Linda was so warm and also helped us with our bags. The photos of this place do not do justice to how lovely, warm and full of thoughtful touches it is. A big plus for me was the private washroom which was not only sparkling clean and extremely spacious but also full of all amenities one would need.
Marc was very helpful at check in, the place was well stocked, getting to ride the bikes and having a parking pass was very thoughtful. Tammy’s place was perfect. It was clean, great location- so close to the beach, airport, awesome amenities, private.
We were able to walk to the beach restaurants and she even provided some great locations we would not have found on our own. We appreciated all of the extra touches and would book again in a pulse ! This host is one you should not pass up!
Super convenient. We were so incredibly lucky to find this place. This was a girls trip and none of us had ever been to Chicago before.
This place was exactly as shown in the pictures! At first we struggled hard to find parking but Aaron’s instructions on parking are pretty clear and very helpful. The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Aaron’s place and convenient!
We loved our stay at Neva's! Neva was an incredible host and even recommended a great local place for lunch. We definitely recommend!
I will definitely be coming back here. Great value for the price. Highly recommend.
Very clean, private quiet place minutes from the HB pier. Marc was very helpful at check in, the place was well stocked, getting to ride the bikes and having a parking pass was very thoughtful. If parking, pay attention to where you are allowed to park on what days to avoid any tickets, the streets are clearly marked on what days the street cleaners come.
I really can't find a individual thing to list here that I didn't like. Absolutely fantastic .
Edwin Green and Kurt are the perfect hosts and such lovely people we really felt at home with them. The down side to our stay.... nothing at all! Other than we had to come home.
Brent is very responsive and available to provide any help and answer any questions. Everything about our stay was wonderful. The place was very clean and had everything we needed!Katherine has put time and effort into the thoughtful details of the offer of her Airbnb.
Huge library of books to choose from with all sorts of genera. We would love to come back! We had a great time!
We loved this location and appreciated the quiet neighborhood with the conveniency of being minutes from the airport. We certainly needed a good remainder and the pillows and linens were great. I'd love to stay again if I ever find myself in the Seattle Tacoma area.
The room is very spacious, bed is incredibly comfy, bathroom is spotless, and there is parking on premises. Excellent! Thank you!
The place was beautiful and sparkling clean. Lovely and super responsive and caring hosts.
They leave a detailed guide of local spots to check out along with estimated walking/driving times-- Alfred's Cafe across the street is a great spot for breakfast (get the Biscuits and gravy--chorizo gravy FTW). This will be one of the first AirBnB I will check when I head back to Tacoma.
We are so glad that we chose to stay there. We visited San Francisco on our honeymoon and weren't  sure what to expect since neither one of us had ever been to the west coast. We completely fell in love with it!
Scott and Jill are wonderful hosts who worked extremely responsively with us as our scheduled arrival changed. They helped us figure out some of the neighborhoods we were looking for an apartment, gave us some tips on cool places to eat, and introduced us to their sweet doggo, Bonnie. Their garage loft is a lovely, very clean space in a very quiet neighborhood.
Loved the little back yard oasis where our daughter enjoyed taking some amazing pictures. Thank you for letting us use your washer, dryer and the scale. We were so glad that we got to meet you, your husband Stan and your so called ‘naughty’ dog (which he was so not!).
I have had the pleasure of staying here multiple times and always have had my expectations met. I’ve always stayed multiple nights but even  just an overnight would feel special too!
This our go-to place for vacation! It’s always ridiculously clean and so comfortable, and Mark and Tammy couldn’t be better hosts! Location is quiet both early in the day and at night, and so centrally located.
Rooms are neat and tidy, perfect place to stay with family. We will definitely stay again in our next visit to LA.
Elizabeth is very friendly, helpful and thoughtful . Her home is in a great neighborhood, safe, quiet, close to beach. We will definitely stay at her home again.
Michael thinks of everything, anticipating his guests' every need. He also directed up to a website that gave us a parking garage just three minutes' walk away that was only $20 for 24 hours. Unbelievable!
We could not have been more pleased. Look forward to staying there again!! Did I mention how clean it was :)
We loved the thoughtful things like coffee, some bottles of water, nice fluffy towel and really comfy bed! We had an amazing trip and this place definitely helped. So great, we would definitely stay again.
Paul's place was even better than we expected. I knew it was going to be a great home from the sterling reviews, but I was still surprised to find this stylish space that is equipped with every little essentials left there by a very thoughtful host. Check-in instructions were easy to follow.
We were traveling with our crawling 9-month-old and that’s always a little worrisome for a young mom, but Nina had the place so amazingly clean, it was fantastic. There is also a closet of toys for kids, covering a great age range. Some items my kiddo enjoyed, but things for older kids too.
It is amazing everything you might have forgotten to bring he has and shares with you. A true godsend when you are many mile from home! Would love to come again when we can really enjoy all the house has to offer and relax and not march to a wedding’s timetable!
There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses.
Their neighborhood is in an ideal location within walking distance of numerous excellent restaurants, as well as BART. I highly recommend Pam and Richard's place!
I loved this listing. From check-in to check-out, it was easy. The cafe downstairs was a great way to jumpstart our mornings.
We were so pleased with everything else, we would forfeit those for what we did have. It was extremely clean and we had shampoo and soap (also important to us). The towels were plenty for us and thankful for an extra one just in case we needed it.
We also love the compost toilet.....very easy to use, hygienic, no odor and very ecological. Don’t let this put you off! Sequoiah, you have created such a special place!
We even spent some time fishing on Lake Whitehurst which is located on the property. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back to visit in a pulse ! We had an amazing family getaway!
My husband and I were thrilled that we decided to stay in Gig Harbor for our anniversary weekend. The location felt like a secret hideaway, with Zeena's designer touches making it feel warm and inviting. Having breakfast served both days was so very particular .
My girlfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful stay at Paul's guest house. We especially appreciated using the bikes to ride along the beach in the morning. I would recommend staying here.
When we almost missed our connector flight she was willing to accommodate early morning arrival. The room was great! Huge space and nice bathroom!
She made for a great stay. I highly recommend this place.
The location is ideal. Speakingof motorcycle , they are a great amenity. I'm not a big cyclist, but I took Lindsay Brown suggestion and biked along the  boardwalk.
Paul was so nice, we felt like we knew him for old age . I can’t wait to go back. Thank you, Paul.
Christina was a great host and made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable. The location of the house was antic - it was 15 minutes or less from grocery stores, 24 hour fitness, parks, hiking trails, movie theaters, restaurants, etc. Parking in the neighborhood was no issue at all.
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. There were also little surprises of snacks and drinks that awaited us when we came in which was awesome. Seriously, if you’re ever in San Francisco, you simply have to book this place!
It has such fun style and great layout for solo or couples traveling. It was so nice to walk to Berkeley Bowl for grocery and then come back, make dinner, share a bottle of wine and watch a movie before turning in for the night. Francis Jones and Debra Dibble are lovely and so kind.
Heather's Cozy Cottage is wonderful! First of all, she gives excellent directions, the exterior of the house is well lit (easy to find at night), and there is excellent off-street parking (we parked our full-size Nissan Titan without any difficulties!). Additionally, she gave personal service, meeting us with the key, and walking use through the features of the home.
We had a fantastic stay in Laurel and Sky’s lovely cottage. Even though we arrived very late, Laurel and Skye made our check-in easy and had left some light on to show us the way. They kindly checked in with us the next day to see if we needed anything.
Neva was so sweet! Thank you Neva!
The space can fit up to 4 people! My daughter and I really felt at home. Very easy check-in and Stephanie is super responsive and helpful.
My lady and I took an evening stroll down 6th street and perused the many restaurants and shops. Though we didn't dine, ASADO looked intriguing as did the Vietnamese restaurant (name escapes me). The quaint pubs and vintage shops along 6th ave were closed for the night but looked promising.
Thanks again. The room is superb - extremely spacious, clean and comfortable. Its location is convenient, walking distance to the Redondo Beach.
We also enjoyed our walk to Hermosa Beach (about one hour leisurely walk for roundtrip) and drinking coffee in the backyard. Thanks again Neva for sharing your studio with us!
Pure delight!! I highly recommend booking T's place for your stay in Redondo Beach. From the initial communication and all the way through my stay she was exceptionally responsive and accommodating to all of our need .
The space was cozy and private, just two blocks from the beach. The bathroom and bedroom space were extremely clean and had everything we could have needed (anything from coffee, excess beach towels, sunblock, bottle opener, etc.). I couldn’t have asked for a better experience!
This space is a perfect little place right near the beach. Parking was easy and the hosts even had left a little chair and sand toys for my little girl. We really enjoyed this stay.
i was really impressed by all the small thoughtful touches that made the space feel incredibly homelike and not just a place to sleep. thank you, angela!
Amazing location with amazing hosts! George & Colleen are so helpful and assisted us promptly whenever we needed help! The house was cosy and beautiful, & it’s so nicely decorated!
Super cozy bedding so we all slept well. Some extra little touches like some beverages and snacks were a nice touch too. Would highly recommend.
If I come visit LA again soon, I'd stay there again. The backyard is relaxing as well. It's close to Manhattan Beach, Redondo, Palos Verdes and Hermosa!
They were super quiet at night, too. I would absolutely suggest this place to others! We will definitely stay here again.
Def will keep this one on our list to revisit! Lots of small details that made my short stay worth the drive outside of LAX airport area. I would stay here again!
The location is perfect for enjoying many of Oakland's prime area . We had a wonderful stay. The only couple of items I would mention that could be improved are we had trouble working the shades on the windows, and the hot water in the shower seemed to run out a bit too quickly.
Brian and Sarah’s place is exactly how it looks in the pictures! It was bright, clean, and beautiful. The space is perfect for 3-4 people.
She offered several times to take us to the grocery store and even to take us to a place where we were going to have dinner. Such an amazing lady!! <3 Cottage was warm, cozy, clean and comfortable.
Edwin Green was wonderful, the bungalow was perfect, cozy, had everything we needed, and was in a great location! She had bikes to use to bike around town, we loved that! There are some great spot nearby, we took the motorcycle up to el segundo, fun brunch spots, this area has it all.
Pat was up in the morning with coffee which my husband enjoyed. There was a private bathroom for guests with toiletries. Check in was easy.
Wow, if you are looking for an oasis in the center of fast paced downtown Tacoma- THIS is the place for you! Gloria's place is beautiful, so spacious and has everything you could ever  really want in a home away from home. Gloria is also very responsive and makes sure you have everything you need which is so nice.
We had brought chargers for our telephone , but those were also provided right beside the bed. It was the type of airbnb where you truly did not need to bring anything. We showed up earlier then check in time so Tyler was great about letting us leave our stuff while we went to go explore San Francisco.
As someone visiting LA for a couple days, I wanted to be close to the beach and this place definitely had it. It was perfect for me traveling alone but know that you basically have just the bed and a tiny bathroom. Neva does an AWESOME job though of making a small space into something great-- There was a desk to work at in one corner, a microwave, mini-fridge, and keurig in another, and then a tv with apple-tv on the other corner!
Check-in with Bob and Sharann was outstanding. He even helped carry our luggage in...completely unexpected! We have family in the area who live in a small apartment so we just needed a place to sleep.
The biggest plus was the cardinal location of the home. Easy access to anything around the city. Go to Janes around the corner for breakfast, coffee or lunch!
It is quiet and clean. We appreciate the little details and thank you for always willing to help when I needed.
It remained nice and warm inside even as it snowed. We had fun flipping through your “Books of Knowledge” on your bookcase and laughed as some passages seemed more like common sense. The bed was incredibly soft and comfortable.
Listening to live jam sessions was an added bonus! Thanks, Lori Stewart and Betty Maust!
John Brashier and Lenora were amazing hosts and their hospitality is off the chart . The check-in process was seamless. The entire house was clean, cozy and Elizabeth Jones and all the amenities you could possibly think of were on offer: coffee/tea maker, bottled water, soap, shampoo, towels, iron, ironing board, fans etc........
Games in room for families, a few waters, soft drink and snacks also provided. Whole Foods, restaurant widely available nearby.
Neva was super quick with communication and happy to help with anything we needed. We felt right at home in her stunning little bungalow.
Maggie & John are so wonderful and accommodating! Maggie was ever so accommodating! We had a late flight out and wanted to explore Queens & Flushing before heading to JKF, but had no where to store our luggage.
The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemons! And the hot tub... what a treat. You will love staying here!
Most of all, we loved chatting to Jenny and Mark on the morning we left. Although we only stayed for one night, it was a really memorable one. Thank you!
A severe snow storm came through Tacoma while we were staying and she made sure we had breakfast and gave advice when it was best to continue on our journey. When the storm subsided the view across the bay was astounding. Wish we  could have spent more time at The Shipwatch Retreat.
Chip communicated quickly and easily and made our stay in Vashon a stress free one. The house is right by the water with a beautiful view. It does get pretty cold at night but there's a cute fire heater.
We had to (Hidden by Airbnb) how to work the small stove heater (we didn’t realize the pan/pot needed to be on the surface before it would work) but hey! Trent was ecstatic that you had three different contraptions to brew coffee (he prefers the French press) and did a very childish happy dance when he saw you had fancy sugar cubes. Thank you for providing tea, by the way.
He went out of his manner to check in with us to make certain we were enjoying our stay and had everything we needed. Like a good neighbor! He obviously takes good care of this space.
The cabin is small, but Angela has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay. There’s even a fenced in patio to enjoy the sun during the day or a small fire at night. Angela made sure we were fully equipped to have a fun and relaxing few days, and at the same time made a point to give us privacy.
Neighborhood was very nice and quiet. I was able to feel the ocean breeze. House was beautiful.
This home is in a great location, a few block from the pier and a short Uber ride from LAX. Rayford Kelly is an amazing hostess. She makes her guests feel at home, comfortable, and safe.
Very respectfully in giving us our space but very accommodating to all our needs. This was like visiting family in the best way possible. Linda greeted us and I immediately felt at home.
Location can’t be beat, right smack dab in Chicago. The apartment is cozy, I wanted a bit more heat and after texting to ask Anne, she said yes I can adjust the thermostat. The bed is comfy, no weird smells in the building or apartment.
Igor is nice and quick in response, and we really thank him for keeping our luggages even after check-out time. Hi just stayed at igors place for 4nights it’s a shared house and in a very nice area but we managed to find our way round using combination of buses and metro . So only a short bus ride and tube to central New York in about 25 minutes.
Was a perfect start to our roadtrip. Jeremy Johnson was very helpful and made checking in really easy. Would recommend to anyone World Health Organization wants to unwind for a few days.
Stepping into Tyler’s apartment was like walking into a luxurious hotel, but better. He really has thought of everything and has equipped the room and en-suite with all the necessities for guests. The highlights being the delicious coffee machine, locally-sourced soaps and the very comfortable bed.
Clifford Winkler’s place is everything you want in a stay away from home. Only a few blocks from the ocean, it’s also in a great location. Highly recommended!
Before I been there, the host sent me  a lot of note to help me find this house. My husband and I stayed here for four nights during our stay in LA, and this was one of the best airbnbs we have ever stayed in! The home is beautiful, spotless, and spacious!
How are we supposed to describe in words the MOST AMAZING BB COUPLE we've ever met?? Leonora and Teresa Knight are the best!! Kind, helpful, caring, great conversation .
Einfach nur perfekt! Pamela Drew waren perfekte Gastgeber. Wir kommen gerne wieder!!
Gregory Simons’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Gregory Simons gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars.
I took him to Disneyland on day 3 and she gave us all the tips to navigate the park and probably saved us hours with her inside knowledge. Elizabeth Jones Bungalow was exactly how we thought it would be, amazing! She was such a great host starting from check in, she checked in on us mid manner through our trip and when we checked out.
The desk has been moved closer to the door, which makes it a convenient spot to place your keys or bags. The bed was large and soft and we honestly fell in love with the comforter. Parking is available on and off the street, and the property is gated!
I would give Elizabeth’s home more than 5 stars if possible, what a perfect place to stay! This home is stylish, well appointed, comfy and incredibly clean. Location is desirable and my stay felt very private.
Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy vicinity around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.
Really nice down to earth hosts that go out of their manner to be certain you are comfortable and have all you need. I’ll be back I’m sure. ;)
She was extremely friendly and gave us a tour to make certain we knew where everything was, including many extra pillows, blankets, and towels. She and her husband live on the property and were available in case we needed anything, but the home was so well-stocked we didn't have any problem ! The hot tub and pool were especially relaxing, and we loved hanging out with their extremely friendly dogs.
Our experience at Nina's is going to be hard for any other AirBNB host to beat! We'll be back for sure.
We will definitely be back again !! Jennifer Merry for being available so quickly to answer the questions we had and for making our stay so enjoyable! You NEED to stay (Website hidden by Airbnb) is simply beautiful...!
We loved our cozy room, the art and decor was so unique, the location was perfect, and the rooftop patio was a great bonus. It’s probably even better in the warmer months, as we saw Michael’s seed collection laid out for spring planting, but we still enjoyed it! Michael even gave us his wool blanket for the baseball game we attended— very thoughtful and kind.
Friendly, quick to respond. Very helpful with recommendations and very accommodating. They made us feel very welcome and taken care of.
The entrance way and outside sitting area surrounded by tall bamboo added to the charm. This is a place I would return to in a minute.
So only a short bus ride and tube to central New York in about 25 minutes. The house is very well looked after and is clean and tidy but we did feel like we should be quiet and that made it a little weird. But they made us feel welcome and we would recommend.
It was a bit on the costly side but that was because it had all of the amenities of being in a hotel. We had brought chargers for our phones, but those were also provided right beside the bed. The room also had an apple TV that was great for kicking back and watching something while watching dinner.
Clifford Winkler is a kind, friendly host. She was a responsive, caring host. I'd definitely stay with her again!
What a treat! The bed(s) are comfy, the shower has great water pressure, there is a nice little sitting patio with string lights, and there are many thoughtful touches throughout the space. The location is excellent, right near the beach and easily walkable/bikeable/Uber-able.
We hope to come back soon! Angela absolutely nailed it. When we arrived she was there to greet us with candles lit and a kitchen stocked with beer and snacks (both regular and gluten-free) just like a hotel.
I will absolutely be returning to San Francisco, and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else! Heather’s place is just as pictured and is in a beautiful, scenic location right across from Ocean Beach. She had a nice bottle of wine & some yummy chocolates waiting for us on arrival.
Scott was very hospitable and friendly, and made us feel right at home. Overall a 5-star experience!
We took full advantage of all the neighborhood had to offer, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping and more using reference material provided by the hosts. Thank you for sharing with us.
Everything is as described on the webpage. Loved staying here! It was quiet and so close to so many fabulous shop , cafe and restaurants.
The position was to die for!! She was quick to answer and had everything we could even want! We loved the snacks that she provided as well as the convince of the honor barroom that was fully stocked!
It's super clean and comfortable, feels very private, and came stocked with breakfast items, extra tolitries, and sparkling water, all which were great touches. The bed was too firm for my back (though my husband loved it) and Sheri Vowell graciously set up the airbed for me. She also let us stash our luggage for a few hours after checking out, which was kind and very helpful.
Jeni was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area. The 2 bedrooms were nicely sized & the master had huge closets. It’s always nice to have linen & towels provided as well!
We were a small surprised that he popped by to say 'hello' twice before 10 americium on New Years Day (and we were rushed to get to our breakfast reservation), but it was good to speak with him. My husband and I have stayed at many Airbnb's, and this is by far our favorite! The locations is within minutes of walking from fantastic restaurants.
We were headed to San Diego for the next part of our trip and needed a quick laundry fix. She was very responsive and helpful the entire time. We highly recommend staying at her topographic point and look forward to staying there again on our next visit.
The accommodations felt thoughtful. We loved the 15 minute walk to the pier so much we went twice during our overnight stay. Will definitely rebook if we are ever in Redondo Beach.
We did walk to Edwin Green grocery store—which was an easy distance though I would be cautious doing so after dark (as you would do anywhere in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) special concerns). It was lovely to begin the day with morning coffee in the darling courtyard space (espresso and/or coffee, tea, cream and misc. snacks provided—thanks, Ken).
The description of the listing is very accurate, it really did feel like a retreat. The space was so cute, she is very thoughtful and creative with the decoration and lots of attention to detail to make the space as comfortable as possible for guests. She actually uses the room as a guest room for friends and family normally so this isn't some Airbnb where they slap together all their old and mismatched furniture and sheets.
She stated that even though she knew it was a safe neighborhood, she wanted to make sure her guests felt safe at all times. Our commute to Seattle from the cottage was nice and smooth. After staying there for 6 nights I highly recommend this location.
Pictures are accurate, and if anything kind of undersell the place. Charming, and comfortable basement suite. Lots of thoughtful touches like fresh half and half for the coffee, fresh fruit, local ice cream and pastries...
They absolutely loved it. I had a great stay at Peg and Jeff’s place! Started with clear communication, flexible check-in, and a warm welcome.
We really enjoyed our stay at Jose's. We especially loved the bed and duvet which are super comfy and the bathroom is great. It takes about 45 mins to get into downtown but there are transport links close by and Jose is very helpful and offered to give us a few rides to the nearby metro station.
Would totally recommend. Brendas Location is a nice, clean and cosy little room in a lively area of san francisco. I was cordially received and hosted from her during the whole stay.
Elizabeth’s place is everything you want in a stay away from home. Would definitely recommend!
Peg and Jeff were very responsive and communicated with us on the day of our arrival and to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. The location was fabulous! We highly recommend staying at Peg and Jeff's place.
Truly nice spot. The location near Opera Alley is fantastic for exploring Tacoma. Great food & drinks & several theaters within 3 blocks in any direction.
The outside area is great for a glass of wine or cup of coffee and a few licks from Jesse makes it even better ! Perfect location!! We walked to town everyday, so close to everything you could need.
It is also a walkable distance from many amazing restaurants, which is very convenient. No concern about losing sleep from any outside noises! Additionally, my family brought our two dogs with us, and they were very cool about it.
Staying here was like being at home. I felt like I was at home. It’s like Elizabeth is saying “ Mi casa es su casa”.
angela's beach bungalow is THE perfect cozy stay for a couple or two friend and is one of the best airbnb's i've ever stayed in. walking into the space immediately put me at ease. candles were lit, everything was light, bright and clean.
This home is in a great location, a few blocks from the pier and a short Uber ride from LAX. Janet Luckman was a great detailed communicator, super flexible, and very kind. We enjoyed our stay!
Thought out. Cozy. Warm.
We were headed to San Diego for the next part of our trip and needed a quick laundry fix. I highly recommend staying with Laura! She is so lovely and hospitable, as was her precious dog Sassy.
She couldn’t be more friendly and polite! The location of their apt is perfect for easy access to and from Oakland Airport and great access to Oakland and San Francisco. The ferry stops in Alameda to take you to San Francisco, as well!
I would definitely come back to their residence again, and you will not be disappointed! My girlfriend and my experience at Star and Austin’s place was better than expected. Star and Austin were responsive and were accurate in their description.
Justin’s place is close to the one of the best restaurant in the world, as well as the “gourmet ghetto” of excellent and inexpensive food. I’d highly recommend Justin’s place!
Her home was always tidy and quiet. What you read is what you get... and more!! Laura made it feel like my own home.
Words can not express how nice Tammy and Marc were. The hosts are wonderful! Friendly, quick to respond.
A day walking along the beach path, or a really long bike ride,or an easy hour walk to the shopping mall..... the restaurants and grocery stores are so close and the comedy club right on the doorstep in walking distance ....the BEST place! The little touches like sticky tape, and scissors, even down to great clothes hangers that have material so your clothes stay on them! fantastic experience and such great hosts!
We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the bite Bob and Sharann left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen. I picked an absolute winner, you should too.
Go sit outside on the amazing patio and talk about how lame its going to be when you have to leave this place. The space is exactly as represented in the photos and description:   this is a very sleek, stylish, clean,  and  modern casita, with a great bed, bath,  and amenities. Particularly loved the wonderful light, windows and  design elements of the ceiling and interior.
Saved us money on Uber rides and were also just fun. Christine's place is a stylish and modern space, tastefully decorated and perfect for a quiet couples getaway. It is attached to her home but feels very secluded with separate, outside access around the side.
We had a antic stay and would definitely book Richard Batton's place again! Brent & Barry have the whole Air Bnb game down to a science! My husband and I stayed there for 3 nights and wanted for nothing.
Good location. Room is big and clean. Bathroom is right next to it.
It was easy to find as Tammy has a light up sign with the address. Tammy and Matthew An have truly thought of every detail to make it a comfortable stay. My husband and I had a great time!
Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! It was so far the best air bnb experience we had. The topographic point is comfortable and very clean.
It was so cleanly,  impeccably designed, welcoming, private, and warm-we lacked nothing and only 2 blocks from beach! The location is convenient to everything; an easy walk to Riviera Village in one direction and the pier in the other. To top it off, T is a great host.
This is really a hotel standard home but with much more idea put into every little detail, from the styling and color selections of the entire room to all the nicely designed and framed instructions and notes throughout. There is large TV, coffee machine, clean robes, slippers, and even a bottle of aspirin provided. We were surprised by the little instruction book that contains all house and neighborhood information we need to know, super detailed and graphically designed.
We loved everything about this (Website hidden by Airbnb) close to beach, beautiful, clean n fresh and just perfect. We actually hate leaving. Tiana is a super host for a reason she is 100% SUPER.
We stayed 2 weekends in a row. Thanks again Elizabeth.
Thank you Christiana, and thank you for checking in with me to make sure everything was alright, and asking if I had everything I needed. This is my second time staying at this lovely studio conveniently located in Old Town, just a short stroll to three awesome breakfast coffee places, and The Spar for dinner! The view of Commencement Bay from the studio, the comfortable bed , furnishings and HD television, the thoughtful snacks all create a lovely experience in this clean, efficient studio.
This space was such a great oasis in the midst of the Oakland. So close to our relatives place, this space is very chic with some thoughtful touches and a relaxed vibe. They have a mini fridge for your needs that they so generously filled with some fluid treats.
The beach house was very clean, comfortable, stylishly decorated and  a great location right by the beach. Highly recommend this home for your stay!
Very clean! Will definitely be staying here again in the future as we come to Oakland to visit friends often.
She has an eye for details and takes care of extra touches to insure that her guests are comfortable and pampered. The gourmet breakfasts are simply delicious, with organic tea served hot (the way I love it), fresh squeezed orange juice and wonderful dishes like steel cut oatmeal with baked apples or yummy egg scrambles with sides. The bed is very comfortable, with lovely, high end sheets to sink into.
You want to stay here!!! Linda & Mike’s place was so perfect for two couples. Although their place is only listed as a private room you have so much space and privacy that you’d feel like you have an entire place.
We loved how quiet it was and how close it was to the beach. Highly recommend!
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to enjoy some beach fun, and doesn’t mind a nice drive along the coast to the main highways. There’s also a good variety of local coffee shops, restaurants, and bars near the area that are pleasantly satisfying.
Chip's place is a great getaway! My wife and I wanted a place that felt far away, but didn't take hours and hours to get to. This fit the bill.
This place was so lovely! I’m a Cal alum visiting from the East Coast who wanted a space close to great food but a more quiet and restful area than those immediately next to campus. This topographic point was perfect!
Location can’t be beat, right smack dab in Chicago. I had to put an air diffuser away in bathroom cabinets because it was strong for my sensitive nose but other than that it was perfect. Living room area is lovely and comfy too!
That's all I needed to start the request for 10 stars on Airbnb. Even though I got in pretty late (flying from the east coast) their warm welcome was quite comforting after a long day of travel. The suite was very clean and had quite a few thoughtful touches.
This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud. This is the second time my family has stayed at Brian and Hillary's amazing space in Tacoma and we loved it! Such a creative, open, beautiful space with lots of fun amenities!
Quick response to any of our question . Would definitely stay there in the future.
We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental. We will book again with Marty’s place when we return to the Bay Area for a long weekend getaway in the future. Thankful that we had a wonderful & pleasant stay at Marty’s place.
Jeni was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area. The 2 bedrooms were nicely sized & the master had huge closets. It’s always nice to have linens & towels provided as well!
The views off of the deck were incredible. Next time we're down in the area, we'll definitely be checking availability here. Thank you!
The beds are very comfortable and the space was pretty quiet especially given such a central location. If we are ever again in Chicago, we would love to come back!
Chris and Tim's topographical point was awesome! It was so relaxing and quiet. A block from the beach, it can't get any better.
Shantell Preusser place was FANTASTIC. The topographic point was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillow , fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.
Additionally the neighborhood is also extremely close to an assortment of restaurants and other entertainment outside of just the beach. I would highly recommend Mona's space for anyone looking for a place to stay in VA beach!
Stepping into Tyler’s apartment was like walking into a luxurious hotel, but better. He really has thought of everything and has equipped the room and en-suite with all the necessities for guest . The highlights being the delightful coffee machine, locally-sourced soaps and the very comfortable bed.
This artists loft is a very special place! A fantastic spot to relax during your time in Tacoma. The hosts utilize the space as a working studio as well, so there are areas you musn't touch but this really isn't a problem given the comfy areas provided for their guests.
We absolutely loved this place! Everything was so clear as far as instructions and helpful tips. His place is so neat and very clean.
Elizabeth is an amazing hostess. She offers more than expected and she does a great job with directions, communication, and working to make your stay smooth and enjoyable. We will stay with her again!
All in all, a fantastic AirBnB experience! Elizabeth is a wonderful host and her place is setup wonderfully for guests. You’ll enjoy the freedom of coming and going with keyed entry and plenty of house liberties.
The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked. We had a parking spot in the driveway for the duration of our stay which was amazing . Star and Jodi Stallings did offer us bikes to use which was sweet, but we didn’t end up using them.
I am long legged so my only complaint was how close the toilet was to the wall when sitting down ;) the patio was amazing! Location was amazing and was very easy to access all of South Bay. Raquel Eastham (her pup) was so sweet.
We literally wouldn't change a thing: comfy bed, Roku TV with Netflix, lots of closet space, clean, plenty of sunlight, good WiFi, private entrance, parking and the beach practically in your backyard! He offered great recommendations in the area. There were also nice extra touches of beach towels, snacks, bikes, water, iPhone speaker and remote controled skylight blinds.
Amazing deal and great stay. The guest room is private on the bottom floor with a full bath connected to the inside of the room. The room is spotless with coffee, snacks, 2 beers (great after a long drive), bath robes, slippers, tooth brushes, soaps, and other toiletries.
We had a wonderful stay! =)
Wonderful place to stay! The space is adorable, homey and comfortable. Angela left snacks in the space, which was great as it was rainy when I was there and I opted to work and relax and just enjoy the air bnb!
We loved our stay at Dennis Steward's topographic point and would highly recommend this rental. Marty & David are great host. What we love about Marty’s topographic point is, you have your own privacy & they also respect your privacy.
So well equipped with everything you could ever need. Heated floors, a fireplace, fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. We felt right at home.
This home has everything you need during your stay in Tacoma. Linda has beautiful flowering plants outside and comfortable decor inside. We loved the natural light that flows through the house because of all the windows.
The pillows were as comfortable as any hotel I’ve stayed at, and the beds and sofa were great too. PLUS, Brian and Hillary were super responsive from check-in to check-out, and gave us great recommendations. They couldn’t have been better hosts.
The in-between level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. Tyler stays on the third floor of the house. Free parking on the street  and we were always able to find a spot.
Angela was a amazing host and super nice! She offered me eggs and toast so i can make breakfast over the the span of my visit if i needed. She offered tips and always checked up to make sure things were going good.
Tiana has a great team that takes care of the space, is nearby if you need assistance, and will provide everything you could ever need. It sleeps 4 well. The beds are comfortable.
I like to walk to cafes and shop , but this location isn’t for doing that. The views walking around the neighborhood were nice
Nathan is an incredibly gracious host. He provides what you need, and goes beyond other hosts. For example, the extra towels and linen are things I like to frequently change, and to my surprise he had plenty for me to utilize.
Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble.
We felt like we were guest of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. Thanks so much Mark and Jenny. Don and Pam
I had an early flight and only spent one night there (barely) and I wish I would have had more time there to enjoy the home and neighborhood. If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll definitely look into staying at Dan and Traci’s place and give myself more time to soak it in. Cozy Room 3 has everything - nice bathroom with shower, a Keurig coffee maker, a mini fridge, big fluffy soft towels, plenty of storage space, and a lock on the door.
This is one of the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. For me it's all about the vibe, the amenities, and the location. This place gets bonus point for the vibe.
Secondly, the bed is very comfortable. We are both side sleepers, if that helps at all. :)  While the space is definitely "cozy," there is adequate space for a couple.
Susan's Proctor Airbnb in Tacoma, Washington is absolutely wonderful. Everything was so nice---easy to locate, good parking, immaculately clean, great snacks and breakfast foods, beds were very comfortable with great bedding. Susan was very thorough --- no questions were left unanswered.
You must go steep stairs but that's all right . Sassy the small dog of her is sooo cute. Everything was really really nice her! We would come back to Laura.
The beds and pillows are super clean and comfortable at Maggie's place. We stayed at Maggie’s apartment for 4 days. Such a cozy home!
Lets just say that Heather was awesome! She then provided us a tour of her place. During the tour she pointed out helpful maps that were framed and also local restaurant menus for us to look at if we wanted to order out.
Funky artwork throughout, which we appreciated. Could Uber anywhere in the city for less than $10 if willing to share a ride (but not during haste hour). Highly recommend, as long as you are able to negotiate a long flight of stairs.
On top of that, the location is awesome - two blocks from the beautiful beach and the bike path and close to lots of restaurants. Pamela Drew is a very friendly and welcoming host who went out of his manner to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we need. We would definitely stay here again if we are back in LA!
We could not have been more pleased. The space was cozy and private, just two blocks from the beach. They let us borrow bikes, which we rode up and down the strand from Redondo to Manhattan beach.
Angele is really warm hearted. Parking is very easy here, you can park at her driveway so don’t worry about that. She also provides us with bicycles so we can took a bike trip along Redondo Beach and Manhattan beach.
I would highly recommend her place for short or long term stays. 5 stars, would stay again.
The guesthouse offered tons of privacy and Neva was really friendly and helpful if we had any questions. A huge plus for us was  that it was a such short drive to LAX.
Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city. In comparing the prices when looking at Chicago, this was by far the cheapest and despite it being a "shared" airbnb, it felt like a hotel (since we had an Ensuite) just a batch cheaper! Also about a 1 minute walk to Gino's which was my favorite of all the deep dish pizza that I tried in Chicago!
The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. We didn't get to meet Jesus in person but we met his son who graciously helped us with late-night check-in. Both were very kind and professional, we felt like we were in good hands :) hope to be back in the future!
Everything was clean and ready for us. The views off of the deck were incredible. Please note this is a legit tiny house, so would not recommend if there is more than one or two of you.
This is the perfect little Boutique house for your stay in Redondo Beach it is lake located close to very great amenities especially the ocean! We were able to walk to the beach in the morning and down to our favorite donut shop called Cher Alexander donuts amazing and a great eatery that I think on yelp is five star called eat at Joe’s which is right next to a wonderful coffee shop called the boy and the bear. We were able to Uber easily when we needed to.
This is a very cool, unique space. Its a chic oasis in the middle of a somewhat industrial part of town. The place is a large open loft, but they have furnished it so feels quite warm and welcoming - in a very hip sort of way.
She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. I actually work very close to Leslie’s home so I am familiar with the area. So I can vouch for the restaurants like anchalee, cafe trieste, etc as very cute and yummy places to eat!
Our favorite thing to do was to take the bikes out to roam about the city, stopping by cute local stores and listening to late night music jams. My husband and I are already planning our trip out to Virginia Beach following year and we hope to stay here again!
This was a quick weekend stop after I got engaged. My maid of honor accompanied me. Tim was very attentive to our needs and helped us with our bags.
I swear we didn’t want to leave. When we first got there, we found post-it notes all around the place with instructions that made it easy to settle in. We met up with Melissa for a bit who welcomed us and made us feel at home.
Elizabeth is a kind, friendly host. She was a responsive, caring host. I'd definitely stay with her again!
The cottage is a cozy environment with a completely stocked kitchen; comfortable furniture; quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance to food, entertainment AND beautiful walking trails and the beach is one road crossing away! The week my husband came to visit, Tim spent time showing him around and the level of hospitality and true caring by both Tim and Chris can NOT be beat. If you are looking for a romantic get-away or the perfect beach location for a break - I highly recommend the Ocean Park Cottage.
Justin's studio is a nicely decorated first-floor room next to his garage. It is painted a charming shade of blue,  has a lovely wood floor and is accentuated with white trim and window shades. It has everything we needed for our two-day stay and is located conveniently near Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto.
The price was great too! Very spacious and nicer than the average hotel in this price scope .
We arrived from the airport at 11 americium . Since we used uber for our trip we did not have a place for our luggage. Tiana was so nice to let us store our baggage  at her topographic point while we went to have lunch and explore the pier.
Quirky, unique apartment in the attic space of a gorgeous old house. We especially loved the epicurean marble shower tucked into a turret! The kitchen is well-stocked, and we had a wonderful weekend relaxing, watching TV, and thumbing through the travel books on the shelf.
The amenities are more than you could need or want, and the place is stylish, very functional, and super clean. We prefer this location to many other neighborhoods - Noe Valley, North Beach, Richmond, Marina, even Pacific Heights. It is great for biking and walk - not so hilly - very convenient transportation (N Judah line).
We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Mona's place again! Brent & Barry have the whole Air Bnb game down to a science! My husband and I stayed there for 3 nights and wanted for nothing.
The apartment was very spacious and tidy. There is a little kitchenette with a fridge, sink, and microwave. It was a nice surprise to see that the fridge was stocked with water, OJ, milk, and yogurt.
Two blow dryers, straight iron and a separate mirror just outside bathroom. Easy walk to glass museum/bridge. Alfred’s restaurant across the street was an easy option for breakfast.
You can also walk to Laurel shopping district for a bite to eat and other shopping needs. This was our first major stop after a long flight from Australia and we couldn’t have felt more at home! The accommodation is in a great location, close to shops and attractions and in a safe and secure part of Oakland.
Absolutely loved the place and her! Angela’s place is a little piece of paradise. She has thought of everything you could possibly need to make a getaway as comfortable as possible.
The studio was well thought out and planned. The bed was comfortable, room stylish, great lighting and open space with vaulted ceilings (which I’m a sucker for). The location is great with a short walk to Trader Joe’s, coffee shops and restaurants and a Farmer Market that we visited on Sunday.
Linda's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit eccentric, quiet, & "comfy". We decided to visit Tacoma from nearby Seattle and Brian and Hillary's loft was the perfect home base for exploring this up-and-coming city. The loft was very spacious, comfortable and surprisingly quiet for being so close to the ports and trains.
The first thing you’ll notice is that Chris and Teresa Knight want you to have the best time possible. They are quick to offer advice on where to go, what to see, and where to eat. The front garden is magical and the cottage is so nicely decorated and appointed.
We appreciated a prompt communication in cases we had questions. The place is perfectly located  - soap . 25 minutes Uber ride to Arnold Jackson.
Happy stay to you! Lina Kennedy  Lina Kennedy M (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) / B (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) E. (Email hidden by Airbnb)   (Hidden by Airbnb) : lina.kennedy (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) _AlexProf
Jimmy is a kind and accommodating host. He also has a sweet dog that is extremely well behaved and let me love on him several times. I was attending an event at the nearby Hotel Murano and this was in close adequate location to get there in 5 minutes driving.
If you happened to forget something before arriving, the house likely has a clean spare of what you need (toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc). The home is within walking distance to several excellent breweries, just note that there is quite an incline to the streets from the home down to the shops/museums/harbor. One thing to point out is that if you’re not used to road noise, the home is on a 4-lane 30mph road; thankfully, the host had already provided ear plugs for those that aren’t used to it.
It was wonderful and held us over until lunch. Dan and Traci are so friendly and nice and their hospitality is top notch. If you’re lucky enough to wake up to Traci doing her actual job and preparing food for her clients, the smell will make you want to eat everything up.
I loved my time at Neva's beach bungalow. Neva greeted me warmly with her super sweet doggie. I felt (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was easy and clear.
Neva also had thoughtful extras such as a basket of travel items in case guests forgot something - which I did so I appreciated the lotion. Thank you! There was also shampoo and conditioner in the shower as well as a coffee area and fridge.
It is about a fast 10-15 minute drive to LAX, but beware of internal airport congestion once inside the airport. I would definitely stay at Neva's again. It was ideal for me.
I don’t ever write the views but I was compelled to let you view review for Marcia’s place. Just stop right now. And book.
Robert Turpen’s home is just two blocks off the beach and an easy walk to the Redondo Pier area. She has such a beautiful home, and the room with the ensuite bathroom was about as big as my old apartment, with a gorgeous view. Being a single woman, I wanted some place safe and I found it at Robert Turpen's.
The apartment is lush and artsy; it’s got a real lived-in, make yourself at home feeling. The location was perfect for us, easy to walk to excellent coffee and eateries. Sheri Vowell was generous in his hospitality and you can tell that renovating spaces is a true passion!
This was our second stay at Lois Davis’s place. This apartment is the cleanest, most quiet topographic point that we have rented. Lois Davis is a helpful and responsive host.
The home was so bright and cheerful, and the kitchen had all the amenities and then some for those that are super inspired to cook for themselves. She has taken great care to offer many special touches to make the experience feel like you have arrived to a well cared for home, to offer all of your basic need and then some. The only thing that I would have enjoyed and  made it perfect would have been a bathtub!
The location is convenient to everything; an easy walk to Riviera Village in one direction and the pier in the other. We’ll be back as soon as our schedule allows.
Short walk to beach and restaurants. Elizabeth was a marvelous host and made us feel completely welcome.
I know that the  Quality  That I got can’t beat it in a hotel even a  Richard Batton. So you’re really a light in my stay and I would not able to this without you guy’s. Thanks again!!!!
I have now experienced first hand why Richard Batton and her incredible AirBNB home has over 200 five-star reveiws! INCREDIBLE. PERFECT.
T was amazing! The cottage is just as cute and bright as it looks online! Super comfy bed and couch.
Enjoyed our visit. No complaints at all. Good location.
This was a beautiful Airbnb that is just blocks from the beach. The location cannot be beat, and the decor was beautiful and well thought out. Paul was a great host with amazing recommendations for anyone unfamiliar with the area!
He showed me the flat and gave recommendations when I arrived. I spent relaxing mornings and evenings there, had lovely chats with Michael and his other guests, and enjoyed this unique oasis in the middle of buzzing Chicago. You can tell Michael enjoys hosting and having people around in his home.
We highly recommend James Walker’s place. James Walker and his family are simply amazing. We were met with incredible hospitality, a beautiful space, a super friendly porch, and a fantastic location.
Overall I enjoyed my stay and I’d definitely stay there again if I find myself out in SF as a single lady again in the near future. My first trip to San Francisco would not have been the same if I had stayed anywhere but Brenda’s. “Perfectly located” is not an understatement- her house is in the middle of the Joan Litwin and walking distance to fantastic nightlife and food.
A charming suite full of character. Learned that the property was built in 1913 including the in law suite. Now it’s a historical building.
Wonderful hosts, awesome location! Erik Dickson and Dennis were lovely hosts, and their cabin location is nothing short of amazing. We felt like we were in a cabin oasis, with the city laid out just beyond the gate.
Chris’s apartment was exactly as it appears in the pictures, It is beautiful and the perfect place to come home to after a big day exploring in the city. It is so close to many amazing restaurants and cafes. Make sure you use the resource folder provided and eat at the restaurants suggested.
Sadly we did not cross paths with Brent or Barry but their personal touches, including a thank you note and a list of instructions/restaurant suggestions, made it feel like they were already friends of ours! We will definitely recommend the space and return again in the future!
Also I have to acknowledge the communication prior arrival was really quick and clear. Maggie's place is in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. We enjoyed our ten minute walk to subway station, and found people watching in subway amusing.
Neva’s petite boutique is great! I am long legged so my only complaint was how close the toilet was to the wall when sitting down ;) the patio was amazing! It was an oasis in the middle of Redondo beach.
Arthur Paddick greeted us and I immediately felt at home. She gave us "the tour" right away and very thoroughly. Lovely adjustment for my adult daughter and myself (we need separate bedrooms!)
! Wonderful hosts and place. Our secret hideaway.
The location is great within walking distance to Redondo Beach and (albeit a longer walk) to the pier/entertainment area. Upon arrival, the place was clean and had a mix of drinks, coffee and other things to make us comfortable. Paul was very responsive and checked in to make certain our stay went great.
I can’t say enough good things here! The studio is clean, comfortable and has a spectacular view of Commencement Bay. Michael Krieg’s personal touches make it excess special, fresh flower , and snacks.
Paul's guesthouse is clean, quiet, safe, and in a great location. He even has a shampoo/conditioner/body wash console in the shower. TV has various networks to choose from.
The bedroom/bathroom were sparkling clean and had all the amenities you could ever imagine needing. The room is even cuter than the pictures, and the bed is super comfortable! As LGBTQ traveler , my partner and I felt very comfortable at Gregory Simons's place and enjoyed the neighborhood.
There are so many unique touches and amenities. They have books and games and artsy coloring books! We didn’t even get around to playing pool on the pool table.
You'll love it! The room was very spacious and clean. The decor was very beachy!
Neva was very communicative about the stay and friendly. As mentioned in the description it's a small space but a welcome respite at the end of a long day! The backyard is quite charming as well.
We really appreciated their flexibility with check-in and all the special touches that were included. We'll definitely stay here again whenever we're in Chicago. If this place is open, then book it.
Particularly loved the wonderful light, windows and  design elements of the ceiling and interior. Diane was prompt and clear in all communications, and very warm and helpful at check-in and check-out, and in sharing some excellent tips for restaurants, coffee shops and neighborhood activities. We enjoyed every element of our stay at Diane's place and hope to be back again soon!
Great hostess and cute bungalow. Quiet neighborhood and short walk to shopping, Redondo Pier and beach.
The neighborhood is transitional as described but the 5 days we were there we did not have any disturbance from the neighbors and nothing in the neighborhood caused us a problem or gave us concern. We hope to see Geneva and Brian again! !
Great location close to the beach and has many restaurants/fast food  within walking distance. Owners payed attention to every detail and were always a text away to provide any needs. They also provided a bike for every family member to use.
We were headed to San Diego for the next part of our trip and needed a quick laundry fix. Her home was always tidy and quiet. The description she provides of the home is very accurate.
Amazing getaway in the sunshine with so many happy plants! I loved this simple and serene space. We had a great experience; highlights include enjoying a cold beer in the sunshine at the picnic table and saving my outdoor showers for the afternoon when the sun was brightest.
This place is worth the money! The planes overhead were especially loud when we stayed (which didn't bother us because we were so exhausted from the beach), but Melissa was kind enough to ask if we had slept okay. If I can, I would DEFINITELY book this room again.
The love of my life and  sweetheart Was so happy to stay there. It’s perfectly located, minutes from the beach, and all the shops and restaurants. We enjoyed it so much we plan to book more stays starting following month.
Heather’s place was antic . It’s in a great location for exploring the city, yet getting away from the hassle and bustle in the evenings. Heather doesn’t leave you needing anything!
Convenient and delicious options so close to home. And you will feel at home there! The Pink Line is just a few blocks away and offers excellent access to the city so you can just park the car for your visit (plenty of street parking but be comfortable analogue -parking just in case needed).
Coming and going was very easy. The front door offered a key pad and there was also one on our bedroom door for added security. There is a shared kitchen and life room area.
There were plenty of blankets, excess towels, and pillows. When we first got there Luis Hawkins took us around the house to show us everything. It was pretty cold when we were there, but there was a heater in each room, perfect for night time.
It is located very close to adorable shops and restaurants. I loved the star jasmine in the entranceway, the fragrance is amazing. The house was so clean.
The great pride that they take in their unit is evident from the comfy bed, array of towels, and personalized welcome message in the room. They were also such gracious hosts--they gave us a lovely history of the area, had brochures from local restaurants, and even little mints on the bed side stand. Would highly recommend
:) If you are looking for a peaceful, quiet, beautiful place to stay (with hosts that care about your comfort, needs, & pocketbook), then look no further. James Walker place provides not only a reasonably priced stay, but in addition, a lovely patio, a place to store & heat food, a fireplace (my personal favorite!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and we only wish we could have stayed a few more days. We highly recommend Katherine's home for her thoughtfulness and responsiveness.
We had the best stay at Michael Krieg's beautiful studio! The studio had everything we needed and more! The views were amazing, and everything inside is new, clean and in great condition.
It’s always ridiculously clean and so comfortable, and Edward Ramsey and Tammy couldn’t be better hosts! You can walk, ride or drive to anything. Great amenities offered like all goodies you need for the beach - things you don’t or won’t pack.
Truly nice topographic point . The location near Opera Alley is fantastic for exploring Tacoma. Great food & drinks & several theaters within 3 blocks in any direction.
The hosts have also gone out of their way to provide local tourist information, some game and toys for children, and an assortment of DVDs. Terrific experience overall!
Beautiful decor, a nice bed, and plenty of other little touches made the cottage such an enjoyable topographic point to stay. We loved starting the day hanging out on the cute little porch swing, listening to the birds. The beach is just a short walk away through a beautiful quiet neighborhood.
A block from the beach, it can't get any better. Huge library of books to choose from with all sorts of genera. Fully stocked kitchen for cooking if you want to.
We enjoyed the Odd Otter brew pub and the donut place about five doors down. We could have had fresh brewed coffee with creamer in the home and taken advantage of the provided snacks, but we decided to wander in the morning. The bed was comfortable and there were lots of pillows.
I chose the place because of the reviews and the pictures. It was a wonderful experience! I was in Tacoma for my daughter's Lacrosse games.
Overall, this place felt like home and was very cozy. Our family of 6 greatly enjoyed our stay at Nina's place. If I could give it 10 stars I would.
We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway. An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey! !
They were very helpful with advice on transportation and food, and great for a general chat as well. It's an easy walk to the West Oakland BART station and the very next stop is in San Francisco. Great value, great location, great hosts, I highly recommend them!
The room is comfortable, and nicely decorated. There’s snacks, shampoo, lotions, and other nice touches. The bathroom was very clean, and the shower nice.
Easy walk to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. Once I asked Bennie Dudgeon about it the following night, she had helpful suggestion that resolved the problem.
We really loved our time here! Check in was fast and easy with clear instruction manual . It is as good as shown in the photograph , if not better.
This house is very quiet and the streets are clean and have a peaceful feeling to them. Everything was clean, and the welcoming fruit and milk was appreciated. We would stay here again and will suggest this place to anyone!
It was easy to find as Tammy has a light up sign with the address. Tammy and Marc have truly thought of every detail to make it a comfortable stay. My husband and I had a great time!
They even checked in with me throughout my stay to see if there was anything I needed, or if they could pick up anything at Whole Foods for me while they were out. Lots of pillows in varying levels of firmness...just the best sleep experience possible. (They even provided ear plugs, as there is a train nearby that tended to wake me up early.)
We loved our time in Dennis Steward and Attina's tiny house. Everything was clean and ready for us. Any time I reached out, they responded immediately.
The rooms are super cunning . The location is close enough to walk to the BART quickly. Everything was spotless and they have little labels on things so you know where to find anything you need.
Neva’s place was private, clean,  and well located between Redondo and Hermosa Beach. I was really taken by her contemplation to guest (Website hidden by Airbnb) awesome. I would definitely stay there again.
The bungalow was nicely decorated and stocked with supplies for continental breakfast. I would stay there again & would strongly recommend this rental to friends traveling to So Cal beaches.
What a lovely experience at George and Colleen's place! It was truly an oasis and exactly what we had searched for - a local getaway that made us feel like we were in the middle of nowhere without having to drive for hours out of Oakland.
First time Airbnb'er here..  Neva's place was exactly what i was looking for.. Would stay here again next time I visit LA!
It is a great place to stay, close to public transit and it was really close to nearby shopping malls. It is a bit away from the city (30min-1hr) min ride via bus and subway, which means it is really quiet! The place was very clean and stylish.
! What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favorite area within Chicago.
Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. There’s a plant with a vine along an upper wood beam that just creates a beautiful environment. Our stay was very comfortable, and relaxing.
We barely couldn’t get out of bed. This is the best best best birthday surprise for my best friend and she love it! So is Marilee, a dog was too chilling!
I felt very cosy and safe in the beach style, clean and well presented AirBnb. Amazingly comfortable bed!!!! The beach is an easy walk and I would certainly book again.
I really loved it here. We were in town for a wedding in Olalla, and chose to stay in the cute town of Gig Harbor. Debra Dibble was incredibly sweet, the house is cunning , and breakfast was amazing!
The room is at the back of the house and it stands alone in the garden. We sometimes met Mishaa in the morning and her warm greetings always made my day! The bathroom is a bit distant but it's clean and well equipped with Mishaa's hand made basin, cups and plate which are beautiful!
Marc and Dorothy Moser are very friendly and excellent hosts. A couple things to note are that it is nice they provide bicycle ,  just know that they are older. They are fine for just a short ride down the beach but if you want to go any farther I would suggest renting some bikes.
There’s big trees and it’s very tranquil. The room is comfortable, and nicely decorated. The bed is comfortable, and you won’t want to get up.
This air bnb was great. The space was super cute and also had everything you needed for an drawn-out stay. It was located a couple blocks from the boardwalk, which was totally walkable and very conveniently located to grocery stores, shops and places to dine by bike ride, short Uber ride or walking.
It’s extremely modern, the bathroom is flawless, and the bed/pillows are wonderful. There are plenty of take-out places in the area in case you spend your day out and about and decide to share a meal in for an evening or breakfast - again perfect (plus there is a balcony  to enjoy tea and coffee outside). It is roughly a 10-15 minute or less Uber ride to anywhere in the city.
Paul and Karen were very nice and was available if we needed anything. Thank you and we recommend this Airbnb to all.
Other notes, idk how to set up the wii but it’s okay because I enjoyed tv instead. Zeena and her husband, Howie, have a beautiful home and were very gracious hosts. My wife and I actually had just gotten married and were coming in fairly late from our reception.
City noises- trains, cars, people- but that is fully stated and there are ear plugs left for guests for that reason. So I expected it. Communication was EXCELLENT!
Deanna's place is really special. The cottage is just lovely, the kind of place you want to wrap up at the end of the holiday and take back home with you! Deanna and David were friendly, approachable and the perfect hosts.
There are so many alone touches and amenities. We enjoyed listening to the albums on their turntable, and we used their projector to watch some YouTube videos. We hung out at their beautifully lit bar.
Super cozy and comfortable bed, the space heater quickly took care of the chilly nights, lots of small touches like tea and snacks. Louise is also very accommodating. I needed a iron and hair dryer and they were provided for me.
Raquel Eastham was a great host with a lot of knowledge and unique insight to his city and recommendations during our short stay. The room was delightfully comfortable we almost missed walking around the city! :) I would not hesitate staying here again especially to see the outdoor patio all planted.
We were able to check in early which made our few days in LA even better. I would definately recommend.
A cozy, clean and comfortable spot in the historic North End! Quick drive to sixth Ave, Point Defiance, Proctor and Stadium districts, UPS, downtown etc. Added bonus: within walking distance to the legendary Frisko Freeze!
Alfred’s restaurant across the street was an easy option for breakfast. A small noisy during am week days but didn’t really bother us and we used the projector to watch Lori Stewart. Will definitely stay here again.
We loved our cozy room, the art and decor was so unique, the location was perfect, and the rooftop patio was a great bonus. It’s probably even better in the warm calendar month , as we saw Michael’s seed collection laid out for spring planting, but we still enjoyed it! Michael even gave us his wool blanket for the baseball game we attended— very thoughtful and kind.
Staying at Jose’s was brilliant . I would definitely recommend his place to family, friends & anyone else looking to visit the city. It’s within perfect distance of downtown and major attraction areas but also far enough away to where it is quiet & relaxing.
We are hoping to visit again soon and try out another one of their locations! Erik Dickson’s topographical point was awesome! My wife and I came here for a long weekend and really enjoyed ourselves.
We could use a pack and play for our baby and we could have even used bikes. Tammy and Joseph Lewis are fantastic hosts. Always very thoughtful with their guest , we had everything we might need, beach towels, bikes, disposable plates, coffee, beach chairs, scissors, you name it.
Had a really nice, too quick, one night stay. Gregory Simons was very communicative about the stay and friendly. The space was very clean and cozy.
Everything was found just as described. The house itself is beautiful and welcoming. You will feel very comfortable and relaxed after your sleep in a heaven bed.
Paul was an awesome host, very easy to get a hold of and very accommodating. It felt like we knew him. We would definitely stay there again and we absolutely recommend it.
I stayed at Tyler's place for a night and it felt like I was at a hotel. I slept like a baby! I also really enjoyed how eco-friendly everything was; from the spa local products being kept in glass bottle instead of plastic in the restroom to the ability to dim the light and conserve energy.
Very comfy bed, great shower and close to the beach areas. Neva has such a wonderful space to stay when visiting the area! Close to everything needed!
He has thought through every single detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robes - he has anticipated his guests' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special. !
Bed was so comfy, I slept great! This is a such a quaint little spot nestled in an area that has so much to offer via walking distance and within a short drive. Although near a big street, it was very quiet and the bed was SUPER comfortable.
Tyler and his partner were both very hospitable, even invited us to have a glass of champagne when Tyler’s family came over to visit. You definitely don’t get that experience in a hotel! We have no negatives about this place, it really is a unique experience - we have stayed in some pretty unique Jodi Stallings before, this one tops them all.
Great resto recommendation! This space is a perfect small place right near the beach. We could walk easily there and it was in walking distance to the pier where there are lots of yummy food options.
We were so happy when we arrived. We briefly met Neva when arriving, she is friendly and nice. Her dog Logan is a very cute, friendly and well behaved dog!
Staying at Jose’s was magnificent. The vicinity itself is very family oriented and I loved having his driveway to park in, made life a lot easier! We will definitely be back!
A great place to stay in the Los Angeles area. Pamela Drew is very hospitable and welcoming. Parking is easy and the drive to cardinal area of LA are about 30 minutes.
Very stylish, tidy, and roomy. I really loved the location. A two minute walk to the end of the block connects you to blocks and blocks of restaurants, bars, entertainment, and stores.
Had a really nice, too quick, one night stay. Neva was very communicative about the stay and friendly. The space was very clean and cozy.
The space was so cute, she is very thoughtful and creative with the decorations and lots of attention to detail to make the space as comfortable as possible for guests. Loved the garden. Fresh duck eggs from the backyard duck were amazing and so nice and generous of her to share!
Nala is also helpful and communicates with you in you in progress of your trip so all is well. Nala is a great host; I would love to stay here again!
Ewa is a warm and courteous host, and her apartment is a lovely private space in the back of a cool art gallery. The apartment is thoughtfully stocked with all the essentials for a short stay (comfy bed, extra blankets, TV, toiletries, coffee/tea, plates and cutlery), and Ewa was responsive and easy to communicate with. The location is conveniently close to the blue line and a short Uber ride to some of the best parts of the city.
Our time at Zeena's was an experience that we weren't expecting, but are so blessed to have had. Zeena is one of the sweetest human beings I have ever met. It is very apparent that it is important to her that her guests feel welcome, cared for, and truly at "home away from home".
I wish I could give more than five stars. I adore Proctor Cottage. I discovered it last spring when I came up for my daughter's Sheri Vowell games.
Angela was extremely friendly and welcoming. The backyard space was very zen and gorgeous and made us feel very comfortable and at home. The beach cruisers were also super fun and we were very thankful we got to use them.
They had banana bread sitting on the counter when we arrived (which may have been the best banana bread I've ever had in my life). They also have the coolest book where you can take a photograph of yourself and write about your travels - so it was really neat to look through it and see all of the people who had stayed with them before us. Their property is located super close (like, 2 miles) to a great downtown-ish area with a theater, restaurants, and an awesome bookstore.
Nathan is an incredibly gracious host. Wrigley field is minutes away, along with amazing restaurants and coffee shop !
Apartment is beautifully decorated and such a beautiful patio. We walked down there two morning for breakfast. Would definitely stay here again if I’m in the area.
We used them not only to get to the beach, but to get all around town. The room itself is very clean and comfortable and provides all the things you'd need to get out to the beach for the day or to enjoy a relaxing morning or evening on the couch. We also appreciated the provided coffee and to-go cups and the fridge/freezer combo.
Giant room finished with fantastic materials. This room is probably the best place we have stayed in an Airbnb so far! Big room with a king bed, master bath.
Zeena is the hostess with the mostest! I have dietary allergies, and Zeena made sure to tailor breakfast with my allergies in mind - she is a very kind person and a generous hostess. Zeena is very knowledgeable about  local activities and has great suggestions if you want to do some site seeing.
Puts the "bed and breakfast" into AirBNB. Other AirBNB places I've rented are more like alternate motel lodging, but this is what I imagine what a traditional bed and breakfast must be like. Not only do you get a cozy, comfortable room to stay in, you receive a private tea party at breakfast, and friendly company -- it's more like staying with a long lost aunt than staying at a hotel.
It feels better than most hotels. Great location, great amenities, clean, great accomadations and recommendations! Scott provides all the information you need to have a great stay in Redondo Beach!
The room is at the back of the house and it stands alone in the garden. We sometimes met Matthew An in the morning and her warm greetings always made my day! The bathroom is a spot distant but it's clean and well equipped with Matthew An's hand made basin, cups and plate which are beautiful!
Tyler spoke to April and I to see what our interests were in food and entertainment then proceeded to make suggestions for food in the Mission District, as well as other places around San Francisco. Tyler’s room was about a 20 minute flat walk to the twenty-fourth street mission BART station which was very convenient. The touches both in the room and around the condo were warm and inviting and I know that I made the right decision to stay in Tyler’s AirBnB!
We loved everything about this (Website hidden by Airbnb) close to beach, beautiful, clean n fresh and just perfect. Thank you :)
And they have coasters! I sent some of my friend’s the link and they loooooved it! So many compliments on the place!
We absolutely loved our stay at Sierra's little cozy apartment. (I was in town for a surgery) We ended up needing to come a couple days early and Sierra was able to accommodate us and was so attentive to our needs. Check in was seamless, street parking was easy to find right in front of the place which is great for the Bay Area.
The space was cozy and private, just two blocks from the beach. The bathroom and bedroom space were extremely clean and had everything we could have needed (anything from coffee, extra beach towels, sunblock, bottle opener, etc.). I couldn’t have asked for a better experience!
Little things like the coffee and bikes really made you feel at home. Very close to local businesses and the beach. The decor is very cute and the small details really made it.
The place was so clean and Paul has an amazing local guide! Paul’s place was perfect for our stay. Perfect location, just a couple blocks to the beach.
Ceiling fans helped cool things down in the evening and helped to make a good nights sleep. The neighborhood is transitional as described but the 5 days we were there we did not have any disturbance from the neighbors and nothing in the neighborhood caused us a problem or gave us concern. Great location to get to downtown Seattle or Tacoma and not a bad drive to Rainier or Olympic National Parks.
Used the bikes and grillroom . The host even did our laundry which was an amazing plus. Highly recommend.
We were here on a very hot week! Couldn’t tell that from inside the house, central air kept us nice and cool. Outside was barbarous !
We loved our stay at Neva's! Nevas place was beautiful and clean. One of the comfiest beds I’ve ever slept in and the location was perfect.
It really is spotless. - Chloe
She is very friendly with a warm personality and responsive to any questions we may have had. It was extremely clean and comfortable. She had recently purchased a new Casper mattress.
Thankful that we had a wonderful & pleasant stay at Marty’s place. She has done a fantastic job making sure no detail is forgotten. Marty took the time to print maps and schedules to help us figure out how to take a quick (cheap) ferry ride over into San Francisco.
The minor issues we had were quickly solved with a quick text. Robert Turpen goes above and beyond to make certain your needs are accommodated and you feel at home. The bedroom/bathroom were sparkling clean and had all the amenities you could ever imagine needing.
The hosts were very understanding when I needed to drop off my suitcases an hour before check-in. Maggie's place is on the northern edge of Forest Hills and the walk to the subway is only 7 minutes. We were able to easily get to our destinations in Queens and Manhattan.
I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a fantastic respite from urban Berkeley. Sequoiah provided some excellent cow's milk that went great with my coffee. In all, I loved staying here and would certainly do so again if the opportunity arose.
Relatively quiet area given proximity to major Oakland-Berkeley streets and Rockridge BART station. Not recommended for those with mobility issues or people really craving  their “elbow room.”
When we were there, the temp outside was like 31 degrees. Dorothy Moser was also super fast in responding to inquiries through the Airbnb chat. Answered questions during our stay within minutes.
Dennis Steward didn’t miss a detail. Thank you Dennis Steward ! !
:D Perfect stay! The room is lovely with any possible amenities included, local guides, plays for children.
Staying at Luis Hawkins’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. I am so glad I found Luis Hawkins’s home! !
Jeff & Mike are excellent hosts. They were great at getting back to us when we had questions. The room was excellent - very modern style, super comfy bed, sparkling clean bathroom, and a super cool fan to help regulate temperature in the room.
Christina’s place is a magical haven in the city. The room itself is so spacious and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. It’s supremely quiet there.
Safe parking in her driveway. Everything was found just as described. Loved the close location to the Redondo Beach.
You will enjoy the ambiance of the candles and lights. My wife and I have stayed in a few Airbnb’s and this was by far the best. Enjoy!
It is exactly as she describe the place. If you want to go to the beach you have to walk about ten minutes. Not close to Hermosa beach (you need to go there by car).
Matthew An was a fantastic host. We only saw her once or twice the whole weekend and it very much felt like we had the place to ourselves. Would definitely stay here again!
Thanks guy ! !
He helped us to move our luggage into the room when it was ready. Plenty of sheets and pillows. There was a desk area as well, the lights were for able to dim at certain levels for ambience lighting and the washroom lights were automatic sensors.
It’s extremely charming and has a lot of nice small tasteful touch . She made for a great stay. The location is outstanding and very safe.
From the very start Bob and Sharann were warm and welcoming. They even checked in before going out of town for a couple days to see if we needed anything before they left. The accommodation was so much nicer than we expected!
Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! Very quite and safe neighborhood. I highly recommend her place to anyone.
Also Gregory Simons is nice and accommodating! Clean, large, wonderful room with private bath (shower was marvelous!) Short walk to beach and restaurant .
Communication from the beginning was outstanding, every single question I had was answered promptly and with additional helpful information. In good traffic we could get to our son's place in SF in 25 minutes. Double that in heavy traffic, but we did not mind because we loved this casita so much!
The washer/dryer hook up is handy for cleaning your clothes. It's a little small to save space, but you could still fit about a week's worth of laundry in there if you want to clean your clothes during your stay or before you leave. And Joelle makes sure that she keeps everything stocked that you might need: blankets (even an extra one), sheets, toilet paper, soap, other toiletries, eating/cooking utensils, etc.
Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. It was fun to stay here. It was absolutely comfortable, clean, private, and gorgeous.
I would highly recommend her topographic point for short or long term stays. Lovely small patio with great airflow. Can't think of a single complaint.
AWSOME HOSPITALITY... and so much more! If the dates are available, BOOK IT!
I loved the star jasmine in the entrance , the aroma is amazing. He also allowed us to relax in the courtyard which is gorgeous. Jodi Stallings was so nice, we felt like we knew him for years.
It was spacious and we never felt crowded. It was a asset to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again
You can also walk to Laurel shopping district for a bite to eat and other shopping needs. The accommodation is fantastic for families (we hav (Website hidden by Airbnb) year old). The whole bottom floor of Laura and Ralph’s house and their large garden was ample space for us, and was private.
We enjoyed our stay at Rod's place! We did not meet Rod, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in directions were clear. Very happy with this experience!
Water was always hot. Automatic lights and Nest heat made me feel spoiled. And there were ample towels, toiletries, and plateware to be found.
It was tucked away in a residential neighborhood, but easy to transition back to the interstate. The kitchen and living room more charming, and the beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast in the cozy kitchen, and would’ve been happy to stay for more days if our travel plans had allowed.
I recommend staying here if you’re visiting the LA area. The room was very clean and Elizabeth us feel very welcomed.
Best for solo travelers or at most two people who travel light. Very straightforward check in process.
Her kitchen is well equipt to meet anyone's needs. Notes about the bedroom -  1) The bed and pillows are super comfy! We slept wonderfully.
The apartment is comfortable and quaint. We used the hot tub, which was very relaxing. I would highly recommend staying at Nina's Joseph Lewis, you will not be disappointed.
Awesome location! Neva was so sweet! She sat out back and talked for a bit with my girl friend and I as we enjoyed the peaceful patio and some drinks.
The parking is at the back and there is a narrow pathway next to the house where you can walk from  the parking lot to the front door. We love the kitchen and dinning area where we cooked breakfast and heated up leftovers. The only thing is the air condition was quite loud.
Sheri Vowell place is very nice and cozy. We could access the room simply. I have to mention the good quality of the bed;)!
Thanks for a great stay :) Perfect place for a solo traveler , or even a couple. Very comfy bed, great shower and close to the beach areas.
I had never done this before, and was a little concerned that it might be awkward. Turns out it was not awkward in the least! Shantell Preusser is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive.
Wonderful place to stay! Location is perfect, can walk to a lot fo restaurant and to pier/beach. Highly recommend!
Christiana’s personal touches make it extra special, fresh flowers, and snacks. I sleep better there than I do at home. That being said, the bed is super comfortable.
The love of my life and  sweetheart Was so happy to stay there. I haven’t been on a motorcycle in so many years. It was a vocational experience that her and I truly treasured.
The room is lovely with any possible amenities included, local guides, plays for children. The best airbnb house ever had. We feel like in our home, warmly recommended.
Overall a great airbnb, as described, and would stay there again! Awesome covered sitting outside. Without an oven, cooktop, or even a toaster oven, I don’t recommend staying longer than a day otherwise you have to try to find somewhere to eat every meal.
Danielle’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars.
Some reviews have mentioned footsteps upstairs. It was very quiet, in a quiet and gorgeous neighborhood. If this is available when you’re in town, and close to where you want to stay, book it before someone else does.
Stayed at this place to surprise my boyfriend for our anniversary and he was blown away by how gorgeous and spacious the loft was! The subject and decor are very stylish and Gloria keeps everything clean and tidy, and the house rules are straight to the point. The loft is located in a great topographic point because events, activities, and restaurants in Tacoma are a short walk or short drive/Lyft away.
This IS the Airbnb ultimate experience! We were thrilled with the cottage! It was impeccably furnished and inviting, as well as having every agreeableness you could need- thank you!
It was very comfortable, relaxing and VERY clean!!! The pool and hot tub were incredible and so relaxing and the dog were very sweet. Our child loved when they come over to visit.
Same was true for the day of my check-out - Christopher Brown kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. If it's available during your stay, book it.
Maggie responded quickly to all of my concerns. The bed is extremely comfy. We really enjoyed our time in the apartment.
We chose it for the proximity to our daughter and son-in-law, but we would choose it even if we did not have family in the neighborhood. The outdoor shower is amazing, and I love the there is no TV there: it's a nice respite. There is wifi if needed, but honestly, we just enjoyed our morning coffee and heading out into the city.
But Airbnb is still asking me to write a review and so I’m going to review based on my communication with Marcos Blount even though I didn’t get to actually stay. Marcos Blount was very responsive to messages and was very understanding that I had an emergency and couldn’t make it to Tacoma as the road conditions were very icy and dangerous and the event I planned to go to at the T-Dome had been cancelled due to weather. I really appreciate her understanding and will definitely try to book her place if I ever need to stay in Tacoma again.
She provided us with breakfast (yogurt and granola), tea, coffee and fruit ! Throughout our stay, she was always there to respond to any questions or concern we had. She was always very sweet and kind to us.
In the morning, I went downstairs for coffee, and we ended up having a great conversation for quite awhile! I went for a nice walk in the evening, through Wright Park and beyond. It's in a great location--on a very quiet street, but close to downtown.
Neva went above and beyond providing amenities, the bungalow was extremely comfortable and clean, and I would absolutely stay again! The place was super cute with a lovely outdoor setting! Neva is super sweet and has great energy!
She was such a great host starting from check in, she checked in on us mid way through our trip and when we checked out. She had some food, snacks, drinks and coffee for us to use throughout our stay which was so nice. She had great local recommendations which we used throughout our stay.
Walking on the beach in the morning and watching surfers out on the water was a real treat!! We were on the fence about staying this far from downtown San Francisco, but we're so glad we did. Transportation into the heart of the city is just a short train ride away, and even if you stick around the area, there is so much to explore.
I like the way that our space was separate from the hosts' space, yet they were totally available. You want to stay here!!! Great parking as well!
The bikes provided us with one of our favorite days in LA and it was these thoughtful amenities that made it one of the best Airbnb stays I’ve ever had!!! Hope to be back soon!
I was flabbergasted at the size and  how extremely beautifull her decore was. The stay was luxurious, and the price was unbelievably cost effective. Do not miss the opportunity to stay with her if she has the vacancy.
There were all possible cosmetic skin  and hair caring products in the bathroom. The beds were comfortable. The whole place is a bright designer solution of usage space in a most  effective manner.
Elizabeth Jones is a very warm and responsive host and added little touch to make us feel welcomed and at home. She has created a cozy place perfect for a couple’s retreat.
Def will keep this one on our list to revisit! Excellent communication! Place is as seen in pictures (if not better) and very comfortable.
The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon. I recommend staying here unconditionally!
Kelly's place is probably the nicest Airbnb in San Francisco for 2 people. As soon as you walk in, you'll see how spacious the room is and how tall the ceilings are. Everything is spotless and stylish.
It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.
The walk in closet was awesome. The shower was gorgeous. Elizabeth was very hospitable and friendly.
This is an AMAZING Airbnb. Lovely host World Health Organization was very communicative, both with specific instructions on check- inch as well as helpful tips on what to do in the area. They also had great beach cruisers that they lend to guests, and we had a great time exploring the area and beaches with the bikes.
Bathroom is right next to it. With al the goodies. Also recommendations are printed out for you.
Neva’s place was conveniently located for a week of traveling around the LA area. The guest house was a perfect size for two people to stay comfortably and her backyard area was great for hanging out and having a glass of wine or playing with her adorable puppy, Logan. Neva was an awesome host, always available and eager to make sure we had everything we needed for a great stay.
Elizabeth is a kind, friendly host. The king-size bed is soft but I found it comfortable and slept well. The room is bright and well-lit and is bright in the morning as well, also very quiet.
• The kitchen (and the fridge in particular) were sparkling clean. • There is a little office with many kinds of connection for phones and computer • The living room couch is really comfortable, and there’s a lap blanket for cuddling up. • The bathroom was outfitted with much more than we needed.
The bungalow was nicely decorated and stocked with supplies for continental breakfast. I would stay there again & would strongly recommend this rental to friend traveling to So Cal beaches.
Angela had ready for us a cheese plate, some sparkling wine, and chocolates! She also rented a pair of nice bikes to us for free! The cabin is small, but Angela has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay.
This space is even bigger in person than I expected from the photos! I cannot day enough great things about this little house. The next time I’m visiting LA, I’ll be looking to see if Paul’s place is available.
Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. The views from our window and the upstairs balcony were eye-popping and all of the accommodations and spaces were out of an interior design magazine! The bar areas and aquarium in the homeowner’s shared space were also quite impressive.
She has thought of everything you could possibly need to make a getaway as comfortable as possible. All of the little extras touches made us feel so welcomed. From the eggs and bagels in the fridge to all of the other snacks and beverages, she makes you feel like your staying at a family members home.
The room is very spacious. Since I was relocating I had more stuff than just traveling. They were gracious enough to let me check in early since I was coming from overseas.
The mattress is very comfortable , very firm (slept well even though I usually prefer a softer mattress) as is the rest of the room. Easy check in/out. Even a bidet toilet seat in the bathroom that I wasn't quite adventurous enough to try ha ha.
The space was cozy and clean and Chip (and his sweet dog Olive) thought of everything! We found the inclusion of some fun games and activities to be very charming as well. We'd love to return to spend more time here!
Also Elizabeth is nice and accommodating! Clean, large, wonderful room with private bath (shower was marvelous!) Short walk to beach and restaurants.
We highly recommend this AirBnB! The location of the house is very safe, even at night. You can either walk to the famous spots or take the bus, which stops near the house.
He has thought through every single detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robes - he has anticipated his guests' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special. Tyler has also provided explanatory notes for everything, making it very easy for guests to immediately feel comfortable upon arrival. However, if any question or request does come up - he was available 24/7 to chat with directly.
The house catered to a relaxing and freeing weekend. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and will for sure be back to see Chip and Oliver (his dog) again.
I'm still full from all the wonderful restaurants he recommended. My stay was magnificent and I couldn't have ask for more than provided.
Each bathroom was large with large, fluffy towels, shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash. The skylight over the king bed in the master bedroom provided a view of the night sky. I even saw two shooting stars at 4am the morning of our departure!
Perfect for 2 people. we hopped on the bikes every day and loved the location. The place was so adorable!
There is also a lovely barroom on the corner which had live music and poetry reading while I was there. All in all, a wonderful stay - I look forward to staying again the next time I'm in Berkeley.
Maggie’s place was the best Airbnb apartment I’ve ever been to. The apartment is about 10 minutes walk away to the next subway station and you need about 40 minutes to the Times Square with the subway. Maggie and her husband were always there when we needed something and even came downstairs to help us.
I would definitely consider staying here again! Tammy and Marc are wonderful hosts.
The Pink Line is just a few blocks away and offers excellent access to the city so you can just park the car for your visit (plenty of street parking but be comfortable parallel-parking just in case needed). The beautiful, modern guest house is thoughtfully set up for guests with everything including light switches labeled...instructions next to all appliances...plenty of cooking supplies and (Website hidden by Airbnb) conditioning...toiletries and comfy towels...plus plenty of visitor info and personal travel recommendations from the host. We appreciated the CTA cards left by other guests and left value on a few for the next guests as well.
FABULOUS. It has absolutely the best accommodation for sleeping plus one besides yourself. The shower has an amazing removable head with excellent water pressure and ridiculous hot water flow as desired.
The outdoor shower is amazing, and I love the there is no TV there: it's a nice respite. The location is perfect for enjoying many of Oakland's premier areas. Do not hesitate to book this place for it's location, restful sleep, fantastic shower, and getting to know Edward Ramsey and Amy!
Huge library of books to choose from with all sorts of genera. I would love to buy this place it's so stinking cute! Also, they provided all linens so that was really nice that we didn't have to bring that like previous beach airbnbs we've stayed in.
My family had an amazing beach week at The Carriage House! Miranda Malone was a caring host, attentive and super responsive to anything we needed. The house had a pretty, coastal vibe throughout -- we enjoyed all of the decor.
Strongly recommend. Star and Austin's home was clean and comfortable - I felt at home as soon as we walked in the door! They had shampoo, conditioner, soap , towels, even bikes and beach chairs!
We would highly recommend staying here and definitely wouldn't hesitant to stay here again! There is ample space for hanging out, sleeping and cooking and every space is spotlessly clean. The outdoor terrace is perfect for a morning coffee or breakfast and the pool right next to it is the place to be in the afternoons.
And another asset , Heather's house is directly behind the cottage. Then interior of the cottage is spotlessly clean, and more than adequately supplied with all the amenities that you would need for your stay there. I would highly recommend the Private Cozy Cottage for your next stay in the area.
I stayed in the vintage time capsule for 3 months with no issues. Deborah Hines is close by with plenty of cute restaurants. Lake Merritt (a 3 mile lake where plenty of people walk and ride bikes) and the Grand Theater (beautiful historic movie theater) are a couple exits away on the 580.
The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. I cannot rave about this place enough. So cozy.
Tyler’s room was about a 20 minute flat walk to the 24th street mission BART station which was very convenient. We just had a two night stay at Tyler’s place and it was our favourite Airbnb experience to date. It offers all the benefits of being in a hotel but is so much more personal and, the most important thing, you get great insider tips on where to go during your stay.
We had fantastic experience staying in Dorothy Moser home. It's located only two blocks away from the beach! I was glad that there were bikes, beach towels, beach chairs, and even boogie boards available to use.
One great thing about this area is the motorcycle path on the beach that goes all the way to Santa Monica. Also the owner lives upstairs and has cats. If you are a light sleeper you can hear them walking around early in the morning.
Susan called me day of to see if I wanted an early check-in and also to confirm my muffin choice. The communication and welcoming environment is just wonderful. I will always be checking here first for availability when I am back in the area.
It's located on a beautiful street within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and coffee. I had an absolutely perfect stay and walked everywhere. Spring has already come to Berkeley with multiple trees and flowers blooming and the scent in the air is pure poetry.
PERFECT place to say in SF. Super clean. Entry is easy with coded lock - location is excellent, close to Dolores Park, BiRite market and Pizzeria Delfina and so many other great walkable places between the Mission and Castro.
Jo made every accommodation we had asked for and then some. Jo showed us all the best spots including running along the waterfront and through beautiful and safe areas of the city. She gave us all the good tips of the local bar, Vietnamese restaurant and coffee shops.
I traveled with my mom and my kids and we were comfortable, delighted, and fell in love with the area. Walking to the many parks nearby, and to Taylor St for dinner and dessert - we even found a bit of our personal family history as 3 generations ago our family lived in the same area. Roberta Hallenbeck was a fantastic communicator and the small touches throughout the Coach House made our stay so easy and seamless.
Better than the first. From making the keys available to us (she was out of town) and then having a family member check on us to make sure all was well, everything was first class. The cottage was very clean, all amenities were available and useable, and the serenity was very appreciated.
The apartment is comfortable and quaint. It was nice waking up in the morning and having a cup coffee on the deck. The kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea, coffee pot and Keurig, filters, sugar, cereal and juice.
One of our favorite AirBnB locations ever! Hip, comfortable and in a great location. Heather and JP have thought of everything you will need to enjoy your stay.
He valued privacy, but was on hand for conversation too. I definitely would stay again!
Igor and May are such wonderful host ! I will be returning to stay here in the future and I highly recommend this place!
Even a bidet toilet seat in the bathroom that I wasn't quite adventurous enough to try ha ha. A+ overall. Would gladly stay again!
The airbnb is in a quiet neighborhood, but still close to the beach and all the downtown amenities. My wife and I stayed here for an drawn-out weekend anniversary getaway, and it was perfect. Star and Austin provided so many nice touches, including bikes, a hammock, beach towels, premium TV (Netflix, Prime) - even aloe vera gel in the fridge for the inevitable.
One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located. Great place.
Angela is a gracious, thoughtful, and meticulous host, and her accommodations reflect this. The living room/bedroom has all the necessary comforts, with a sofa and ample room for clothing and other travel goods. The bed is very comfortable and sleeps two adults with ease.
Angela is an amazing host and we are happily repeat guests at her place. The place is conveniently located and the bikes she provides are a great way to get around town. We highly, highly recommend staying at Angela's!
We loved everything here, from your cordial reception , attention to details, the unit location that is few minutes walk to Ashby bart station, the extra personal touch like complimentary basic food for guests,...... the list goes on. Both me and my wife love the way you decorated your unit of measurement and its cleanliness. We love to use  your kitchen too.
Paul’s place is exceptional. It’s located in a great location, very walkable area. The place is very stylist, extremely clean, and offers all the amenities you’d need.
We especially appreciated using the motorcycle to ride along the beach in the morning. It is a very short walk to the beach and nearby restaurants. I really appreciated the bite and coffee ready for us when we got there.
I would give her more than 5 stars if i could! you won’t regret it!!!! :)
We were traveling with our crawling 9-month-old and that’s always a small worrisome for a young mom, but Shelton Gill had the place so amazingly clean, it was fantastic. We were excited that the pool was still an option in early October, our little guy LOVED it, and we enjoyed it too, very brisk and refreshing temperature. The kitchen was stocked really well with cooking utensils, and some breakfast options were available, along with a great array of breakfast beverages.
We loved staying here during a work conference! The pillows were as comfortable as any hotel I’ve stayed at, and the beds and sofa were great too. I hope to stay here again someday!
Best for solo travelers or at most two people who travel light. Convenient location to beach, grocery shop , cafe, and restaurants. Ample street parking.
Paul kept the place super clean and fresh, we were really comfortable. We would recomend to stay here to anyone!
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. Tyler’s place is also extremely close to the Golden Gate Park, the deYoung Museum, public transportation, and a wide variety of restaurants & supermarkets like Safeway on 48th & Fulton. We especially loved that it was only a couple of streets away from Ocean Beach and the spectacular Sea Cliff bluffs.
There is an entry room with couch, then walk through the main bedroom/living area to get to the dining room/kitchen, and at the end of the kitchen is the bathroom. Susan provided us with local baked yummies, coffee, teas, juice, milks, fruits, oatmeal, yogurts, boiled eggs- very well stocked for breakfast. But no cooking, so we ate out for lunch and dinner, called ubereats once.
The space was cute, clean, and had good amenities. The walk to the beach was not extremely pleasant given that the house is located in an area full of strip malls. Other than that, it was a great stay!
Brian Burns was an OUTSTANDING host. What an amazing experience while staying at her place. The place was extremely clean, close to the beach, with all the amenities you will need.
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. Even though you only book a room, it is still very completely private. Most of the time we had the topographic point completely to ourselves.
! Susan was a  warm and very welcoming host, who offered many thoughtful touches to this apartment: food in the fridge, plenty of towels and blankets, and lots of suggestions for visiting Tacoma well presented in a booklet. The neighbourhood is quiet, the apartment immaculate, and the bed was Very Comfortable (so much so that we had a full night's sleep, even with jet lag!!)
We received a friendly welcome from Dan upon arrival and found the cottage spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a great shower as well as a big bath and the kitchen offered what we needed for our short stay. It was a pretty short, easy drive into San Francisco and there’s a good bar called Moxy’s just around the corner that was very handy for a quick burger and fries after our evening flight1 Overall, a very nice, conveniently located cottage that we would recommend to others.
Arthur Paddick also had thoughtful extras such as a basket of travel items in case guests forgot something - which I did so I appreciated the lotion. Thank you! There was also shampoo and conditioner in the shower as well as a coffee area and fridge.
It remained nice and warm inside even as it snowed. I definitely enjoyed the amount of pillows provided, as I’m quite picky with them and I found juuuuuust the right one. The kitchenette was definitely one of our favorite parts of the loft (aside from the gorgeous shower).
Susan didn’t miss a detail. Susan’s place is located in a great quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance of grocery stores, restaurants, pharmacies and the University of Puget Sound which is a beautiful campus. Though a bit longer, the Tacoma waterfront is walkable for those who can handle hills.
I  would ecourage anyone to stay there and I plan to use Lindsay Brown's again when visiting Seattle! !
It all worked very well for me. PERFECT topographic point to say in SF. I didn't interact with the host bcs you just let yourself in and then it's a totally private little studio, so I didn't get to meet Betty Maust but the place itself was fantastic.
We drove to the places we needed to go so I am not sure if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops. Not a problem for us but if you have a lot of heavy luggage it would be something to consider.
Robert Turpen was extremely friendly and welcoming. The backyard space was very zen and gorgeous and made us feel very comfortable and at home. The beach cruisers were also ace fun and we were very thankful we got to use them.
Angela THANKS AGAIN for being such an amazing host. Great place to stay in a great location. Angela was an awesome host and I really appreciated the small touches like a cold beer in the fridge when I got there.
The lovely courtyard with fish pond and plants is dramatic and the on site laundry much appreciated. We hope to stay here every time we're in the neighborhood.
Great views of Oakland docks and a different view of San Francisco Bay including travelling under the Bay Bridge. Christian's Airbnb was GREAT! He was a 10-minute walk from the West Oakland Bart station (one stop to downtown SF!)
My husband and I wanted to stay at a place close to LAX and quiet for one night before heading to the airport. Neva's studio was perfect. Comfortable bed and great location (only ~20 mins to LAX).
There were seven of us in total who stayed there for six nights. Lots of beautiful space to entertain us. Both inside and out.
Christiana’s personal touches make it extra special, fresh flowers, and snacks. There’s a Kuereg coffee maker with pods, a small fridge and a microwave. The studio has a real peaceful, serene vibe.
After a long day at the beach, we were able to wash away our day in the oversized  shower (loved the shower so much!) and watch movies and relax on the bed and the couch (also turns into a full size bed) with our kids. Check-out was equally as easy as check-in, we just had a really difficult time saying good bye to the place.
Finally regarding the location you cant beat it. Not on the strand directly but more tucked away in a quiet secluded neighborhood walking distance to the Redondo pier and a Whole Foods/shopping plaza. I rode the bikes and it took me about 5-10 minutes to get to the beach.
Teresa Knight's room is broad , clean and very quiet. She is also within walking distance of the Redondo Beach Pier which is a plus if you want to go down to the beach. I'd highly recommend staying there.
During the tour she pointed out helpful maps that were framed and also local restaurant menus for us to look at if we wanted to order out. She also had board game for everyone to play and a very nice Keurig machine with K-cups available. The private cozy cottage was more than I expected to be.
Great place with amazing vibe, near the pier in Redondo beach and next to Hermosa beach. We could not expect anything better for our last days in LA. The hostess Arnold Jackson was literaly a superhost, super kind an friendly.
We hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future. The plants, the lights, the hammock! All fantastic.
The guest area is very private, from the room to the bathroom and shower. It is down a path and covered in greenery so it feels very much like it's own separate house. The outdoor bathroom is really clean and nice and showering in the green house was very special.
My husband and I travel a lot and I can say conclusively this was the most adorable place we have ever stayed in. If you appreciate fine detail, this is the topographic point to stay! It was just a short walk to the beach, ecological preserve (hiking), and good restaurants.
Angela’s place was exactly as-described, and exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for in an AirBnB for a first-time trip to San Francisco. It was just far enough away from the crazy city bustle to be able to relax when we wanted, but yet a 5-minute walk to shops and some seriously awesome food right in Bernal (GO TO TAQUERIA CANCUN), as well as a quick (~15 minute ) Uber/Lyft ride away from everything we wanted to do in the city (we could go out and do things in the city and come back to change/relax/drop things off multiple times per day without wasting much time). The place itself was very clean, and had some really nice amenities, such as a great shower, good size fridge, comfortable bed, and ever-important coffee.
Location can’t be beat, right smack dab in Chicago. The room had a good lock on the door so it really felt secure. Don’t hesitate to book this awesome place!
Third, it was super clean and stylish. She stated that even though she knew it was a safe neighborhood, she wanted to make sure her guests felt safe at all times. Another thing I liked was everything was close by (2-3 mins away) such as grocery stores, Starbucks, other types of restaurants, and even Planet fitness.
Despite being designed as an open space, the layout of the farm is situated such that it felt really private. I needed a place to stay while I was in Oakland for a few days, and this was the perfect spot. I love how secluded the studio is; there are beautiful plants and trees surrounding it.
They have 2 sweet pooches who are out on the shared patio at times. Was nice because we needed some pet therapy! The bathroom has a great shower, good water pressure, loved both the mirrors and the well thought out positioning.
She responded to questions and requests in a very timely and upbeat manner. The room itself is bigger than I expected, which was nice as my husband ended up needing to do some work. The room had a desk space and we weren't on top of each other while he worked and I relaxed and read.
I had a great stay at Pat & Barb’s place. It was well located and easy to get around with shops and restaurant nearby. The room is a good size, comfortable bed, nice cross breeze with the window open and very relaxing after a full day out house hunting.
Chris goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The book with all the advice and transportation tips were so helpful, it made eating and getting around much easier !! Also the stocked fridge with juices, expensive granola, and toiletries provided was very much appreciated.
Bennie Dudgeon greeted us and I immediately felt at home. with coffee maker, fridge, and fresh water. The beds were SO comfortable as was the bathroom.
The neighborhood is transitional as described but the 5 days we were there we did not have any disturbance from the neighbors and nothing in the neighborhood caused us a problem or gave us concern. We hope to see Geneva and John Mullins again! !
It was clean, great location- so close to the beach, airport, awesome amenities, private. She has bikes and beach chairs and even a boogie board! We loved the thoughtful things like coffee, some bottles of water, nice fluffy towels and really comfy bed!
Igor and May are very friendly and gracious hosts. The home is very clean and meticulous. Parking is convenient.
Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.
Marcos Blount is one of my favorite Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. The location was perfect, easy walk to the beach and pier. The space was very clean, bright & comfortable.
The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.) Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.
Super cute, stylish, and clean. She was quick to reply when we had questions. The only thing I want to note is if you’re new to NYC this location is about 20-40 minutes Uber from most of the site seeing we did.
I think) .. Shelton Gill had chair , umbrellas, beach towels and blankets we were able to bring to the beach with us. We appreciated everything about our stay. If we make our way back down to Virginia Beach, Shelton Gill’s place will be the first place we look up.
Super convenient. I can’t say enough great things about this place- top notch!!! !
Tiana is extremely friendly and super hospitable. Very clean, spacious and bright. A special thank you to her mom and Paul to making us feel like home :) we will be back!!!!
We stayed a long weekend with four adults and a baby. The cottage was beautifully decorated and very comfortable for all of us. The location is amazing, near the beach and walking distance to many restaurants.
We had a great stay at Tyler's place! The room feels like a really nice hotel room with every thoughtful amenity you could imagine. The fridge was even stocked with local beer and cold beverage .
I took him to Disneyland on day 3 and she gave us all the tips to navigate the park and probably saved us hours with her inside knowledge. Angela's Bungalow was exactly how we thought it would be, amazing! She was such a great host starting from check in, she checked in on us mid way through our trip and when we checked out.
The cottage is surrounded by beautiful trees and plants and there are many parks to explore in the area too. They had all the amenities needed and provided nice additional items like chocolate, tea, and an extensive selections of books as well. I met Robert Turpen multiple times during my stay; they were nice to talk to and they gave me multiple arrow on things to in the area that suited my interest.
I was there during a heat wave and while there's no air conditioning, fans kept the rooms cool. The neighboring streets are delightful, the decor in Susan and Khahn’s lovely suite is perfect, but what takes this place above and beyond the norm are the thoughtful touches Susan has added for each moment. From earplugs, water and caramels by the bed, ( both sides!!)
We absolutely loved staying with Ralph and Laura! The place was so clean and comfortable - it really did feel like a home away from home. The property was easy to find, and Ralph and Laura greeted us as we got there.
Elizabeth’s place is very nice and the location is outstanding, and I know because I grew up here. It’s quiet, convenient, and close the beach. Plus it’s only a short drive to Hermosa and Manhattan Beach.
Heather is the epitome of “super host”! I am originally from Tacoma, so if you were wondering about the location, it is very central to everything in Tacoma! We visited family in Lakewood, which only took about a fifteen minute drive and then we went out to dinner on the other side of Tacoma and that was only a ten minute drive.
i was really impressed by all the small thoughtful touch that made the space feel incredibly homey and not just a place to sleep. i can't say enough good things about her and her space. we would definitely come back!
We had an excellent stay at Tyler’s place. Also deserving mentioning is the access to a washer and dryer - when you’re away from home for almost 2 weeks, it’s beyond helpful to be able to have a chance to do some laundry and have more clean apparel . Thanks Tyler for setting up a very lovely place for guests!
Thanks for a great stay :) Great value for the price scope ! I was very pleased.
Tiana is extremely friendly and ace hospitable. !
We didn’t even get around to playing pool on the pool table. No guest should ever be bored here.
The loft is very spacious, stylish, comfortable, surprisingly private despite the location, and secure. The bed were comfortable, the bathroom up-to-date with an excellent shower, very clean… We had everything we needed. James Walker and Debra Dibble were very helpful, checking in by text to make sure all was well.
So only a short bus ride and tube to central New York in about 25 minutes. Friendly host, nice and quiet neighborhood. The room is clean and comfortable.
Even better than mine at home! Ken and Kurt are the perfect hosts and such lovely people we really felt at home with them. The area felt safe and very close to walk to little Italy for some lovely food.
This was our first stay at an Airbnb, and we couldn't have been happier. The location of his apartment is fantastic. It's easy to get to and close to a batch of great restaurants.
First off she is very easy to communicate with from the initial request to the day you leave. She offers you your own deck with comfy chairs and a beautiful yard and a view of puget sound. You walk in to a modestly charming modern looking living room, with still a perfect view of the water and large chairs and couch.
Stephane’s place is an adorable, very well decorated & clean basement suite in a very nice part of Tacoma, equip with all you need including A/C! We felt very safe. The Robert Huckabaa bed is extremely comfortable!
Quirky, unique apartment in the attic space of a gorgeous old house. The neighborhood is full of grand old homes and we loved going for an evening stroll and admiring everyone's gardens. Jeanna's place is a 20-minute walk to the waterfront, and about a $10-$12 Lyft ride to downtown, where there are plenty of fun bars and restaurants to choose from.
Brent is very responsive and available to provide any help and answer any questions. To top it off, her communication was perfect. She messaged a couple days prior to update us on our early check in request, checked in with us after we arrived to make sure we were able to settle in and to see if we needed anything.
I have been to many airb bnbs across the world, and this is the one I have felt most welcomed at. It’s a very private place that is well put together—I would be so happy to stay here again and would definitely recommend it to a family or friend staying in the  area. What a wonderful place.
Angele is really warm hearted. Parking is very easy here, you can park at her driveway so don’t worry about that. She also provides us with bicycle so we can took a motorcycle trip along Redondo Beach and Manhattan beach.
Paul was so nice, we felt like we knew him for years. Paul is always responsive and actively communicates with his guests. The place is wonderful and is a short walk to the beach!
The only thing I can complain about is not having enough time to enjoy this space to the fullest, since I was in town for a work event and had to leave at 7 the next morning. Growing up in Seattle we laughed at Tacoma and while it's true that the "aroma of Tacoma" still wafts about in the sea air the city itself has been quietly reinventing itself for the better part of a decade. Having NOT torn down its old buildings, the visitor is now treated to a thriving creative laboratory housed in weird cool milieu .
There were bottles of water, juices, and yogurts in the fridge. Bathroom is super nice! The overall Airbnb is very spacious and very clean and has a cunning flower garden out back!
We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Mona's topographical point again! The place is decorated super cute and trendy. It felt like we were staying in a Pinterest/Instagram dream.
The kitchen is spacious and fully equipped with plenty of counter space and everything needed to prepare a few meals. Leslie has obviously gone out of her way to make sure everything is well-labeled which makes finding things much easier in the kitchen and throughout the home! The informal dining table in the kitchen worked well for us when dining at home.
The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. That's a plus for me ,because I really enjoy my breakfast smoothies . The bed and the sofa-bed are high quality and super comfortable.
I loved being able to have a cup of coffee in my room and takin my time getting up. I could sit comfortably in the glider reading or propped up in bed with four pillows. I enjoyed getting local fruits and keeping them on hand with the mini fridge.
Do head over to the nearby Bernal Heights Park, hike up to the top for amazing 360 view of San Francisco and a cute swing on a tree! It was very comfortable chatting with him. We definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn’t mind a little bit of climb to get to the house and also doesn’t mind staying outside the city.
Linda is super easy to reach, responds promptly and is super kind. They do make sure you have all the privacy you need so interacting is completely optional. We felt we could relax and didn’t feel obligated to interact...we just chose to do so.
The private parking lot in the back was a major plus and the area was very safe and trendy with lots of shops and restaurants up Milwuakee Ave. Ewa provided many different amenities when we checked in and lots of useful local tips. Overall great experience and would definitely come back again!! Thank you Ewa!
Neva's in-law unit was the perfect location for a little weekend getaway at the end of a week of conferences in LA. Neva was also kind enough to let us use the patio to host two of our friends for a small . We'd definitely book again.
And they have coaster ! I sent some of my friend’s the link and they loooooved it! So many regard on the place!
We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Crystal Romero's place again! There was a bottle of wine, beer, and snacks waiting for us. We took full advantage of that Had a wonderful nights sleep, and woke up to an email asking if everything went ok our first night...which it did.
The topographic point is decorated super cute and trendy. We recommend this place to anyone that wants a secluded getaway, and to be right at the beach. Can't say enough about this super clean, hip apartment.
We had a great time at Scott's place. Loved staying here and would definitely come back.
! All in all, I don't believe you'll regret staying here!
We were pooped and called it a night. When we woke up the view was amazing! We had some coffee and just relaxed for the morning.
We want to come back soon for a quick weekend getaway and maybe bring the kids next time. Thank you Dasha for everything. :)
With its own entrance the whole space, inside and out, felt very private. It was super clean too! We would highly recommend this space as it was much nicer and way less expensive than a luxury hotel.
A cozy, clean and comfortable spot in the historic North End! No detail is overlooked in Stephanie's unfussy, light-filled basement apartment: fully equipped kitchen with all the necessities, bathroom stocked with toiletries,  parking spot right out front, washer and dryer, etc. We only stayed two nights while visiting family in the neighborhood but can imagine this would be the perfect place for longer stays in Tacoma.
With luxurious touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. This place is awesome! Great location, beautiful walk to the BART, and walking distance to a number of amazing local mainstays and businesses in a hip part of town.
We were so pleased with everything else, we would forfeit those for what we did have. Oh, and we LOVED having Netflix available. This was Richard Batton and mine once a year get away from the duty of life (kids, dogs, careers) and we loved the ability to “Netflix and chill” w each other.
We love the kitchen and dinning area where we cooked breakfast and heated up leftovers. But we don’t get too much noise in the bedrooms.
Loved the little back yard oasis where our daughter enjoyed taking some amazing pictures. Thank you for letting us use your washer, dryer and the scale. We were so glad that we got to meet you, your husband Edwin Green and your so called ‘naughty’ dog (which he was so not!).
She has done a fantastic job making sure no detail is forgotten. We ate in several nice restaurants close to the house and even caught a movie in the lovely nostalgic Alameda Theatre. Beautiful home, beautiful area.
Quiet and a great set up for me, my 11 year old son and my sister as we explored New York City. I am from Queens, NY. I come occasionally to visit and this time I brought a friend with me.
We can’t wait to go back! !
Everything was as expected and described perfectly. The bathroom is very clean and updated. Tammy and Marc have added several thoughtful touches that make you feel very comfortable during your stay.
If you don't want to be stuck in a high rise condominium next to rowdy college child , this is the place for you! Man, it’s really hard to explain the amount of comfort, appreciation and hospitality that Brent provided. No exaggeration when I say I felt as if I were at home, didn’t have to ask for anything.
We also hit a new spot called Wooden City on Pacific (GOOD FOOD & friendly service) and HONEY COFFEE at Alma Mater for breakfast (they had super yum meat, veg & vegan options + pastries and really good coffee). Looking forward to visiting again. THANKS DENISE!
The kitchen is fully stocked, good for cooking your own meals. Clean bathroom/shower with water that stays hot. Lots of books that I wish I had time to read!
You can hear his family walking in the apartment upstairs, but that is the nature of apartment living, and did not detract at all from the comeliness of the apartment. We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in Chicago once more.
there's the cutest private garden right outside the backdoor, perfect for lounging in the morning with a cup of tea or at night near the outdoor fire pit with a glass of wine. the place was quiet at night and has a ace comfy bed. we didn't cook much in the space, but the kitchen was stocked with all the basics, including a coffee machine.
Her loft is in a great central location in downtown Tacoma within walking distance of theatres, museums, UW-Tacoma, restaurants, etc. Gloria was very responsive, responding to our messages within seconds, and offering very clear instructions for entry and leaving. The loft is very stylish, very clean, and comfortable with great amenities [e.g., internet, washer/dryer, French press and coffee, snacks, eggs, etc.].
I phoned my family every other day. Hope we weren't too much of a nuisence over our lack of knowledge on mod cons like coffee makers and Betty Maust. We'd love to come back.
Rayford Kelly thoughtfully furnished room felt more like a self sufficient home. We had everything we needed and then some. She had a huge variety of teas and coffee to choose from.
Granola and fresh fruit and dainty from a nearby bakery. And little handwritten notes everywhere. It is clear that James Walker enjoys being an airbnb host and truly cares about her guest .
Marcia shared some tips on best time of day to go which was helpful so I could collect some shells for my kids! The bed was cozy and the Alexa was helpful because I always fall asleep to music and I forgot my Bluetooth speaker. So glad Alexa could lullaby me to .
Elizabeth's place is fantastic. The room is huge, with a very large comfortable bed and great amenities. Everything was great and we were sad to leave.
Susan’s home was our first Airbnb experience. We were pampered and spoiled and are eternally grateful for the experience!
Learned that the property was built in 1913 including the in law suite. Angela goes out of her way as a Host and genuinely cares about your experience. She has created a welcoming place and is always available.
In my three years of experience with Airbnb, staying at Angela’s place is bar none the best experience I’ve ever had with an Airbnb listing. Angela and her cozy oasis truly surpassed all of my expectations. After sharing with her the reason for my stay, she completely went out of her way to think of every detail and amenity that I needed to feel comforted and at home.
She is an exceptional decorator; the place exudes warmth and character. It is a great location close to the beach with easy parking. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to the pier.
I swear we didn’t want to leave. When we first got there, we found post-it notes all around the place with instructions that made it easy to settle in. We met up with Marcos Blount for a spot who welcomed us and made us feel at home.
There is a full kitchen and it is stocked with pot and pans, dishes, silverware, condiment , coffee pot, coffee and tea. This has definitely become my home away from home. The cottage was small but we fit 4 adults perfectly all right .
Great value and location. The bedroom is huge, with a lovely bathroom and closet. Bonus for all the extra linens, iron and ironing board, and bedding.
Very close to Redondo Beach and we loved biking around, it was a nice touch! Very clean and nicely decorated. We had 4 people stay and the extra bed (futon) is not very comfy but we were only there 2 nights and switched with the other couple.
The backyard of the bungalow area was so so cute and one of our favorite parts about the place. We used them every day and biked up to Manhattan Beach. I would HIGHLY recommend staying in Angela's Bungalow, and I know she also offers a single room in her house as well which I am sure is equally as great!
The room itself is bigger than I expected, which was nice as my husband ended up needing to do some work. We felt this spot was a super value and we would come back to it the next time we find ourselves in the area. And I highly recommend a low- cardinal bike ride up and down The Strand.
The bed is comfortable and the linens are clean and soft (and there are excess in the linen closet which is always nice!). Star and Austin's place is perfect for a getaway to the beach! The location, just about 2 blocks from the ocean, makes it super easy to get to the boardwalk and the sand.
Tiana was a great host! Her response was quick and she was always caring about us. The cottage was really clean and cozy that  we spend our time like real home:) The location was great too, near the Redond beach!!
there is great detail paid to the extra particular touches like soft sheets, comfy bed and plush towels. I was visiting the Tacoma/Seattle area as a solo vacation trip and they were super helpful and responsive in terms of ideas of local attractions and what I should make time to see and any questions I had in general. This was my first airbnb experience and I would absolutely visit their home again if I am back in Tacoma.
We did however make good use of the beach chairs, which we very much appreciated! We truly hope we find our way back to Redondo and are able to stay in this beautiful guest house again, hopefully for a little longer next time!
About 10 min walk to the 16th St BART, which is convenient if traveling to and from airport. Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed amenities. The building itself is pretty quiet, though I’d recommend ear plugs for sleeping if you’re sensitive to any street noise (passing cars etc).
Brent is very responsive and available to provide any help and answer any questions. Everything about our stay was wonderful. The place was very clean and had everything we needed!Katherine has put time and effort into the thoughtful details of the offerings of her Airbnb.
She added all if these extra touches that made it so homey and comfortable. It would also be a great place to relax with your favorite evening beverage. She had soft lighting out there as well, which added a beautiful atmosphere in the nighttime.
The cottage is best if just 2 people. Perfect size for a young couple’s getaway.
Guys! Michael is an absolutely wonderful host; his work and art literature can be found spread all over the studio, it is quite inspiring. The place is nestled in a lovely block on River North practically unnoticed to the eye if you are not paying attention.
When I pulled out the sofa bed at  night and closed the door, I got privacy and the living room turned into a second bedroom. The cottage is also super affordable, we paid half the cost of what a hotel was charging us in the area and got so much more. It’s also a mile from restaurants and grocery stores which we went to often.
Elizabeth’s home was warm, inviting, and so clean. The check in and check out process was simple. The bed was so amazingly comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud!
We found the inclusion of some fun games and activity to be very charming as well. Wow ... what a sweet little cottage by the beach ... all the amenities, and Chip is an exemplary host - flexible, cordial and there if needed ... full access to yard and beach, with high tides rising half way up the bulkhead - a few feet down the ladder and you are in the swim - seriously, who needs a dock ... still, I might want flippers in those waters - the current looks swift to me ... still, a great place to swim, if you can handle the cold ... water clear, you can see through to the rocks at the bottom ... anyway, a great place to stay, a wonderful getaway, spring green forest - and more affordable than any hotels/motels in the area ... there are some other AirBnB locations, a few bead and breakfasts on the islands ... most look more expensive to me ... so, if you are looking to spend some time at the beach, in a lovely, quiet space - right on the beach - check in with Chip ... you'll be happy you did!
The floors were clean enough that I walked around barefoot without an issue. The house was temperature controlled and the door had a keyless entry number pad. The best part of the stay was Joe himself.
Elizabeth was fantastic. She is very friendly and the space exceeded our expectations. Great room with plenty of space and private bath.
We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus. We'll definitely look here first on our following trip to Chicago!
Bathroom was well lighted, only a few steps away, and immaculate with plush towels, shampoo and conditioner, soap, and decent hairdryer. Plenty of warm water with good pressure. Would absolutely stay here again, pleasant, good location, and very safe.
I especially enjoy riding bikes and loved the trail! We expect to stay there again on our next visit.
The building was easy to find and check-in and check-out were fast and painless. I definitely hope to stay here again the next time I'm in SF!
I've found my second home! Some days after teaching I am too tired to drive home. Proctor Cottage is a perfect respite.
The house is really beautiful and the room was very clean and has a stylisch equipment. Be aware that parking is extremely expensive everywhere in San Francisco.
I have been to many airb bnbs across the world, and this is the one I have felt most welcomed at. Raquel Eastham has though of everything in terms of hospitality: easy check in, snacks and wine at your leisure, and a beautiful, waterfront meticulous, cozy place. We had our own parking area and a welcome sign—My husband and I even joked, wondering if Raquel Eastham wanted some roommates!!!
I have stayed in many AirBnBs, and this place was at the top. T communicated well throughout my entire stay. She is an exceptional decorator; the place exudes warmth and character.
But that being said, the guest register reflected that many other couples had stayed there and were perfectly comfortable. No. More than that.
Zeena also gave us trip details regarding attractions in the area and it was a pleasure we took that into considerations. Zeena truly is the hostess with the most ! A delightful, positive person with tons of great energy!
Location can’t be beat, right smack dab in Chicago. Lotsa restaurants and bars and little shops around. Quick few blocks walk to the parks- I walked from apt to Millennium Park in 18 mins, and even in January temperatures, it was a lovely walk.
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. I would definitely recommend staying here, Marcia has many nice touch and the unit is private and a good monetary value .
The littles extras such as coffee, homemade bread and jam and fruit was a lovely touch to making us feel comfortable in their home. There’s enough space to hang up your clothes, we didn’t need lots of space so the room size was perfect for us. A MUST is to catch the ferry from Oakland Ferry Port to San Francisco Bay Ferry Building or Pier 41.
It's perfectly located to our planned activities and is easy to get to and from. It's a cute, cozy, and very clean cottage/cabin. We appreciate that Geneva makes it fragrance free, and has fragrance free products so people like us who suffer from chemical sensitivities can avoid hotels and feel like you're home.
Her bungalow was adorable and charming. It had all of the amenities you would need and Angela was always easy to reach. Angela provided welcome snacks, eggs and bread.
This apartment worked out splendidly for us - a couple with a two year old spending five days exploring Tacoma. We got in after midnight, but she was happy to show us around, and even brought us fresh popcorn! The space is equipped with all the kitchen and bath supplies you would need, including a Keurig coffee maker and K-Cups, drinks in the fridge, a microwave, toaster over, etc.
Liz’s home is beautiful, spotless, and comfortable, and it’s located just a few blocks from beach. She is a fantastic host! She truly thought of everything and was prompt in replying any time I had a question.
She's probably the most genuine airbnb host I've ever had thus far! We loved the location away from the hustle and bustle of Tacoma, but still close enough to go into town for the day. The house itself is immaculate, welcoming, stylish and roomy enough for the 6 of us to be more than comfortable.
I also forgot I left an unopened bagged salad in the fridge so the next people who show up have a salad they can eat! Other notes, idk how to set up the wii but it’s okay because I enjoyed tv instead. :) Thank you Brian and Hillary!
What really solidified my confidence in staying in this home was Susan’s hospitality. Another plus, was the proximity to activities and restaurants! Thank you for having us!
The neighborhood is beautiful. !
It was perfect for me traveling alone but know that you basically have just the bed and a tiny bathroom. Overall, this is an awesome spot, particularly if you're just looking for a place to crash between LA touring and beach living!
I contact Tony and Anita to ask what I should do. Unfortunately we didn’t get to spend very much time here. I wish we would have had a longer stay so we could enjoy this cozy space longer.
This place was really cute and well-prepared. Elizabeth was a wonderful hostess and the area was fantastic. Would book again.
The place was very clean and stylish. There is a house manual that is pretty helpful and the hosts provide their contact info too! They offer an excellent amount of snacks for you and your guests.
This IS the Airbnb ultimate experience! I will definitely stay there again. Thank you Michelle!
 tons of restaurants nearby. The bedroom is large and comfortable. Scott welcomed us to use his large kitchen and outdoor patio area.
I was in town for a wedding and wanted to stay close to the beach. This space is even bigger in person than I expected from the photos! Paul was so friendly and welcoming.
Highly recommend! Elizabeth Jones is an amazing host and we are happily repeat guests at her place. She is very responsive and provides you with everything you need during your stay.
Ken and Curt’s place is perfect; a home away from home. We loved all the extra touches — great art and stylish space, snacks and nespresso, a booklet full of Chicago suggestions, extra Ventra cards, and even classical music playing upon our arrival! Their hospitality made this one of our favorite Airbnb experiences.
It's walking distance around the corner from a restaurant + bar (Hudson House) owned by Top Chef alum Brooke (we went for dinner twice), and walkable to a lot of other fantastic espresso/coffee places. My husband and I would LOVE to stay here again!
You will not find a warmer, more professional host than Elizabeth. Her home is beautiful, immaculately presented and quiet, and just a short walk to the beach and shops. It’s perfect - a five star experience for me!
Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Laurie and Ron. Everything has been considered regarding the comfort of their guests. The spacious room looks out over a lovely private brick garden courtyard, a peaceful setting for contemplation, reading, getting away from the craziness of the outside world.
We would definitely go back. Arnold Jackson gave us a warm welcome to this beautiful place. Little things like the coffee and bikes really made you feel at home.
The location of his apartment is fantastic. He has a lovely terrace filled with flowers, which was a perfect place to relax. His apartment is decorated with a lot of alone and fascinating items.
We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. They both went out of their way to help us and make us comfortable. We will be back next time we are in Chicago!
Also see my review December 2017. Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed.
This was an amazing place to stay! Perfect size to accommodate a group traveling along with a stocked kitchen! The place was super clean, beds very comfortable, and all the personal touches really brought our stay over the top.
The cottage is also super affordable, we paid half the cost of what a hotel was charging us in the area and got so much more. Heather is the epitome of “super host”! When we checked in, she was not there at the time (volunteering), but we talked on the phone!
Hosts don't get much more welcoming than Michael! He makes you feel right at home straight away. Upon arriving he immediately offered me a drink, we sat and chatted for a while and then he kindly left me to do my own thing.
Lovely place to stay during my first (hopefully, not the last) trip to San Francisco. I arrived rather late in the evening (around 9:30ish), and Alejandrina Anderson came out to greet me and show me the place. As a solo traveler, it’s important for me to feel safe and secure wherever I’m staying ... even more so when being so far from home.
This place was awesome! It had a private entrance, small patio, and bikes etc available. The bed was very comfortable.
Chuck even provided an abundant bowl of candy in each room, I found this inspired. I would go back without a moment of hesitation. I truly enjoyed my stay at the Wiseacre Estate.
Tammy and Marc's place is just amazing! Nice location - close to the beach. Room was small but excellent!
We arrived to find coffee and tea waiting, which was perfect after a long day of travel. It is the best Ikea styling I have ever seen in real life. In fact, Ikea would do well to stage a photo shoot here.
Check in was easy. Thanks Igor!
The great thing, these were all within biking / walking distance of Star and Lindsay Brown’s topographic point . Gregory Simons's lovely place deserves every one of it's five star reviews. I'll add mine to the list!
Nice private room, with a firm/squeaky bed. beautiful house, in a nice neighbourhood. Gin and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning!
When we wanted to stay an additional day, he couldn’t accommodate us because the guesthouse was already rented out for the following day but he made a few calls and found us another Airbnb to stay in! Thanks again Bennie Dudgeon!
We were visiting for our 10th wedding anniversary and she made our stay extra special with many thoughtful touches. The place is cozy, comfortable, stylish and there are so many small details that make it feel just like home. Location is excellent with many amenities within walking distance.
Linda and Dan's cottage is the perfect place to relax after the hustle and bustle of a jam packed vacation. My husband and I were inspired by this space, with its simplicity and aesthetic. The bathroom is to die for, and we did not take the claw foot tub for granted.
The patio garden is very pretty and Luis Hawkins was so adorable and calm. She also gave us a crib for my baby. As a former resident from the east bay, the location is just perfect—lots of shops and restaurants on the main street, nice and safe neighborhood,  close to SF, near berkeley,  also close to korean restaurants.
This was a nice little place for a one night stay in the city. The place is right next to a beautiful park that we walked to in the afternoon it was just really nice. Thanks for a lovely stay Angela!
We loved the quiet neighborhood and the ease of extra parking on the quiet side street just a half block away. The location is minutes from the freeway, UPS, old town Tacoma and Ruston Way. So happy to have picked this spot- thanks again and we will see you again!
I love how secluded the studio is; there are beautiful plants and trees surrounding it. The furniture is super comfortable, and the amenities  shocked me. I had everything I needed.
They even offered their laundry facilities! They both are polite, compassionate, and real people. Their place is truly a reprieve .
Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! I also walked over to Berkeley Bowl for some groceries and business district Berkeley for some dinner. Debra Dibble was very responsive - and made checkin/checkout a breeze.
We  thoroughly enjoyed our first Redondo experience. Scott's house has a lot of his personal touches to it and it reflects well onto you when you are inside with his colors and arts. It gives the house that much more niceness in its space.
These include the signage throughout the place, the ability to have a place for dirty towels, the quality sheets, the fabulous decor, shampoo and soap for showers, the walking distance location, secure access to the building, ability to lock the room, news quietly on in the morning in the main area, cool multi-plug device next to bed for cell phones and more, continental breakfast, and I could go... Awesome accommodations if you're in need of a individual room! The price seemed too good to be true, and it still does!
Highly recommended !! Tammy and Janet Luckman were really kind, nice and helpful! The topographic point is cosy in a very nice location, close to the beach.
What an amazing experience while staying at her place. I highly recommend Angela and her amazing place. Deborah Hines for being such an amazing host.
We stayed for 5 days, and had a very enjoyable stay. He gave us restaurant recommendation , which definitely made our stay better! You can hear his family walking in the apartment upstairs, but that is the nature of apartment living, and did not detract at all from the loveliness of the apartment.
The accommodations felt thoughtful. Shantell Preusser’s place was an easy walk to my venue on the beach. She was super helpful at getting me in the house and even had a gallon of water waiting for me.
Still a 5 star Airbnb - but would be important for other wheelchair users to know. The location 2 blocks from the beach yet in a quiet neighborhood can’t be beat. It was a quick walk to the beach to watch the evening sunset.
The bed was wonderfully comfortable, full cable television and a large and well-equipped bathroom. It's located a hop, skip and a jump from the beach and the Marina. We could not have been more pleased.
The location was perfect for us as we come to Tacoma to visit family in the Proctor area, a short drive away. Stephanie is a lovely host. She introduced herself to us when we checked in and was very available and responsive during our stay whenever we had questions.
Folks - This place and experience is AMAZING. When we first thought of booking I was hesitant due to the owner being on-site, after discussing with my wife and family we decided to give it a try. First - the home is amazing, the views, the water, the evidence everything is immaculate and breathtaking.
It was very well located, near many restaurants with diverse cuisine, as well as very close to the lovely Lake Merritt, Children's Fairyland, and not too far a walk to the BART and downtown Oakland. We mainly used the house as a base to explore San Francisco, travelling mainly by shared Lyft rides ( a nice way to meet the friendly people of the Bay Area!) as well as by BART.
Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. I've stayed at 3 airbnb's in Tacoma and this is by far the best deal, and tickled my inner clean freak so much. And thank you, Susan, for accommodating us an extra day!
The pictures represent it perfectly; it is exactly as lovely, bright, airy, and comfortable as it appears! The cottage has everything you need to feel immediately at home, check in and check out a breeze, great food in walking distance, and the beautiful beach steps away — I woke up to the sound of crashing waves every morning. Absolutely a five star experience.
We are so glad that we chose to stay there. We visited San Francisco on our honeymoon and weren't   certain what to expect since neither one of us had ever been to the west coast. We completely fell in love with it!
There were many amenities thrown in and water in the fridge. Very close to beach. We will definitely be back.
And the host is kind very much. Before I been there, the host sent me  a lot of notes to help me find this house. And I didn’t know how to turn off the panel light of mine rental car.
Very clean and comfortable updated bathroom and bedroom. Hermosa Beach is the best beach in Southern California and if you are looking for a small beach town, village feel, this is for you. The hosts are amazing and provide everything needed, including bikes, boogie boards, beach chairs and towels.
We wanted quiet and privacy, and this suits the bill perfectly. We hardly heard a sound our entire stay -- I think we heard one car drive by on the road. We didn't run into Lindsay Brown while we were there, but he let us know he was available and he responded immediately to any message .
Proctor Cottage is an excellent value and I highly recommend it. It is well located with easy access to businesses and highways but still quiet and private. The small cottage is beautiful inside and out.
Close to Train Station. Beautiful houses and yard in the neighborhood made my walk to the train station very enjoyable. Thank you Igor.
Heather is the epitome of “super host”! She then brought our daughter popcorn back and we chatted for a while; she is just the sweet person ever! The cottage was absolutely perfect for our little family and it was nice that Heather had book and games for us to play with!
Even though we arrived very late, Laurel and Skye made our check-in easy and had left some lights on to show us the way. The cottage is very well appointed and  we found everything neat, tidy and very clean. We would definitely recommend this rental to other visitors to Oakland.
Erik Dickson is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! The second day on arrival she checked in with us to see if everything was all right . There's also a library of books regarding SF history, tours, to borrow at your disposal.
Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. After spending 11 nights at Susan's place, I can tell you the suite is great. It's quiet, spacious and spotless.
This place was perfect and priced extremely well! Both awesome places!! Highly recommend this place you will not be disappointed!!
Heather and JP have thought of everything you will need to enjoy your stay. We loved the privacy of the location. It was so hip and stylish, as well as super comfy.
Elizabeth was super friendly and helpfull, she even checked us in earlier. Honestly, you cannot go wrong with it.
Dennis Steward was a very great host! She accommodated to all our needs and even to our late check in due to the drive! It was a very clean and homey house that made traveling feel more like moving in for three days.
And they have coasters! I love the earthy artsy vibe a ton. And at the price!!!
The loft is very close to Downtown and major sights with easy acces to public transportation. Anyway, you won’t be disturbed in the loft - t’s quite and peaceful up here. The host is very nice and helpful.
Outdoor area was a nice touch. We would definitely recommend and stay again - thank you, Neva!
Jo's place is centrally located in Tacoma. Stores, museums, exhibits, pubs, local colleges, shops, restaurants, bus line and not one but two hospitals. There's even a park just a few steps away.
With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. Paul is a supper host! He is friendly and always available to give advice or just a chat.
Giant room finished with fantastic material . Such a great location: quiet neighborhood close to the beach and Redondo ship shops. And Cher Alexander recommended an amazing new restaurant!
The Neighborhood felt very safe and quiet. The flower vines were in bloom, the view walking up onto the deck and the details of decor even on the outside let us know this place was special! There was enough space to have a wonderful stay in a fun house with every amenity!
We also needed a ride to the grocery store that next morning (around 9 am). She also responds very quickly to any texts/messages, so getting in contact with her was never a problem. And she makes sure to let you know that if you ever need her, for anything, to just let her know.
It is amazing everything you might have forgotten to bring he has and shares with you. A true godsend when you are many miles from home! Would love to come again when we can really enjoy all the house has to offer and relax and not march to a wedding’s timetable!
This air bnb was great. The space was super cute and also had everything you needed for an extended stay. It was located a couple blocks from the boardwalk, which was totally walkable and very conveniently located to grocery stores, shops and places to dine by bike ride, short Uber ride or walking.
The airbnb is in a quiet neighborhood, but still close to the beach and all the downtown comforts . They recommended great restaurants and provided what we needed for our days at the beach. I would definitely stay at this airbnb again when visiting Virginia Beach.
And another plus, Heather's house is directly behind the cottage. Then interior of the cottage is spotlessly clean, and more than adequately supplied with all the amenities that you would need for your stay there. I would highly recommend the Private Cozy Cottage for your next stay in the area.
The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. Had a wonderful stay at Angela’s. I was traveling for work, and this conveniently located unit had everything I needed - comfortable bed, fast Arnold Jackson, a solid workspace and great bath comforts - all in a cozy unit.
Great parking, too, with tons of room in the driveway and seems like a very safe area. We highly recommend this Airbnb.
I just loved it!! This is now on my "favorite's" list. Susan greeted me and showed me around.
He has thought through every single detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robes - he has anticipated his guest ' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special. !
Tony and Attina were there as needed, friendly when we saw them and eager to make our stay fantastic, even giving us a late check out which was very much appreciated. The beaches and parks are a short drive and the history of the area was fun to discover. Stay here if ever in the area.
I live in Tacoma and have traveled the world for 25+ years, and must say I plan to again drive the 3 miles from my home to Crystal Romero's studio, just to take a "stay-cation". My best advice is to book early. Janet Luckman!
We arrived at 11 pm at night but she was there to greet us and check us in which we appreciated. She light up candles at the outdoor terrace which was a nice surprise and felt nice and very beautiful after a long day of sightseeing. She Left us a nice Jennifer Merry breakfast once which was very thoughtful.
We felt extremely comfortable, the room is modern and chic, everything you could wish for, even Aveda Shampoo...perfect down to the very last detail. The location is simply unbeatable, Fillmore Street around the corner with great shops and restaurants. Jeff & Mike were perfect hosts.
His place was the perfect spot for me and my husband. I can’t rave enough! There’s an amazing walkable vegan restaurant for breakfast/ lunch and coffee shops from his place as well as an N train stop just a block away.
This small apartment has everything you may need and more!! She provided so much information such as where we can order food, close shopping centers and restaurants! Thank you so much for everything Maggie & Jon!
Relatively close to lax. Elizabeth Jones lives downstairs and rents three rooms upstairs. No ailment !
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. We stayed at Tyler's place to visit San Francisco at the end of our roadtrip through the states. When we arrived we were allready briefed on how to check in and we also recieved some guidelines.
My husband and I were thrilled that we decided to stay in Gig Harbor for our anniversary weekend. The location felt like a secret hideaway, with Zeena's designer touches making it feel warm and inviting. Having breakfast served both days was so very special.
All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and I'd happily return. This topographical point is PHENOMENAL!!! Words can't describe how lovely having a glass of wine on the patio in bloom is while surrounded by the incredible sights and sounds of the city!
The room itself was better than expected. It was a large and modern space. The room was clean, linens were fresh, and there more than enough towels and washcloths made available.
It is beautifully decorated and the hosts have thought of everything! It is very welcoming and comfortable. My daughter and I spent the afternoon there before going out to dinner.
Her beautiful home is quiet. Safe parking in her driveway. I will definitely stay with her again when I’m in the area.
Pat and Lynn are really lovely people, they do everything to make you feel at home and enjoy your stay. On our first morning we did not have any dollars yet, so they lent us some money to get on a bus to the city. They are both in for some good conversations when you like to, but they completely give you your privacy when you want it.
I cooked in the kitchen and did laundry while I was there. If you are considering staying with Laura, do it! You won't regret it.
Even though he had small to no notice we were booking that night he accommodated us and everything was more than perfect! Such a cool host and a experience me and my friends will cherish and remember forever!
Ken and Kurt are the perfect hosts and such lovely people we really felt at home with them. Thank you Ken and Kurt we shall certainly come back to your place when we return!
We had a great time at Scott's place. The room was very thoughtfully arranged with some snacks, coffee, beverages and local tips. There was an echo dot installed there which responded to voice commands like 'lights on and off' or 'play some jazz music'.
Arthur Paddick was a very responsive and helpful host from booking through to check out. Highly recommended!
Their home is in a beautiful and very safe vicinity . Our rooms and bathroom were spotlessly clean. I would definitely recommend them to my friend and would stay with them again.
:) Fantastic location, stylish loft, gracious hostess! It’s a very comfortable space and was perfect for our girls weekend.
We walked everywhere and parked our car in the sterling garage a block behind our building. I loved the loft room with its lovely linens, comfy bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light. The bathroom is fantastic...and filled with every small amenity you could ever need.
The space has everything you’ll need and Tiana is super hospitable! It was an absolute delight!
My father was so satisfied that while staying there he booked another trip to stay at the cottage for 7 nights. Jeremy Johnson
What a gem of a place! Our hosts graciously let us check in early and stow our luggage due to a red eye flight. So kind.
Check in was easy, the place was spotless and very well thought out. The bathroom is a spot cozy, but again very clean and a great place to stay! Location is perfect for walking down to the waterfront.
GREAT Location. The pictures do not do this space justice, not to mention the good vibes too. It is much bigger than I imagined, and had everything we needed.
I highly recommend a stay at her place. I had a great night sleep and will stay there again next time I am in town.
The love of my life and  sweetheart Was so happy to stay there. It’s perfectly located, minutes from the beach, and all the shops and restaurants. We enjoyed it so much we plan to book more stays starting next month.
I have to mention the good quality of the bed;)! Shelton Gill was a charming host. I was flabbergasted at the size and  how extremely beautifull her decore was.
The absolute best AirBNB/hotel experience I’ve ever had. The topographic point is beautiful. It is small - but a perfect size for one person or a couple.
The apartment is well decorated and clean. Easy to reach. For us the most important things: the beds are very comfortable and the shower is perfect.
Yes. But it's called the tiny house! any bigger, and it might lose the charm.
Her topographical point is absolutely adorable and very comfortable. She greeted me at my arrival to show me around and answer any question . She was very warm and welcoming.
My husband and I traveled with our two small kids (6 and 2) but I also think this would be a perfect spot for a single traveler or a couple looking for a quick getaway. My favorite part about his home was definitely location. It's a 1-2 minute walk to the beach, and I had an awesome time running alongside the shore early in the morning.
The space was so cute, she is very thoughtful and creative with the decorations and lots of attention to detail to make the space as comfortable as possible for guests. Bed was super comfortable, great pillows, slept wonderfully at night due to quiet atmosphere. It's a charming old house.
Scott is a great host who has gone above and beyond to create a great experience for his guests. As a working professional I also enjoyed the privacy and quietness that the room provided when a good nights sleep was needed. The ocean views did not hurt either!!
The room is cozy and gorgeous. Plus there's the adjacent sitting room for extra space. The bathroom is gorgeous; a huge skylight overlooking the city, and lovely custom tiled shower.
The bed was wonderfully comfortable, full cable tv and a large and well-equipped bathroom. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Marc accommodated our late arrival and met us personally to show us around the space and answer any questions that we had.
Staying at Paul’s was amazing. Paul kept the place super clean and fresh, we were really comfortable. There were extras of everything we could possibly need in the room and the bed was really comfortable.
The bed in the main bedroom is comfy. The bathroom is the only space that feels small but it’s not a large deal. The location is a short drive from several museums although it’s far away from shop and restaurants.
We ate breakfast there (when it didn’t rain)and drink wine on the  Sofa like an extended living room under the moonlight during evening with fantastic sound of Jodi Stallings music collection . We had fun and laughed a lot with Alejandrina Anderson especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . He is a very cool , accommodating and friendly person.Likewise his son Todd  who lives on the third floor helped us on our arrival carry up our heavy luggage , and Alejandrina Anderson got up so early to help us carry down our bag on our departure day.
Crystal Romero and Maxim are awesome host , I was blown away  I was blown away For my stay  it was my first time staying airbnb plus. I’m happy to say th i’m happy to say where very  comfortable and well rested. So my mom first time using Airbnb with me  he was blown away on how good it was to be able to get a such a Nich place.
Her topographic point is very well located, very stylish and clean! I would love to come back some day!
The space was bright and airy while being a cozy nook all at the same time, the plethora of blankets and pillows was amazing. We were greeted with a personalized message at the front door which was a lovely touch, and Jeanna was exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!
The front garden is charming and the cottage is so nicely decorated and appointed. It would have been nice to have a couch to stretch out on. I totally get it about no tv - there’s adequate to do outside that you don’t need indoor entertainment.
I was there during a heat wave and while there's no air conditioning, fans kept the rooms cool. The neighboring streets are delightful, the decor in Susan and Thomas George’s lovely suite is perfect, but what takes this place above and beyond the norm are the thoughtful touches Susan has added for each moment. From earplug , water and caramels by the bed, ( both sides!!)
The whole building was super clean, comfortable, stylish, and safe. We would love to stay here again following time we’re in Chicago.
We would highly recommend Ben and Michael's B&B as a place to stay. They have books maps and guides available as well. The apartment is a cosy upper level with stylish bedroom, intimate living room with small kitchenette with microwave and small refrigerator.
The space is furnished and decorated beautifully. We were there to enjoy the beach as much as we could, and Arthur Paddick made certain we had everything we desired for our beach excursions. He even brought us ice packs and tray so we can pack up the cooler.
I loved the personalized welcome and quick responses whenever we had a question, as well. We enjoyed our stay at Stephanie's apartment. The location was perfect for us as we come to Tacoma to visit family in the Proctor area, a short drive away.
The bed is extremely comfy. I would definitely recommend.
There is large TV, coffee machine, clean robes, slippers, and even a bottle of aspirin provided. Would highly recommend Tyler's place and would definitely love to stay here again next time we're in San Francisco.
My boyfriend and I had zero complaints about staying here and were sad to leave! It was also wonderful being so close to Point Defiance, we went to Anthony’s (4 minute drive) right next to the park and had great seafood with a beautiful view, and went for a beautiful hike on a different day. I think it would be hard to find a better place to stay in Tacoma!
I love waking up to the water and mountain views! Thanks, Jerry and Julie; your house was pretty much perfect!
Shelton Gill is the hostess with the mostest! I have dietary allergies, and Shelton Gill made sure to tailor breakfast with my allergies in mind - she is a very kind person and a generous hostess. Shelton Gill is very knowledgeable about  local activities and has great suggestions if you want to do some site seeing.
Thank you so much for allowing us to stay extra night!! Your place are so relaxing and perfect for stress-free mini vacation! For anyone you who planning on going to Chicago!
Basically anything we will need during our stay. I will definitely stay here again the following time! Thank you again!
We felt we could relax and didn’t feel obligated to interact...we just chose to do so. I would recommend their place to family and friends when staying in Tacoma. We were super happy with it.
Super convenient. We loved the notes that were placed around the space, made everything really easy to locate and use. The entire set up really helped us feel like we were in a home away from home.
Angela was super apologetic about the light construction happening next door, but there's nothing she could have done about that. Angela was extremely friendly and welcoming. The topographic point was so cozy, clean, and perfect for two people.
Finally regarding the location you cant beat it. Overall great value for the cost and beautiful place. If I’m ever in LA again and not staying with my in-laws I would definitely stay at his place again.
The room is HUGE, super clean, and comfy bed. Bathroom and closet space were also a large plus. We will definitely be back!
The perfekt Airbnb Experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We felt very comfortable with Crystal Romero. just beautiful. We would definitely go back to Crystal Romero.
Jodi Stallings's townhome consists of renovated "apartments"- ours had two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a little kitchenette and dining area. Christopher Brown place was outstanding. Super cute, stylish, and clean.
Joan Litwin's master suite is a FANTASTIC place to stay in the city. Close to UCSF, public transportation system and a wide assortment of restaurants and shops between seventh and 9th Avenue in the Inner Sunset district. Check in/out was a breeze and Joan Litwin is highly responsive.
So very accessible into the city...  And a hop on the LIE for a drive to Long Island. Whether it's for business or pleasure, Maggie's place is PERFECT. I will be back again and hope it is available!
It's my first time in New York, everything went well. The house was very nice. It was well prepared and clean.
The little touches like sticky tape, and scissors, even down to great clothes hangers that have material so your clothes stay on them! I will definitely be missing not only the great place but the beautiful people as well!
I highly recommend a stay at her place. I had a great night sleep and will stay there again following time I am in town.
If you’re looking at this place, book it!!! The rooms are super cunning . The house is adorable.
It’s light, very well equipped and has a lovely little seating area looking out at a sweet garden. However, the real surprise was the lovely shops just a tiny walk away which we just loved! We could have spent all our time just there!
Breakfast was delicious, and thoughtfully prepared. I would have liked to stay for a week. The house is easy to find right off the main road, but print the driving directions out, as well as the address.
This is a small, but convenient apartment. Just what we needed for one night before we took our flights back home. It's very close to Redondo and Hermosa beach - we walked to both beaches the next morning.
Whatever you are looking for he will be able to help you find it. All of the recommendations he provided were first rate. When looking  for our accommodation in San Francisco there were so many choice , we are very glad we picked Tyler's place.
My family came from out of town to visit and we needed a place that accommodated 5 people with plenty of room and finding this place was a gem! Nina and Merv’s place was absolutely fabulous! We arrived earlier than expected and they were very kind to let us come ahead to the place.
The neighborhood is beautiful. It was clean, nicely decorated, and Paul did an awesome job of including anything you could possibly need in the space. Out of the week we spent hopping around California, this was my favorite bed.
A short walk to the marina, beaches and close to Whole Foods and lots of food options. Great host - Angela is fantastic.
The house is in a quite vicinity . Whole Food is only a few hounded feet away. We walked on the pier almost everyday, listened to the wave and watched the dolphin jumping.
The location is outstanding - good area, quite place, private parking and close all places of interests. Very clean. You will feel like home.
The room is very wide , bed is incredibly comfortable , bathroom is immaculate , and there is parking on premises. Excellent! Thank you!
Wonderful place to stay! After spending the 4 nights before in an apartment, a tent and a hotel... it was great to spread out here and relax! Great location with easy distance to tons of restaurants & activities.
They provided: body wash, shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, an iron, and a first aid kit. The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. The tv also has an amazon fire stick and the WiFi was strong.
Don't think twice,  just BOOK IT. My husband and I whizzed all around the state of Washington and were happy to come "home" every night. We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the snacks Bob and Sharann left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen.
Linda greeted us and I immediately felt at home. She gave us "the tour" right away and very thoroughly. Lovely accommodations for my adult daughter and myself (we need separate bedrooms!)
The highlight of our trip was riding her two new bikes up the coast to Santa Monica...what a great day we had! We never used our car once. I can’t recommend this place enough.
Angela's place has so many sweet touches, like light breakfast options, coffee, and bottled water. Her place was centrally located and we were able to walk to many places in the area, or grab a quick Uber ride. I would highly recommend Angela's place to anyone looking to stay in SF!
We enjoyed our stay w Ron and Laurie. The location was perfect—just steps away from the Fourth Ave Strip. The evening we arrived Laurie drove us on a brief tour of the area to point where (and where not) to eat.
There is a refrigerator, desk, tv, and travelers information about getting around San Francisco. Basically anything we will need during our stay. The topographic point was very clean, stylish, and homely.
There is also some fresh coffee and homemade granola to enjoy along with other thoughtful touches. But they kindly provide earplugs so if you bring an eye mask you’ll be all set! I would definitely stay with them again.
The house is in a quite neighborhood. A couple of neighborhood parks are close by. I can not say enough good things about Angela and the house.
If you get lucky and there is availability you must book a stay. Great location for beach and sightseeing in LA. Clean well kept cottage with everything we could have asked for on our stay.
Jerry & Julie have created a masterpiece with this home. The layout and design of the house is tailor-made for guests with families, or couples looking for a quiet retreat. The bedrooms have plenty of room, the bathrooms are spacious and the living room is cozy with a warm fireplace.
Chris & Tim's place was great for my week and half stay in the Virginia Beach Area. The bungalow is surrounded by beautiful trees and plants and there are many parks to explore in the area too. The cottage itself was very nice and had a nice homelike feeling to it.
We had a great stay at T’s this past weekend! The place was in a great location, she was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. My wife and I would definitely recommend to friends travelling to Redondo Beach.
The bed is under the eaves, so watch your head! The only reason we'd hesitate to stay again is that the bed was too soft for us, but everything else was lovely.
Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach. and borrow them. She also had good suggestion on local places to go, restaurants and pubs etc.
The check-in process was easy. The house was very clean. It’s very nice that it has a private parking space.
Great stay! Matthew An and Sharann’s topographic point is an excellent option for staying in the DuPont area. We were welcomed personally, and the suite included many personal touches that made it a very comfortable place to stay.
We were headed to San Diego for the next part of our trip and needed a quick laundry fix. She was very responsive and helpful the entire time. We highly recommend staying at her place and look forward to staying there again on our next visit.
The room is exactly as pictured and had loads of thoughtful touches and was a true home away from home. The apartment is a short walk away from bus stops that are about a 20 minute ride from downtown. We much preferred being out of the city and away from the bunco and bustle.
Instant smile when I arrived. The location was great and the privacy was perfect. The hosts were amazing at accommodating any needs I had and were always quick to respond if I had any questions.
Melia's place was outstanding! Stunning views right from the porch! Her place was sparkling clean with a ton of thoughtful touches and amenities.
:) We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.
My boyfriend and I stayed at the Little House for 2 nights, on President's Day weekend (also my birthday!). The house was ADORABLE and so so comfortable. We didn't get to visit with Francis Jones much,  but she was so sweet and hospitable, even from the sidelines.
His place is gorgeous & he includes MANY extras! The beach & stores were only blocks away, so it was a perfect walk each morning & I felt totally safe walking alone. I really wanted to ride a bike on the boardwalk, but didn't have time, so I guess I'll be back!
Maggie's townhome consists of renovated "apartments"- ours had two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a little kitchenette and dining area. The place was very nicely decorated and we had everything we needed, plenty of linens, towels, snacks and drinks! Our flight arrived at 9am so Maggie very graciously allowed us to drop our bags off in the morning before we headed in to the city.
The bikes are an awesome feature and made for a great day of hoping from boardwalk to boardwalk. Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the LA/beach front area. Redondo beach was a great spot, a little quietter spot - away from tons of tourists, but still not far from the more popular areas.
However, this ended up being something I loved. If you want a place that is peaceful and, to use the Airbnb descriptor - magical, you need to stay here. We loved the modern design and really cool efficient use of space and the tranquil garden setting.
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. Whoever coined the phrase, “location, location, location” must have had Tyler’s place in mind. Not only is it sparkling clean, this rental is stylishly appointed with a full sized stove, refrigerator, and oven which we found useful for heating up leftovers and making eggs in the morning.
Neva was out of town and asked person else to look after the house. Nova helped me meet my personal needs. The location is very convenient, only 10 minutes walking distance to Hermosa beach and close to restaurant and market.
A fantastic spot to relax during your time in Tacoma. We were very comfortable during our 10 night stay and hope to visit again!
He even had put out a personalized sign welcoming our group. Overall, Chuck was a very thoughtful host and I would recommend his place!
Tammy and Marc are great hosts who respected our privacy, and were quick to respond anytime we had a question. We would gladly stay here again!
Edwin Green and Luis Hawkins’s place was wonderful. Check in was easy and Luis Hawkins was very welcoming, telling us what was around the local area - he even brought us some milk! The apartment itself is lovely, clean and cosy - I don’t think the photograph do it justice.
My partner and I stayed in the in-law suite for 2 nights and felt very welcome from the moment we arrived. Ian and Tenzing have created a lovely space for visitors to stay in and ensured that privacy was maintained at all times. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the telly even had a Netflix subscription which was a really nice touch.
The mattress is very comfy, very firm (slept well even though I usually prefer a softer mattress) as is the rest of the room. Just really homey. The A/C works great, but the weather was nice enough (and the neighborhood safe enough) that most night I slept with the door open (there's a screen door to keep the bugs out) and the ceiling fan on.
This space is beautiful and private. Marianne has thought ahead to make the rooms welcoming and comfortable, well-stocked with anything you might need for your stay. There is a little market within walking distance with a lovely coffee shop (I love coffee - big bonus for us).
At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. I’m fairly certain that Angela is part angel. We arrived late on a Sunday night, about an hour later than planned due to a delayed flight.
The kitchen has the basics, including a two burner plug-in for cooking, and a nice long counter for all your stuff. The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long skinny window to see out to the BBQ area. The porch has a table and chairs for outside eating or two other chairs for lounging.
Erik Dickson's house is very spacious; two decent sized bedroom and full baths, great full kitchen (I made Thanksgiving dinner for our family here! ), good sized living area. Very clean.
They were very helpful with advice on transportation and food, and great for a general chat as well. Staying with Jackie and Christian was more fun and comfortable than I expected! They shared their local knowledge, homemade bread, common space, and activity recommendations.
There are 2 bathrooms: the bathroom on the second floor is mostly shared by you and the other AirBNB room, and the bathroom on the first floor is mostly used by May, but you're allowed to use it too (and it has a cool Japanese toilet!) The attic actually has more floor space than the main room, but you have to duck down a bit while walking around. The main room has a private balcony attached.
The main room has a private balcony attached. Both rooms have their own AC units. Again, May and Arthur Paddick are terrific host .
Peg and Jeff’s place was fantastic . It was fully equipped - Peg and Jeff have thought of everything, including snacks. The area was great - quiet and relaxing but with some nice restaurants nearby and close to public transportation, and the Debra Dibble and Mission districts.
The house was so amazingly clean and the host are so sweet and thoughtful. It was pouring raining and they gave me an umbrella. I needed to steam my clothes and they provided me with a steamer.
There was also a drawer full of travel-sized hygienic products if you happened to forget anything. My favorite part of the place was the mini library that included a slew of books on San Francisco. There was also a guestbook that provided you with all the info you needed to know while staying there as well as recommendations on restaurants and things to do in the area.
Paul’s place is one of my favorite Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. The location was perfect, easy walk to the beach and pier. The space was very clean, bright & comfortable.
First time Airbnb'er here..  Janet Luckman's place was exactly what i was looking for.. I would highly recommend staying at this Air BnB! Janet Luckman was a great host; very communicative!
Requested for some fire log on our last night to set a little fire outside the house, and George was so fast in helping us to set it up after hearing our request, he even went ahead & hang some pretty lights outside for us, really makes us feel so happy! Would love to stay at George & Colleen’s place again if we have the chance to!
There's a great Italian restaurant around the corner from him if you want some grub and then come back and relax in the nicely decorated place. Sheri Vowell was very accommodating. She rearranged her schedule to be home for our midday arrival.
! Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself!
Elizabeth’s home is beautiful, not to mention, spotless clean! A great, quiet bedroom just a few blocks from the beach. Stayed a night with my wife for a wedding at the historic Redondo Beach library, and we were able to walk to the venue within ten minutes.
Staying with Elizabeth was great. The room we had was enormous and the bed was heavinly. The shower was amazing and big.
She even had beach towels, beach umbrella and anything else you may need for a trip to the beach. Angela’s place may be the cutest air BnB we have stayed at to date. Angela is warm and welcoming and was very accommodating of our arrival time.
We really enjoyed our stay at Michael Krieg's. We especially loved the bed and duvet which are super comfortable and the bathroom is great. It takes about 45 mins to get into downtown but there are transport links close by and Michael Krieg is very helpful and offered to give us a few rides to the nearby metro station.
I can recommend this place with all my heart. Check in and out was super easy and so was the communication with the host. Beach is in walking distance and the neighborhood is really nice.
The apartment is a cosy upper level with stylish bedroom, intimate living room with small kitchenette with microwave and small refrigerator. The place was beautiful had a lot of natural light and comfortable ambiance. It was in a good location with easy access to San francisco and points north.
Jeanna's place was absolute perfection. The space was cozy and a wonderful home away from home. My husband and I brought our 9 month old son with us and even with the stairs it was perfect; an attached baby gate was provided at the top of the stairs so no tumbles were possible.
It also has a balcony that shows a view of all of Tacoma. On some days we can see Mt. Rainier from a far and that is a sight for sensitive eyes!
It was so wonderful to have a chance to stay with Zeena again... and a great way to introduce my husband to Airbnb! Zeena is an amazing and thoughtful host. The accommodations are inviting and warm from the moment you enter her home.
Shopping is close by at Bay Street in Emeryville or 4th street in Berkeley (all of which Crystal Romero has laid out in a convenient welcome book) Easy to get into SF by the Bart at the Fruitvale station. My parents and I stayed at George & Colleen's place for a few days while visiting San Francisco and had an amazing time. The location of their place was very convenient; everyday we drove about 10 minutes to the Ferry station and just took that to get downtown.
Supermarkets, nice cafe and restaurants are also nearby and you really don't need a car to explore everything. The whole package is 1+++. What can I say about heather... she is really a ace host !!!!!!!
We were thrilled to have found such a beautiful home to stay at near most of our favorite places and in a clean and quiet neighborhood! Who wouldn’t like that?) and enhanced the stay for us.
Was able to walk or take a quick Uber ride to where ever we needed to go. Elizabeth's home is beautiful and walking distance to the beach! The room and private bath are spacious and the bed is beyond comfortable.
Bonus for all the extra linens, iron and ironing board, and bedding. Shantell Preusser was very accommodating to our late arrival after a long day of airplane travel.
Plenty of sheets and pillows. Would definitely recommend if you don't mind staying a bit farther out - it's still really only around 5-10 dollar uber/lyft ride back.
Everything was found just as described. Elisabeth is super nice and lovely to talk to. She makes sure everything is on point.
The location allowed us to easily reach Manhattan by subway. Being able to do laundry is always a great perk when traveling for several weeks. The host was quick to respond to our questions.
Lots of beach toys available on site to use. The place was well decorated and exceptionally clean! We did not have one clutch and our stay was most enjoyable!
Perfect place to stay in SF. Beautiful room, sparkling clean and large shower with immediate hot water, comfortable bed with high-quality linens, public transportation easily available, close to several coffee shops and delectable bakeries, easy walk to Golden Gate Park, close to Safeway, and immediate response from Edward Ramsey to any request. The view from the multiple back windows was of a exuberant garden, which made a relaxing spot to read or have a glass of wine.
Angela's place was absolutely outstanding. Communication was excellent and she is a very thoughtful and generous host. We were visiting for our 10th wedding anniversary and she made our stay extra special with many thoughtful touches.
The mattress is very comfy, very firm (slept well even though I usually prefer a softer mattress) as is the rest of the room. Just really homey. The A/C works great, but the weather was nice enough (and the neighborhood safe enough) that most nights I slept with the door open (there's a screen door to keep the bugs out) and the ceiling fan on.
Cottage is larger than it appears in photos and has a lovely private patio with seating. Kitchen is stocked with cookware, spices, cooking oil, a few staples, and breakfast items which made mealtime easy and economical. Walk out of the cottage in any direction and there are things to do and lovely residential neighborhoods to stroll.
Absolutely fantastic location. Literally 2 blocks from the beach. And Paul had a couple of beach cruisers that he let us use as part of our reservation!
There is an keyless entry to the apartment. 2 blocks away. There are many topographic point around where you can have pretty decent meals and a pub where you can have a drink at night.
They provided me everything I could have asked for, including the most amazing coffee (and cream and sugar) and tea and cookies. They even checked in with me throughout my stay to see if there was anything I needed, or if they could pick up anything at Whole Foods for me while they were out. I felt very taken care of!
This place was great! Amazing position and perfect for snuggling! We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, snacks, water, and a fridge.
Neva's guesthouse was very comfortable and cozy with a nice patio area outside.The description of her place was very accurate,the guesthouse is small but had good amenities and was well organized with a large closet to store our luggage .Parking was very convenient on a quiet street just off the PCH so there was lots of restaurants and easy access to airport and other LA areas. Neva’s place was lovely! It was clean, cozy, and perfect for my stay.
He is so adorable and I had a lovely time playing with him even though I am not an animal lover and a small paranoid around pets. To sum it up,  the place felt like home and we would love to come and stay here whenever we are back at Chicago :)
The location of the guest house was super close to both Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, as well as a nearby strip mall with Whole Foods and Paris Baguette. Bennie Dudgeon was super apologetic about the light construction happening next door, but there's nothing she could have done about that. It didn't really bother us in the least.
Thomas George very nicely baked up some blueberry muffins, ahh they were amazing I wish we could have some more now  All in all it was one of our favorite Air B&B's visting America. We stayed far out from San Francisco City because the monetary value were so high, it depends on what you you want to do in the city. We don't regret booking our from the city.
The house is well decorated and close to JF Kennedy airport, just 20 min drive. Free parking is available by roadside nearby. We had a room upstairs with a cute loft, which is especially great for a family with child , though we didn’t use it.
The Host was amazing. Used the bikes and grill. Has all you need and if you need anything the host will provide.
Perfect for what we needed. Great stay! Elizabeth sent me a message detailing the check in process which was very easy to follow.
I can’t rave enough! Tyler sent us a list of recommendations when we asked which were super helpful. We’d definitely stay here again if we come back to San Francisco!
Neva was an excellent host -- very accommodating and responded quickly to any questions. We had a wonderful time!
Chuck and his dog Charlotte are so welcoming!! There were seven of us in total who stayed there for six nights. No crabbiness here!
An awesome Airbnb experience....our stay at Igor's place was great in every way. Our stay there could not have gone better....highly recommend!
Michael thinks of everything, anticipating his guests' every need. He even had extra tooth brushes, so a forgetful old man (me) would have one. His spacious loft is furnished with lovely vintage items, including many of his own works, all arranged in a pleasing, artful fashion.
The biggest plus was the cardinal location of the home. We would HIGHLY recommend this home to anyone staying in San Francisco.
I was made to feel completely at home, being offered a bath with some yummy bath salts, and full access to her gorgeous kitchen and everything it had to offer. I had never seen that before, but it was the best thing for a cozy stay. Thank you, Christina, for the heart and soul you brought to the AirBnB!
My wife and I spent 4 days at Tyler’s Airbnb and enjoyed every minute of it. Tyler’s Airbnb is conveniently located in the west side of the city and is just a couple blocks from the beach where we got to see some amazing sunset . There’s tons of places to eat and grab coffee, just a few blocks from the house.
Elizabeth is warm and welcoming (and fluent in both English and Spanish). Open the sliding glass doors to enjoy the sea breeze. I hope to return soon.
What a lovely experience staying at Jeremy Johnson cottage. My brother and I were visiting Tacoma for a business trip. I don't have adequate words to describe how wonderful Thomas George was.
Nala's place is absolutely perfect. Especially loved the bamboo shades to block out the street lamps. - Amenities are spot on.
Best airbnb EVER ! We highly recommend the topographic point and we will come back for sure ! Bisous from France !
The apartment was spotless, and absolutely every detail had been thought of including fresh pastries from an independent coffee shop and breakfast items to make it easy for those needing to grab something as they walk out the door. Check out Rosewood Cafe on your manner for a casual but yummy meal! Thanks, Susan.
We enjoyed our stay at Rod's place! The location worked well. Not far from the subway, walking distance to many attractions, and several restaurants and convenience stores right there in case we needed something.
We visited San Francisco on our honeymoon and weren't  sure what to expect since neither one of us had ever been to the west coast. The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. Mishaa was flexible with our check-in/ check out times when we had a delayed flight in and an early flight out.
Absolutely perfect for my needs. (Damn... gonna be difficult for me to get a booking now after this reappraisal . )
She is an exceptional decorator; the place exudes warmth and character. We had an great experience! Check in was easy and the cottage is clean, spacious, and welcoming.
Incredible design, and extremely comfortable. The electric fireplace was so cute and made it very cozy :) Thank you Michael Krieg and Shelton Gill!! !
We have family in the area who live in a small apartment so we just needed a place to sleep. This suite was perfect for us, and we will probably book again on our next visit.
Cher Alexander and Bennie Dudgeon were fantastic hosts right from when we booked several months ago. Travelling from the house to bus to BART is no problem, but the area of 40th and San Pablo (local grocery store) had a host of unsavoury characters. Target is a much cleaner, safer option.
The outdoor terrace is perfect for a morning coffee or breakfast and the pool right next to it is the place to be in the afternoons. The view toward the garden in the back of the house is  amazing and the whole ambience is very peaceful. Nina has thoughtfully provided all necessary dinnerware, towels for the pool and also juices, cereal boxes and other things for breakfast and snacking.
Along with fresh flowers, she left a basket of snacks (breakfast bars, cereal, oatmeal, chips and cookies), and a special dark chocolate orange treat. The space is bright, warm and comfortable. The location can’t be beat (coffee shops, restaurants and grocery stores nearby), with a great view of Commencement Bay.
I left her house each day and walked to all my destinations (although ambitious, it can totally be done from this location). She was friendly and went the extra mile to make sure all the technicalities were in place, and I found the small bed to be comfortable because I slept like a rock! Would totally recommend.
Everything is as described on the web page . I was only here 1 night but would definitely return if it was available again. Actually tried to come back on my return to SF but sadly it was already booked.
The home is very clean and meticulous. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying again.
Onsite parking so you don't have to deal with hunting for on-street parking. Luxury hotel accommodations without the hotel monetary value and hassle.
There were many amenities thrown in and water in the electric refrigerator . Very close to beach. We will definitely be back.
I recently stayed at the Private Cozy Cottage a second time, from Jan 30th to Feb 6th. And I was not disappointed at all. Heather really knows how to take care of her guests.
The apartment is very fresh and clean. There is a wonderful garden which is an oasis of peace in the busy city of Chicago. The location is great, only a 5 to 10 minute walk from Division & Milwaukee CTA metro station.
This topographic point is awesome. Small? Yes.
Each bathroom was large with large, fluffy towels, shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash. The kitchen is nicely appointed, there are plenty of games and movies available, and there is even a great outdoor living space! And the views - beautiful!!
Jesus's place was lovely. Everything was clean, functional, and well thought-out. The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head.
The casita is small but has everything you could want for a comfortable stay. I love to cook and had asked Melia for certain spices which she kindly, and without hesitation, supplied. Communication from the beginning was outstanding, every single question I had was answered promptly and with additional helpful information.
She has done a fantastic job making sure no detail is forgotten. This cozy, colorful, clean room is just the place in which to relax. Every amenity has been thought of including extra pillows, TV, reading lamps for everyone, tissues for all, hair dryer, even things like toothbrushes and makeup remover!
We absolutely loved your topographic point . Your blankets and sheets were clean and soft and your pillows were the best we’ve ever slept on. You have really created a beautiful space for your guests.
I highly recommend a stay here! Again... "beach cruisers"!
So many nice touches like Lori Stewart homemade granola,  Desperation Snacking Noodles (free ramen with beautiful bowls to eat out of),  great coffee and tea selections, desk with great view of backyard, nice selection of books (if you have time for reading), lots of bathroom essentials (loved having the makeup/face wipes and hand lotion) and everything was so clean and bright! Ben and John Mullins’s air bnb was prime location  - about a 15 min drive from the city with many restaurants and coffee (Philz included!) close by, which we loved.
The room is HUGE, super clean, and comfy bed. Bathroom and closet space were also a big plus. We will definitely be back!
The apartment is a short walk away from bus stops that are about a 20 minute ride from downtown. Francis Jones himself is very accommodating and gave us loads of useful tips on our first day of how to get around, useful apps and even gave us great recommendations for what we should do on our first day. (Which we decided to do and ended up being our favourite day in San Francisco).
We briefly met Neva when arriving, she is friendly and nice. The place had a nice cooling unit, and the room felt so big and comfy, the rain  shower felt awesome and the patio is beautiful and nice to hang out on. Only a few minute drive to the beach.
I typically stay in the same hotel each time I visit the East Bay for work. The scene was picturesque (imagine lemon trees, tropical flowers and humming birds each morning). The actual guest room is even better in person than the beautiful pics online.
Susan does so many lovely things for her guests. All the things you want - good communication, easy check in and out, convenient parking, a beautiful and comfortable space to call "home" for awhile. But to all this she adds plush robes and slippers, loads of fluffy towels, television and streaming channel options, and shelves of books if you'd like to explore something you haven't before.
The unit was super clean, decor was lovely, and had everything I needed. Joelle is an AMAZING host. Honestly, she went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was as best as it could have been.
The location is great. The complimentary snacks were also a very nice touch. Our friends that were staying at a different Airbnb stopped by for a few minutes and they were upset they didnt book this first.
The kitchen is to die for. This is the perfect house for entertaining as we found out when we hosted a bbq the day after my son’s wedding. The large amount of people were split between inside the house and outside near the bbq food truck we had.
Crystal Romero provides all the amenities one could possibly need and the house is superbly clean. You can count on Zeena to make your stay wonderful. Her home is immaculately clean, the room is spotless, and the linens and towels are sanitized before each guest.
When we were there, the temp outside was like 31 degree . But the AC in the home (1 in each room) is cold enough to make it super comfortable in the WHOLD area. There were snacks for us, beers, pop, prepared for us.
Arthur Paddick’s place was spotless upon arrival and had everything we needed to enjoy eating in and cooking when we wanted to. Lovely and recently renovated home in the Outer Sunset -- just a few blocks away from the beach + one of the best "hot" restaurants in SF (Outerlands). Arthur Paddick is easy to communicate with and his place is exceptionally clean, well-decorated and has a new, very comfortable mattress.
We appreciated everything about our stay. Thank you again!
She also had a few snacks and coffee which helped us a lot and was very convenient! Neva's place was my favorite air bnb, ever. It was sparkling clean, even more lovely than the pictures, and the renovated bathroom (esp the shower) was stunning.
It was a short few minute walk to the beach and it was so nice to have a dedicated parking spot. Book it! You won’t be disappointed.
Room was the best. So spacious. Tons of floor and cabinet space.
We arrived a bit earlier than expected and my phone failed to send the ETA message to Sierra but she let us drop our things off and freshen up which was deeply appreciated. We Lyfted to San Francisco which was a bit pricey but upon discussion with our driver found out we probably should've taken the public transportation. Despite that decision, we loved the location.
Paul’s place was perfect for our stay. It is located very close to adorable shops and restaurants. There was bottled water, coffee, and tea which was wonderful .
I discovered it last spring when I came up for my daughter's Lacrosse games. The bungalow is beautifully decorated. It is restful, quiet, and so comfortable.
This was our second stay at Joseph Lewis’s place. We love the radiant heat floors and the broad shower in the bathroom. We usually just have breakfast  in the apartment, but there are full-size, top-end appliances if one wished to cook.
walking into the space immediately put me at ease. you might need,  including bath robes! there's the cutest private garden right outside the backdoor, perfect for lounging in the morning with a cup of tea or at night near the outdoor fire pit with a glass of wine.
Neighborhood was quiet. My favorite part of my stay is that Neva had small amenities (q-tips, cetaphil face wash, sunblock, aloe vera, coffee, notepad and pen). material you might need but never think of.
The room and private bath are spacious and the bed is beyond comfortable. The balcony is perfect for reading in the fresh sunshine. I felt incredibly safe and had an amazing weekend stay.
We had a very rainy and cold day while I was visiting. My daughter and I got food. She came over and we had a very cozy afternoon of studying and reading.
Paul’s guest house is wonderful! We did however make good use of the beach chairs, which we very much appreciated! Paul was very quick to respond to all messages and gave us some great recommendations!
Michael, Capra and Vyla are a wonderful host family! They really make you feel welcome... I stayed in the vintage time capsule for 3 months with no issues.
Book this place now! Thank you Marcia for your amazing hospitality.
The cottage is a delightlful unit in a quiet residential neighborhood that is convenient to major streets and restaurants. Heather cares about her guests and seems to continuously improve the experience. She will give you lots of information when you arrive.
This place was perfect and priced extremely well! Both amazing places!! Highly recommend this topographic point you will not be disappointed!!
The breakfast items that were available to us, plus the bottled water, were very much appreciated. I hope to stay at Chris's topographic point when I am next in SF.
The place was extremely neat, with fresh towels and linen provided, along with all the bathroom essentials. Tyler's place is super close to the N line of the Muni, so it is very easy to get to downtown using public transport, and explore the city. There are also a few restaurants and cafes close by and the beach is just a few blocks down, along with the Golden Gate Park.
The biggest plus was the free parking. All things were accessible by Uber in 5 minutes or so. ~20 Uber ride to downtown.
The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.) Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask. But otherwise, I completely recommend this place.
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Chris and Tim's cottage. We had the whole place to ourselves with free parking and access to all things beach going (towels, chairs, bikes, etc). The cottage itself was decorated in a most beautiful and artistic way.
The home was so bright and cheerful, and the kitchen had all the comforts and then some for those that are super inspired to cook for themselves. Quiet neighborhood and within walking distance for basic needs and amenities. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the instructions for the guidelines to honor within her home were very clear and simple.
Jodi Stallings’s topographic point was just perfect for my trip to Hermosa Beach. The bed was very comfortable and had nice linens. There were more than adequate towels and the bathroom is done very nicely with great water pressure!
Amazing getaway in the sunshine with so many happy plant ! I loved this simple and calm space. We had a great experience; highlights include enjoying a cold beer in the sunshine at the picnic table and saving my outdoor showers for the afternoon when the sun was brightest.
Ceiling fans helped cool things down in the evening and helped to make a good nights sleep. The neighborhood is transitional as described but the 5 days we were there we did not have any perturbation from the neighbors and nothing in the vicinity caused us a problem or gave us concern. Great location to get to downtown Seattle or Tacoma and not a bad drive to Rainier or Olympic National Parks.
It's close to several beaches as well as plenty of restaurants and businesses. Elizabeth was a fantastic host. The room was perfect, instructions clear, and it was super easy to check in and out.
She let us use her bikes to get to Hermosa Beach as well as downtown Redondo, which made our stay even more enjoyable! If we didn’t live on the East coast I would stay here more often. She is great and very enjoyable to work with.
Elizabeth's place is very nice and cozy. The room is huge and well equipped (TV, walking closet, shower, cabinet , etc.). Elizabeth was very nice and really reactive.
It is close to Shore Drive, but yet seems very private, thanks to a beautiful garden area. There is even an outdoor shower and all sorts of beach items for guests to use. If we needed anything excess during our stay, we could just ask.
(Which I prefer. Good size kitchen and dining area. No cooking, but there is a microwave.
We loved the thoughtful things like coffee, some bottles of water, nice fluffy towels and really comfy bed! We had an amazing trip and this place definitely helped. So great, we would definitely stay again.
The cottage is well appointed and efficient. For me, proximity to the beach and within walking distance to a vibrant commercial district w/ cafes and restaurant was the best.
The cottage was very clean, all amenities were available and useable, and the serenity was very appreciated. Awesome job with a book of "things to do" to include restaurants and places to see. Any request made was met with immediate action and assistance.
Thank you, Chuck and Charlotte, for providing your amazing home as a wedding venue. All of our guests commented on this unique and stunning property which allowed both intimacy and plenty of space to spread out. The accommodations were comfortable and we enjoyed the eye candy of lake views from the expansive living room windows.
Great food & drinks & several theater within 3 blocks in any direction. The neighborhood is on the upswing and there are so many cool antique shops and small businesses everywhere. Very friendly folks.
This was the first time we have stayed in a host’s home so we were a bit nervous about it but Edward Ramsey made us feel completely comfortable and welcome in his home. The room is exactly as pictured and had loads of thoughtful touches and was a true home away from home. The bed was super comfortable and we slept peacefully every night.
A huge plus was the bed! 我們於跨新年的半夜入住,抵達時候剛好遇到Arnold Jackson主人,替我們簡單介紹房間使用｡房間跟照片看起來ㄧ模一樣,位於二樓,浴室就在房間旁邊,睡眠品質非常好,床好睡,沒有噪音｡一樓進門是客廳及廚房,很美麗的佈置及擺設,我們只能停留短暫的一天覺得很可惜｡停車就停在房子外面路邊位置蠻多,離機場開車25分鐘｡住宿附近感覺是很清靜的鎮靠近海邊,悠閒的步調,因為時間緊湊離開前特地繞去看了附近的海灘也很美｡住宿位置很好,環境好,滿分的一次體驗｡We stay after new year  (We have flight next day . location is close to airport about 25mins driving ) When we arrived we met the owner Arnold Jackson she is very kindly and introduced about the room to us.Room and bathroom was clean and beautiful.
Robert Huckabaa and Sharann were perfect hosts. The room is private with its own bathroom. it’s so much better than staying in a hotel room.
Brent is very responsive and available to provide any help and answer any questions. To top it off, her communication was perfect. She messaged a couple days prior to update us on our early check in request, checked in with us after we arrived to make certain we were able to settle in and to see if we needed anything.
You can also walk to Laurel shopping district for a bite to eat and other shopping needs. This was our first major stop after a long flight from Australia and we couldn’t have felt more at home! The accommodation is in a great location, close to shop and attractions and in a safe and secure part of Oakland.
Gregory Simons and Lenora have a beautiful, quiet, and spotlessly clean home, and a lovely garden. They are excellent hosts World Health Organization are kind, considerate, and thoughtful. The comfort of guests is their top priority.
Communication was great and check-in was a breeze! Instructions for everything were easy to follow and refer back to! There were sooo many thoughtful touches that really made this Airbnb EXTRA.
Lovely home a short walk from Redondo Beach (access via Torrance Blvd). Checking in and out was super easy as both the outside door and the bedroom door have codes--I received an email with detailed instructions ahead of time. Elizabeth was friendly and communicative through text message and offered us coffee from the Keurig.
This is the second time I have stayed at Paul's lovely place and everything was just as perfect as it was on my first visit. Paul allowed me to check in early so I could enjoy a ride on one of the complimentary beach bikes which was just what I needed after my long flight. I will definitely be back!
It has such fun style and great layout for solo or couples traveling. My girlfriend and I had just come off a week long bike ride/camping/party trip with the company work for through Napa Valley. We were in need of some quite time and relaxing.
Michael thinks of everything, anticipating his guests' every need. In addition to being a great host, Michael is a wonderful human being and delightful raconteur. We had coffee with him both mornings of our stay, and by the second day he was already like family.
The home is located in a nice quiet residential area and there is plenty of street car parking for those renting a car. Definitely check out Standard Fare for breakfast and lunch. Nina checked up on us a few times to make sure everything was going well which we loved.
Loved the quaint and comfortable home! Super easy check in process and comfortable to sleep! Sheets were actually amazing!
While in town I also went to the Olympus women’s spa located 15 minutes away and Southern Kitchen which is down the street. A great last minute option.
We were so pleased with everything else, we would forfeit those for what we did have. It was extremely clean and we had shampoo and soap (also important to us). The towels were plenty for us and grateful for an extra one just in case we needed it.
This is a lovely, placid , very clean room in a quiet vicinity of Berkeley. Grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are also within walking distance. I had to make a short occupation -related trip to UC Berkeley and this place was perfect for getting some work done in the evening.
We had more than enough space and the entire lot is very private with a beautiful backyard if you want to take a few moments to observe nature. We both felt super comfortable and Brian Burns responded immediately to our questions when we checked in. The cherry on top were the 2 bikes included next to the house which we used the entire weekend.
I booked it right away without any issues. It can perfectly fit up to 3 people. It also has one of cool showers I’ve ever seen In a home.
Not sure what renting bikes elsewhere would have costed but the ease of use with these and being able to ride them everywhere back and forth made the trip that much better. This place is so great. The space itself is very nice and comfortable and is in the center of everything.
The hosts have also gone out of their way to provide local tourist information, some games and toys for children, and an assortment of DVDs. Terrific experience overall!
Would totally recommend. Robert Huckabaa is a nice, clean and cosy little room in a lively area of san francisco. I was cordially received and hosted from her during the whole stay.
I enjoyed my stay. You will be spoiled here. If you want to stay in the queens area I recommend this spot.
She was very informative and responsive when we had questions prior to the trip. It was such a weight off our shoulders knowing we were in a safe home that was very inviting. A huge plus was the bed!
It's a lovely apartment with all the amenities you would need to enjoy your stay. The location was perfect, and the surrounding area is very walkable and safe. Though I did drive into downtown SF (which was pretty straightforward), you can take transit which is easily accessible from the home.
• Street parking is a little competitive and cars have to be moved off the street in the later afternoon when the parking lane becomes a traffic lane. We hope to stay here again on return visits.
Deborah Hines was a fantastic host! She was incredibly nice, very responsive, and made sure that I had everything I needed (and then some). Her home was adorable, and the backyard is the cutest.
Most everything you can imagine is within a 15 minute drive with some great options for lunch/dinner at an even shorter distance. We were mostly decided on where to eat one day for lunch, but Chuck suggested this place specifically and we switched it up - needless to say it was great. The home is photo-worthy and the landscape is worthy of the imagination of painters.
Cher Alexander is a kind, friendly host. This bedroom and private bath in Michael Krieg home was much larger than I realized, with a great little attached balcony. Cher Alexander provided bottled water and tons of bathroom amenities, and she went out of her her way my first night in town to give me a ride to a nearby restaurant as she was running her errands.
Angela’s place is spotless and in an excellent location, with the shops around the corner, water across the road and beaches a short bike drive away! Top host!
My friends and I booked Chuck's place for a fun weekend at VA beach. We also cooked all of our meals and Chuck would run the dishwasher and put away the dishes while we were away which was so convenient and thoughtful. He even had put out a personalized sign welcoming our group.
We loved our stay at Neva's! Neva was an incredible host and even recommended a great local topographic point for lunch. We definitely recommend!
Gorgeous stay. Stephane’s place is an adorable, very well decorated & clean basement suite in a very nice part of Tacoma, equip with all you need including A/C! As first time visitors to Tacoma it was the perfect place for a girls weekend!
We planned our first Airbnb experience very carefully and well in advance of a family wedding in Redondo Beach. Shelton Gill is a gracious, thoughtful, and meticulous host, and her accommodations reflect this. It’s obvious that considerable attention to detail went into arranging the cute, efficient, well appointed interior, with the serene, calming outdoor spaces adding a somewhat unexpected slice of nature for a sensory delight.
We realized right away that Lori Stewart and Sharann could easily charge twice the amount they are asking for each night, just because of the value of the place alone. The space is very clean and decorated beautifully with antiques all over to enjoy. We had a great time relaxing by the fireplace, eating the many snacks left for us (NOT on the bed ;) This is a one of a kind deal that we would definitely recommend to anyone looking for their own private fancy suite hosted by two amazing people!
The bungalow is a perfect topographic point to stay- close to shops, the beach, parks and pier. Angela goes above and beyond to ensure your comfort and to help in any way possible to make your trip awesome! We hope to come back soon!
We booked 1 week and had no issue , communication was excellent (Janet Luckman is very friendly and cheerful. We've stayed in over 2 dozen airbnbs around the world and this is definitely one of our BEST experiences! Thank you again Janet Luckman & Colleen for hosting us.
Angela’s place was exactly as-described, and exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for in an AirBnB for a first-time trip to San Francisco. Highly recommended host and location!
Do head over to the nearby Bernal Heights Park, hike up to the top for amazing 360 view of San Francisco and a cute swing on a tree! It was very comfortable chatting with him. We definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn’t mind a small bit of climb to get to the house and also doesn’t mind staying outside the city.
We were up visiting our son at Cal and it was just a quick 10 min drive over. I’ve been to the Bay Area dozens of times, but this place was a new experience for me. The Berkeley Hills have lovely views of the bay, and the neighborhood has lots of cafes and restaurants.
The view of Commencement Bay from the studio, the comfortable bed , furnishings and HD television, the thoughtful snacks all create a lovely experience in this clean, efficient studio. Parking is readily available on the street in front of the well-lit and inviting entrance. Christiana is an excellent host.
Heather's topographic point was such a great find!! But Heather was still there waiting to show us around and to give us the key. Such a nice and friendly lady!!!
It was in a good location with easy access to San francisco and points north. What a charming space! We were so very comfortable and felt so welcomed.
Being a single woman, I wanted some place safe and I found it at Elizabeth's. She took considerable time and effort to secure not only her home, but your room. I know anyone who has the pleasure of staying here, will enjoy their stay.
Lindsay Brown's cottage was perfect for the two of us during our visit in Berkeley. We loved exploring throughout the Rayford Kelly neighbourhood, the Berkeley campus and nearby Rockridge. There was a great variety of shops and restaurants nearby - our favourite was a little hole-in-the-wall ring shop called Dream Fluff Donuts.
Her home is in a great vicinity , safe, quiet, close to beach. Luis Hawkins is friendly and prompt. Her space is so comfortable and beautifully thought out.
Excellent stay. High ratings for a reason. It was perfect for a wedding we had down the street.
We had a great time at Tylers place. We loved everything; from the comfy bed to the amazing shower and the big TV to watch movies late at night coming back from the city! Tyler is the best host we ever had, he helped us so good!
The apartment is stunning and welcoming, the room is broad with every amenity you can think of. The apartment is located within walking distance of mission district and with good bus links to the city centre and park areas. Michael Krieg and his partner were warm and friendly and happy to help with advice and suggestions of topographical point to go.
I pulled up to the cabin and saw a charming well-taken care of abode, with a grill out front and small hearts carved into the wood panels for the railing. Do not shape your expectations that you are staying in a hotel, instead view this as your little family cabin or a family members. The place is clean and homey, with little amenities tucked everywhere but in a comfortable 'lived-in' style.
My colleague and I were in town to do a project that required a lot of creative thinking, so this space was just the fertile ground we needed. The lone thing I could wish for is a grocery option that is a bit closer. But don't let that stop you from booking this gem!
Best experience I've had in AirBnb! Location is perfect, the studio is beautiful and Christiana is the perfect host. There were fresh flowers when we arrived with some sweet treats, she turned on the porch light if we were coming in late and of course the studio is delightfully designed.
We relaxed on the comfortable bench, listened to the bird and smelled the wonderful orange flower. For someone from Florida, this is a large plus. The house is in a quite neighborhood.
The heat in the apartment was perfect but I like to sleep under many layers at night (I struggle with this at hotels too! Our stay at Natalia’s was wonderful and we’d come back again - it was as pictured but even better in person. We loved all the plants, the way it was furnished, a very unique space and very comfortable and clean.
The home itself has lots of charm and is nicely decorated throughout. While the small TV is viewable only from the formal dining table, it worked fine for us when watching a bit of TV in the evening. The kitchen is spacious and fully equipped with plenty of counter space and everything needed to prepare a few meals.
One day on our way back, we were really tired from walking around Manhattan all day, and as we came out of the subway, got in a taxi and where at the house witihin 3 minutes. On top of that, May and Igor were great hosts, always nice, respectful and willing to help.
I'd stay there again, for sure! Elizabeth’s place is everything you want in a stay away from home. The master suite was clean and comfortable with a huge bed and tons of natural light.
I live in Tacoma and have traveled the world for 25+ years, and must say I plan to again drive the 3 miles from my home to Christiana's studio, just to take a "stay-cation". Linda/Mike were great hosts! Super quick responses in communication and their rooms were much bigger than expected!
A perfect place for a couple people for a getaway. Would definitely stay here again! !
Angela is an outstanding host! Her attention to detail is impressive. Loved the bungalow and hanging out on the patio with the candles, tropical landscape, twinkle lights and iced cold beer.
I hope I will have the oportunity to come back again with more time. We had an awesome relaxing weekend in Hermosa Beach!
We enjoyed spending our nights sitting next to the chimney facing the outstanding view looking at the lake. We also enjoyed barbecuing and eating on the big table which has another corner of the house with the another amazing sunset view , bedrooms warm and neatly done as well as the bathrooms , we will definitely consider going back to experience the summer with this house
This cute guest house is the perfect beach spot. Only a block away from beach access and 10 minutes or less walk to great restaurants and shopping. The guest house was very clean and spacious.
Tyler’s place was spotless upon arrival and had everything we needed to enjoy eating in and cooking when we wanted to. Bathroom is great as well -- modern, high end, clean and plenty of hot water. One thing to note is that this is an in-law unit (garden-level unit of measurement of a two story home) and has entry through the garage and occasionally some noise can be heard upstairs (which Tyler mentions in his description).
This was my first stay in an Airbnb and I was very satisfied. There were extra blanket , which was fantastic. The topographic point was comfy and well styled with awesome books on San Francisco.
Fantastic location, less than 5 minutes to beach. Personal touches. Clean rooms.
My husband and I had a fabulous stay! It was our first time in Virginia Beach and we couldn’t have picked a better place. The location was perfect and the hosts were amazing.
Ben gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. Secondly the apartment is just fantastic. It's large,  clean and really comfortable.
For us a special bonus was the superb location - less than 5-minute walk to the wonderful Golden Gate Park – a must visit - along with excellent transport links to other areas of the city. We will definitely be returning!
She allowed us to keep our baggage in the space until we headed to the airport and indicated that if she ended up needing the topographic point earlier, she’d store it at her home for us. It was spotless, cozy, and beautiful. The next time I stay in Tacoma, I will definitely be staying there.
She offered us bikes to browse the neighborhood  The place is amazing and would fit two ppl perfectly. Parking is not an issue as Angela has her own parking space which we've used and also the st had a free parking spaces..  We definitely gonna recommend our friends to choose such a lovely place if they ever visited LA.. Thank you Angela
A beautiful place very clean and everything you need. I highly recommend this wonderful coastal cottage. Thank you Tiana!
Treetops is a lovely space, with great natural light from windows and a skylight in the bathroom. The sitting room extends the space, with a small desk and a sofa for relaxed chatting. The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra heat .
Other AirBNB places I've rented are more like alternate motel lodging, but this is what I imagine what a traditional bed and breakfast must be like. In addition, Zeena was very accommodating about my special request to check in very late due to attending a late night music event. There is a band named "Charming Hostess" that is related to the music I heard -- they were not present that night, but their title was instead ably filled by Zeena.
Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach. However, what makes our experience way too memorable and extraordinary is the personal touch that James Walker An adds in terms of extra comforts , tips, recommendations etc. In our case, she was very kind and thoughtful to let us know about her bikes, beach chairs etc.
The hosts have also gone out of their way to provide local tourist information, some games and toys for child , and an assortment of DVDs. Grocery stores, restaurants, and coffee shops are also only a few blocks away. It is about a 10 minute drive to cardinal Tacoma and 15 minutes to downtown.
This apartment, although small, was perfect for our purpose . Everything was quite close and we didn’t feel the need to drive anywhere. More friendly and helpful host you could never find.
Great stay! The house was in a great location for getting to the beach nearby.
The shower was hot and we appreciated the tea and coffee in the morning. Justin's spot was just as expected since they provide a lot of details, which is always nice with Airbnb. Communication was incredibly fast since I had a few questions in advance.
Nice private room, with a firm/ creaky bed. beautiful house, in a nice vicinity . Gin and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning!
Janet Luckman's place has so many sweet touches, like light breakfast options, coffee, and bottled water. Her place was centrally located and we were able to walk to many places in the area, or grab a quick Uber ride. I would highly recommend Janet Luckman's place to anyone looking to stay in SF!
I got to meet her the next day and she is just a lovely and kind person! She made sure that all was okay during my stay. I highly recommend staying at her place if you ever need to be in Bay/Oakland area.
She gave us a tour of the room and told us everything we needed to know. Although we only got to spend one night there we will absolutely book James Walker’s place again on our following trip to CA.
Very friendly folks. UW TACOMA & the museums are about a 20 min walk away. We intended to hang out at the new Christopher Brown but spent most of our time at Denise's suggestions Red Star Tacos  & The Devil's Reef (a hopping tiki bar with large + alone drinks).
The room itself is so spacious and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. One of the most surprising and delightful things about her place is that nothing in the kitchen is off-limits. It’s truly like you’re staying at a friend’s house.
I wouldn't mind coming to just hang out there and have dinner and a drink, maybe next time when I can stay longer than a weekend. Tyler was also very quick to help me out when I was having issues getting into the home.
Jerry and Julie were extremely accommodating and wonderful to work with. Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. I love sleeping under the stars and waking up to the ships on the water.
Kelly is very responsive and easy to communicate with. We loved this place! It’s pretty big and has a lovely little terrace outside.
Close to the beach and only 40 min drive to disney. What a wonderful place! Giant room finished with fantastic materials.
Jeanna is great as well. She provided great instructions ahead of our check-in and communicated to us on our third day about potential Internet problems as she was having some service done. We didn't even have to ask if there was a problem - she was on top of it!
We felt like we were in a cabin oasis, with the city laid out just beyond the gate. A truly unique space, rustic yet urbane, with every detail you could think of - even the outdoor shower was quaint and cosy. Our hosts were available and responsive, and their local tips were on the nose.
The place is beautiful. I have zero ailment and hope to be able to stay here again.
Would stay again! This topographic point is great, very clean and has everything you need. Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
Just note that if the snow is ever really bad during your stay, that it can be a bit difficult to get in/out of the parking area.. The apartment was lovely and the beds were very comfortable. I was traveling with 3 younger girls (12, 11, and 11) and I loved that the location was near plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, and parks.
The home is as advertised and then some with fine detail with the guest(s) in mind. They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. Take advantage of their guidebook recommendations.
And, the entire suite was spotless--a clean freak's dream! This was probably the best Air BNB I stayed in. Great service and hospitality by the hosts.
They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. This is the fourth year I've stayed at Brian Burns Charming Proctor Suite. It has become my home away from home.
This apartment, although small, was perfect for our purpose . Roberta Hallenbeck gave us lots of suggestions and reviews of the local restaurants, of which there are many and nearby. I wanted to stay longer just to take advantage of the food options.
The topographic point is great! Elizabeth’s house is perfect!! Location is convenient.
Shopping is close by at Bay Street in Emeryville or 4th street in Berkeley (all of which Luis Hawkins has laid out in a convenient welcome book) Easy to get into SF by the Bart at the Fruitvale station. The place itself was extremely spacious, stylish and clean. My parent's slept on the bed while I slept on the sofa bed (comfiest sofa bed I've ever slept on).
The room is huge, with a very large comfortable bed and great amenities. When someone says "My house is your house" very rarely is it true, but it certainly was during our stay at Elizabeth. The room was ready ahead of time, she pleasantly greeted me and my partner.
She was incredibly nice, very responsive, and made certain that I had everything I needed (and then some). Would definitely stay there again if I’m ever back in Redondo!
Paul was such a gracious host, very attentive and was quick to respond with any questions we had. When we wanted to stay an additional day, he couldn’t accommodate us because the guesthouse was already rented out for the next day but he made a few calls and found us another Airbnb to stay in! The location was outstanding so close to the beach and a bunch of great restaurants.
He even had put out a personalized sign welcoming our group. Overall, Joan Litwin was a very thoughtful host and I would recommend his place!
We absolutely loved your place. We loved how quiet it was and how close it was to the beach. We had fun riding your bikes along the Strand.
We had a wonderful stay at what has proven to be one of the best of many terrific AirBNB experiences. We were spending time with a child at University of Puget Sound, and it was an easy drive back and forth to campus. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet, and the space was marvelous.
:) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweet of liquor ! Wow! Absolutely perfect!
It's well stocked, including soda and water in the fridge, snacks and a microwave. He's got bikes and is just 1.5 blocks from the beach. We went for a walk on beach and watched the sunset.
I loved the loft room with its lovely linens, comfy bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light. Plus a nice heap of gorgeous thick towels. I was only there one night....but it was so so refreshing.
I liken it to house-sitting for your girlfriend, who has magazine-worthy taste in antique collecting and design! Shantell Preusser were comfortable and plentiful. The mattress is on the soft side, and as my husband and I do better with a firm mattress,  I had  a bit of trouble sleeping without rolling downhill towards him!
I'm a veteran Airbnb'er and my reviews are always honest to help that next future guest. Oh by the way, 5 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from literally everything (food, shopping, historic sites, gardens, etc...); I now understand why this property is voted by Airbnb a top USA Property - it really is AMAZING!
This is a lovely apartment and Ron and Laurie are very accommodating hosts. It is convenient to a BART stop - either a walk or short Uber ride - that makes it easy to travel to downtown or the Airport. I would heartily recommend staying here.
This place was perfect for our one night stay! Also, her dog Jessie was a major highlight. So sweet!!
You really could walk to a lot of places or to anything you would need even a grocery shop . Cal
Location is very good and safe area. I am a runner and ran a couple of mornings north on Yakima for a 5 mile run. Very close to Pacific Ave. shops; a 1/2 mile walk downhill.
His place is so neat and very clean. All of the amenities were great and we loved the building. We truly felt like we knew the host even though we never met him just because of his hospitality.
Room was small but excellent! Quiet neighborhood! Perfect for me, my husband and our 11 months old daughter.
Super cozy and comfortable bed, the space heater quickly took care of the chilly nights, lots of little touches like tea and snacks. The bathroom and toilet are outside and you have to walk a short path (through a lovely garden) to get there. All linens, towels and toiletries are provided.
Pictures do not begin to show the beauty of this place. Such a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and wonderful apartment with incredible amenities. We literally didn’t need to worry about a thing!
We didn't arrive until very late (after midnight) and she was very understanding and left light on for us. She was also very fast to respond to any question I had over Airbnb messaging. Highly recommend staying here!
Jodi Stallings thinks of everything, anticipating his guests' every need. In addition to being a great host, Jodi Stallings is a wonderful human being and delightful raconteur. We had coffee with him both mornings of our stay, and by the second day he was already like family.
I had a great stay at Peg and Jeff’s place! Peg provided a lot of great suggestions on surrounding restaurants and pointed out close by places like Billy Goat Hill (which is just up the street and has great views). It’s a very convenient location- walkable, close to muni stops, and easy to get a lyft.
The place was very clean and stylish. They even provide little candies on each bed! The lock system is very efficient as it does not require your phone or easy-to-lose item like keys.
So I did. Some of it completely unexpected (Geology? Electronics kit ?
Pamela Drew is a ace host! We arrived at 11 pm at night but she was there to greet us and check us in which we appreciated. We wanted to do BBQ and Pamela Drew made sure we had all the supplies to have a nice BBQ.
Scott is a great host who has gone above and beyond to create a great experience for his guest . As a working professional I also enjoyed the privacy and quietness that the room provided when a good nights sleep was needed. The ocean views did not hurt either!!
This is an amazing find in a city crowded with excellent listings. I'll definitely be looking to stay here again on my next trip to San Francisco, you should too.
Tyler’s home is not only gorgeous, but super cute and comfortable. We loved that we were able to make breakfast before going out each day, and loved how close it was to the beach. Tyler is a wonderful host!
It was very clean, bright and inviting. We loved the delicious cherries, blackberries oranges and banana bread that was left for us to enjoy. Loved the little back yard oasis where our daughter enjoyed taking some amazing pictures.
We felt safe, and it was nice and quite and peaceful. Thank-you for everything Amy & Dennis! We hope to be back again.
The house is extremely close to the airport - which is convenient, but I wondered if the noise would be problematic (I'm a light sleeper and pretty sensitive to noise) - nope, you can hear the occasional plane but it isn't bothersome at all, and we slept very well. So big thumbs up for Wiseacre, for Chuck and for his sweet dog Charlotte.
Would gladly stay again! Her place was supper clean, organized, and located in a very nice neighborhood. You don’t need to take anything if you choose to book it because there was everything you might need for few days.
Tony and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. Can't recommend enough. My husband and I just needed a night away and this place was private and cozy, exactly what we needed.
I contact Lori Stewart and Anita to ask what I should do. If you want your host to take care of you and be there if you need anything, then look no further than Lori Stewart and Anita. They (and their tiny house) are awesome.
Her home is beautiful, immaculately presented and quiet, and just a short walk to the beach and shops. Thanks Elizabeth.
The room was stocked with anything we needed and sparkling clean. Easy communication and parking available, which was a great added touch.
We absolutely loved staying at Sierra's place! My two friends and I were attending Brian Burns campaign launch rally in Oakland and this was the perfect place to stay for the weekend. We arrived a bit earlier than expected and my phone failed to send the ETA message to Sierra but she let us drop our things off and freshen up which was deeply appreciated.
We found her suite after discard a batch of options and I felt in love with the photos available in airbnb. When arrival the suite exceeded my expectation ! The suite is amaizing and I have no words to describe the bathroom!
I would definitely stay there again. We especially love her cozy outdoor garden - perfect for relaxing.
Jo how does get on our way when it was time to go I was able to make suggestions. She makes you feel part of the family immediately! Her home is sparkling clean and the beds are to die for especially when you are tired!!!
The bed is comfortable and the linens are clean and soft (and there are extra in the linen closet which is always nice!). The small touches and local recommendations are super thoughtful as well. I would 100% recommending staying with Star and Austin if you're ever in the VB area!
Jo how does get on our way when it was time to go I was able to make suggestions. Jo is a gracious, friendly lady who has traveled extensively and her home shows this. Her art collection is fabulous!
I just loved it!! She really made me feel welcome. They put so much thought into the decor and comfort for their guests.
Her kitchen is well equipt to meet anyone's need . Notes about the bedroom -  1) The bed and pillows are super comfortable ! We slept wonderfully.
BART is also only 10 minutes away , so you can't beat this place if you want to be secluded, but be close to everything as well! We would definitely book again :)
Luis Hawkins's place was just what I needed! It was close to everything and I was seeing Hamilton the night I stayed there. It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes.
Overall, we had a fantastic stay and would definitely book again with Paul in the future! This place is spectacular, more wide than the photos convey and beautifully updated. We used the cruiser bikes daily for drive to the Pier for brunch or Hermosa for fresh oysters.
I feel at home for sure. I also woke up late on my check out time and she was so understanding and flexible. The only thing is, I didn’t meet the dog lol I was waiting for the dog to greet us hahah, but maybe next time.
Location is desirable and my stay felt very private. Elizabeth Jones was an amazing host!! Her topographic point is minutes from the beach, it’s spotless- the ad doesn’t do the place justice.
This is an AMAZING Airbnb. Lovely host who was very communicative, both with specific instructions on check-in as well as helpful tips on what to do in the area. They also had great beach cruisers that they lend to guests, and we had a great time exploring the area and beaches with the bikes.
Check in was very easy and Tiana allowed us to check in early. Finally throughout the stay she was always available with any question that came up. I would definitely stay at this spot again.
The towels were soft and fluffy and there were plenty of them. But once inside, the apartment is completely quiet. If the weather had been warm enough to open windows, it might have been noisier, but we didn’t test it out.
Amazing, very cosy, very comfy beds, stylish apartment. We came with our family and children and we all had a fabulous trip. The apartment is like home from home and Betty Maust was fast to answer our questions and help us.
We are absolutely charmed by Jenny & Mark's wonderful unit. The best Airbnb we had stayed so far! We loved everything here, from your hospitality, attention to details, the unit location that is few minutes walk to Lindsay Brown bart station, the extra personal touch like complimentary basic food for guests,...... the list goes on.
Will definitely be a regular here. We got to meet your babies on the way out ❤
The room is small, but very comfortable, and the patio is a perfect place to sit and visit. Very cunning place with nice garden area right outside the French doors of your room. Comfortable seating area outside with couches n tables.
The book with very personal SFO advise is very useful and the spots recommended were fabulous! The coffee & personal touches through the apartment were a real bonus and we felt homely from the start! Heather is lovely and her place allowed us to explore San Fransisco feeling like a local!
We also appreciated the provided coffee and to-go cups and the fridge/freezer combo. It was our first time in Virginia Beach, and it has won over our hearts... and our stay at Star and Austin’s place played a huge role in that experience. The location was a few blocks away from the beach and the neighborhood was close by a few of our favorite coffee and dining spots.
So my mom first time using Airbnb with me  he was blown away on how good it was to be able to get a such a Nich place. So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe . I know  past experiences  that Airbnb have change my life on how I stay in a city or a place of my travels keep up the good work.
Completely walkable area - minutes to Whole Foods, fitness, beaches, plenty of great restaurants, coffee, etc. Extremely clean and Gregory Simons has thought of all things you may need while traveling and has them available! Loved having Betty Maust visit us in the courtyard :) Gregory Simons was very lovely and accommodating.
Plus, Michael is a wonderful, engaging host who will make you feel at ease during your stay. Cheers
They even offered their laundry facilities! They both are polite, compassionate, and real people. Their place is truly a respite.
I was there during a heat wave and while there's no air conditioning, fans kept the rooms cool. cozy bedding,  flowers, treats, best yogurt, pastries, fresh blueberries, mango, on and on...and, as others have said, the carefully placed notes to inform, we loved the place, and could feel Susan’s care in wanting to make it all that a get away suite could possibly be. How great is that?!
The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra warmth. The thoughtful provision of soaps, shampoo, tissues, coffee, water, teas are terrific. Plenty of towels, laundry service is included.
Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. After spending 11 nights at Arnold Jackson place, I can tell you the suite is great. It's quiet, spacious and spotless.
We had a room upstairs with a cute loft, which is especially great for a family with kid, though we didn’t use it. The lone pity is that no cooking is allowed, as it is a shared living place. Igor is nice and quick in response, and we really thank him for keeping our luggages even after check-out time.
Just a few block from the beach and Golden Gate Park. Would highly recommend this spot!
You really could walk to a batch of places or to anything you would need even a grocery shop . Thanks again, Neva! Hope to come back following time we're in So.
We loved all the plants, the way it was furnished, a very alone space and very comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and small touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. The area is great too - there’s lots of restaurants and cute shop nearby.
She was very informative and responsive when we had question prior to the trip. Her home is comfortable and clean and in a great area. Every night we stayed there she welcomed us back and was warm and asked about our day and experiences we had.
We wanted quiet and privacy, and this suits the bill perfectly. We did get a visit from his very sweet dog Olive, though, who I'm sure was curious to see who was in the cottage for the weekend. She likes ear rubs.
Igor is very nice and helpful. Very clean and beautiful house. Close to Train Station.
Also, because this topographic point is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood. following time I'll eat there! Highly recommended.
Marty herself is warm and welcoming but gives one privacy, a perfect combination. If you use the Oakland airport it is only minutes away. We highly recommend her place.
They shared their local knowledge, homemade bread, common space, and activity recommendations. They were available to chat and debrief after a full day's activities, but not overbearing at all! I would love to come again if I'm back in the SF/Oakland area.
If I come visit LA again soon, I'd stay there again. Great topographic point to stay if you want to explore the south bay.
I stayed at Tyler's place for a night and it felt like I was at a hotel. Tyler offered snacks and coffee in the room which was a great touch. One of my favorite things about it was the white noise machine and the black out curtains.
Shopping is close by at Bay Street in Emeryville or 4th street in Berkeley (all of which Michael has laid out in a convenient welcome book) Easy to get into SF by the Bart at the Fruitvale station. My parents and I stayed at George & Colleen's place for a few days while visiting San Francisco and had an amazing time. The location of their place was very convenient; everyday we drove about 10 minutes to the Ferry station and just took that to get downtown.
Her new mattress was super comfortable and both my boyfriend and I slept like babies. I would definitely recommend this place.
The only suggestion we have would be for the upstairs neighbors to be a little quieter in the mornings. I would stay here again!
Very clean and quiet. The neighborhood is very cunning and quiet. We drove to the topographic point we needed to go so I am not sure if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops.
There are lots of sweet helpful signs placed strategically around the space that add a warm, personal touch to the cottage. An absolutely wonderful place to stay in Tacoma! We loved every moment that we had in Tacoma in Proctor College and will be recommending it to everyone who considers coming into the area.
The airbnb is in a quiet neighborhood, but still close to the beach and all the downtown amenities. They recommended great restaurants and provided what we needed for our days at the beach. I would definitely stay at this airbnb again when visiting Virginia Beach.
Thanks NEVA!!! -Janna and Tyler
There were lots of nice touches and this had more of a bed and breakfast vibe to it. Joan Litwin Traci are also really great hosts! Dan gave my sister and I a full tour of the home and ensured that all concerns were covered, and Traci blessed us with a delightful , hearty breakfast each morning!
Elizabeth is a kind, friendly host. I love Redondo Beach; Elizabeth's is a great place to stay. Her house is located in a very nice neighborhood a couple of blocks from the King Harbor marina.
! A big screen TV and a comfy couch made the evening completely relaxing.
Clean place is a lovely upscale neighbourhood. The bed was very comfortable and AC worked well. A nice selection of shampoo/body wash is available in the shower.
The little extra touches made all the difference and I am not sure I could ever go back to a standard. The host was on top of communication with a welcome, check in and even recommendations based on our preferences. The location was just as described!
We also did a dolphin cruise through Ruddees. The great thing, these were all within biking / walking distance of Star and Austin’s place. This place is clean, spacious, the bed is so comfy and the place is quiet!
The room had a good lock on the door so it really felt secure. From booking to check out, Michael was extremely accommodating and thorough. I love to stay in unique spaces and Michael’s space was perfect.
Our rooms and bathroom were spotlessly clean. They were very helpful when we needed assistance on transport into the downtown area of NYC.
Neva greeted me warmly with her super sweet doggie. Neva's place was cozy and very clean. Neva also had thoughtful extras such as a basket of travel items in case guests forgot something - which I did so I appreciated the lotion.
Scott’s topographic point is super comfortable, clean, and friendly. He goes beyond the average with comforts . Feels like you have the whole place to yourself.
Louise was such a wonderful host - even though we only crossed paths in person once, her warmth showed through all of her communications with me. Super cozy and comfortable bed, the space heater quickly took care of the chilly night , lots of little touches like tea and snacks. I would absolutely stay here again if I find myself back in the area!
I especially enjoy riding motorcycle and loved the trail! This is our second stay at Scott’s place. We highly recommend it!
Had an incredible stay at Janet Luckman place. The suite is massive, modern, well-outfitted and an excellent value. We were particularly impressed by the luxurious bathroom (probably the nicest of any AirBnb I've stayed in!
The neighborhood was quiet except for the occasional neigborhood children laughing and somobody playing saxaphone in the evening! (loved both). Linda recommended a groovy grocery shop called Stadium Thriftway, that was just a short drive from the home.
Getting around was really simple, most restaurants and shop were just within a few miles, and there are gorgeous beaches on either side of town. A lovely, peaceful home in a beautiful town!
OMG, the bathroom is so well stocked with literally almost anything you need, even hair products and a dryer! Thanks Brian Burns!
We would definitely go back. Marc gave us a warm welcome to this beautiful place. Little things like the coffee and bikes really made you feel at home.
I have had the privilege of being a guest at the Ocean Park Cottage for the past 3.5 months as I've been in Virginia Beach on a consulting engagement. I can't thank Tim and Chris enough for everything they did to make my stay there feel so much like home. The cottage is a cozy environment with a completely stocked kitchen; comfortable furniture; quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance to food, entertainment AND beautiful walking trails and the beach is one road crossing away!
The outdoor bathroom is really clean and nice and showering in the green house was very special. Would love to come back next time I'm in Berkeley.
Truly a beautiful quite neighborhood not far from the beach at all! The space provided was beyond comfortable, and Dorothy Moser's communication was excellent! The neighborhood was super friendly and a sight to behold with a small near by lake.
Michael Kriegs apartment was exactly as I expected it to be, it is exactly as pictured, clean and aired. We found everyone (including Michael Krieg) to be extremely helpful to the extent that when we got off the bus we found drivers would often get off with us and talk us through where we would need to go to be picked back up again. Michael Krieg was the most accommodating host, we stayed for 11 nights and she ensured the place was cleaned for us during our stay and we used her washing machine and dryer as we tried to pack light.
There was miscommunication on check-out time. Advertised on Airbnb was 1pm however Shantell Preusser thought 12pm. We weren’t prepared for a 12pm check out as we planned for 1pm per what was on Airbnb.
Overall a great airbnb, as described, and would stay there again! Very comfortable and cute space. GREAT bed!
Both rooms have their own AC units. They leave you to your own devices but are up for conversation if that's what you want. This list is a gem, especially considering it's in Forest Hills, which is basically the Beverly Hills of New York.
We will definitely be back! !
See you again,,, Michael has created an incredible green oasis in the city! He’s led an interesting life and the chance to chat was a real treat, and probably our favorite part of the stay!
Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). The bungalow is very efficient, and we were coming from a hot place (vegas) so we were able to leave the sliding windows open the best breeze ever! They have all the amenities you'd need on a vacation.
Elizabeth home was awesome! it's a great place to stay if you will go near LA since it's not so far away. Also the the beach is minutes away.
As soon as you walk in, you'll see how spacious the room is and how tall the ceilings are. In addition, we found 2 wrapped chocolate pieces on our pillows! How sweet...!
Gloria was antic ! 10/10! Great communicator w/ quick response time.
Location to Seattle...about 1hr drive to Pike Place Market. Betty Maust, and quiet neighborhood. Thanks again for offering a fantastic place to stay.
We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental. We felt like locals and loved it! Erica is a delightful hostess, helpful and thoughtful.Thank you Erica for this wonderful experience.
The room looks like it was recently remodeled with more than a nod to “high end living.”  Check-in is very easy and security for each room is accomplished by electronic locks that are simple to use. just one word: AMAZING! I wish I could have spent more time there!
The mattress was soft and led to one of the best sleeping experiences I have had in a long time. I highly recommend staying with them!!!! !
The location is minutes from the freeway, UPS, old town Tacoma and Ruston Way. We would recommend to anyone! Already planning our next trip to Tacoma!
We found Arthur Paddick's Michael Krieg and it was perfect for our needs. I would  Definitely recommend her place . Me and my Husband are going to be staying there in a couple of weeks to Celebrate our Wedding Anniversary.
Jo made every accommodation we had asked for and then some. She provided very clean and welcoming atmosphere. She even had coffee ready to be made in the morning and breakfast.
The bed was cozy and the Alexa was helpful because I always fall asleep to music and I forgot my Bluetooth speaker. I actually rebooked her place before I even got three because she was booked out months in progress . I figured if all these reviews were wrong I had 48 hours to cancel — and sure enough every review was true true true.
Enjoyed our mother/daughter 2-day stay immensely! :)   Felt very safe; loved the central location; and appreciated the bikes to ride along the beach! Super welcoming and helpful hosts.
My Dad enjoyed the tasty and healthy breakfasts. He liked being able to watch TV in the sitting room just outside of his bedroom. He kept raving about how clean Zeena keeps their home!
Marcos Blount waren perfekte Gastgeber. Just perfect! We felt extremely comfortable, the room is modern and chic, everything you could wish for, even Aveda Shampoo...perfect down to the very last detail.
It has a cosy, relaxing feel and only a few minutes from the beach. Being able to use the bikes provided was a treat, which allowed us to explore much more of LA. Thankyou Angela for being a great host!
There are some nice comforts like an overhead projector, kitchen, game , drawing table, bar area. Access was easy and secure. Very clean.
Situated close to popular attractions such as the Museum of Glass, this home was thoughtfully furnished and clean. If you happened to forget something before arriving, the house likely has a clean spare of what you need (toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc). In addition, there were some communal food item available, which helped since I forgot to bring granola bars for breakfast; a quick PB&J did the trick before walking the town!
We had a great time. The location was perfect for a beach view, but we we also used it as a home base when visiting other parts of LA. Raquel Eastham was very accommodating and helpful.
Location was amazing with lots of great restaurants in the area. Francis Jones is the best AirBnB host we’ve ever had. He and Jennifer Merry sent us a very detailed message before our arrival with great suggestions of things to do, and also spent several minutes upon our arrival ensuring we knew the area, and answering any questions.
You can go to the Golden State Park walking. The place was clean and neat. A really calm and quiet vicinity  There is no stove, but you don't really need it.
The B&B is completely self contained and has everything needed for a comfortable stay. It is only twenty-five minutes in the F bus across the bay to the centre of San Francisco. Also within a ten minute walk there are shops for anything  that is required.
It was perfect for a winter visit to Chicago with the amazing fireplace and heated floors. The walkways and stairs were kept clear of snow and salted. We even heard a snow blower once or twice ;).
I would reccomend this loft to anyone staying in Tacoma. Absoslutely deserving it. Thank you is not adequate Gloria!
Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. The bedroom was warm and cozy and the desk was convenient for setting up a computer. The off-street parking made it easy to get your bag into the house.
I took a Chicago staycation to finish my book and Natalia's second-floor apartment was the perfect getaway. It was more than roomy for me, being just one traveler, but I loved the amount of space and light she creates in your classic Chicago "long-but-not-wide" floorplan. There was more than enough light and her cheerful plants and art made me feel right at home.
We did not meet Rod, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in directions were clear. The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. My sister and her family loved staying there.
The loft is very spacious, stylish, comfortable, surprisingly private despite the location, and secure. The business district location was very convenient to some local sites, and also easy to get to UPS (college kid drop off trip). We hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future.
And the walkthroughs and notes were all so clever. We also were able to find free parking each day within a few blocks of the topographic point , which was great. Location-wise, it’s great.
Staying here was like being at home. Elizabeth’s house is beautiful and in a great location! Nearby you will find the RB Pier, restaurants, coffee shops and more.
We spent 3 nights at Thomas George’s studio apartment and think that the only valid description for both the host and the apartment is ‘fantastic’! The studio was spotless and provided all that we could wish for in terms of comfort and facilities, including a chance to relax in the garden and some very welcoming breakfast and other amenities. For us a special bonus was the superb location - less than 5-minute walk to the wonderful Golden Gate Park – a must visit - along with excellent conveyance links to other areas of the city.
The bed was very comfortable. Wish we could have stayed more than one night! Great hosts, sweet dogs, beautiful vicinity , we look forward to visiting again and will recommend to our friends and family whenever they’re in the area.
Also recommendations are printed out for you. Scott’s place is the best! The room is spacious, the bed is incredibly comfortable.
Amazing deal and great stay. The guest room is private on the bottom floor with a full bath connected to the inside of the room. The room is immaculate with coffee, snacks, 2 beers (great after a long drive), bath robes, slippers, tooth brushes, soaps, and other toiletries.
Tyler and his partner were both very hospitable, even invited us to have a glass of champagne when Tyler’s family came over to visit. You definitely don’t get that experience in a hotel! We have no negatives about this place, it really is a unique experience - we have stayed in some pretty unique Airbnbs before, this one tops them all.
It was close to all of the delicious food and shops on 4th St, fairly close to campus but was nestled in a beautiful neighborhood with ample parking. I loved the modern touches mixed with the historic elements of the home. Ron and Laurie were very warm and communicative throughout the stay and truly thought of every amenity we might need.
Elizabeth's place was much more than expected. Slept amazing and very close to local attractions such as the Redondo Beach Pier, local restaurants and cute little boutique shops. Definitely will be staying here again if I'm ever needing a place in the Redondo Beach area.
It’s very stylish and a perfect size for two. We weren’t even there for 24 hours and were disappointed we couldn’t stay longer. Great for an extended stay since it has a full kitchen, but the neighborhood has lots of offering as well.
A cozy, clean and comfortable spot in the historic North End! The bed is super comfy and the sofa bed is also comfortable ! The space can fit up to 4 people!
Neva’s topographic point was conveniently located for a week of traveling around the LA area. We would highly recommend staying here!
The neighborhood was quiet and only a short walk to the ocean. Everything in this space is thought out from decor, to the layout, to the inviting patio. We loved leaving the door open at night so our little one could run in and out.
Chris' place is really lovely! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy.
We were up visiting our son at Cal and it was just a quick 10 min drive over. Justin’s place is close to the one of the best restaurants in the world, as well as the “gourmet ghetto” of excellent and inexpensive food. The room was clean and cozy, very nicely decorated, a cool, mini apartment under the main house.
Requested for some fire log on our last night to set a little fire outside the house, and Lauren Jensen was so fast in helping us to set it up after hearing our request, he even went ahead & hang some pretty lights outside for us, really makes us feel so happy! Would love to stay at Lauren Jensen & Colleen’s topographic point again if we have the chance to!
We were in the city to see Hamilton, but also went to the Art Institute Chicago and ate dinner at the Blue Door. They also had great suggestions for places to eat in their neighborhood. We went to Sweet Maple and Stax for breakfast and Rosebud for dinner one night.
The local park/trails were explored daily and we even took the bikes out! Tons of restaurants nearby and so many good options! Tim has endless suggestions for you to fully enjoy your time here.
The place is definitely perfect for a few people (couple, single, mother daughter/girls trip), comfortable, and one of the best Airbnb's I have stayed at. I will look to stay here for future visits. The place is perfectly located and if you are from Redondo and looking to visit then this will make you feel at home.
Note that the bathroom is quite narrow and the unit is up a flight of stairs. Neighborhood felt safe and we had no trouble finding parking on the street or very nearby. The provided Keurig coffee and small bottle of milk, fruit & little snacks were much appreciated.
We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for.
Shantell Preusser cabin exceeded my expectations. They were very accommodating about checking us in when we arrived a little earlier than expected. I was at first nervous about the outdoor shower situation but it is incredibly private and the area is kept very clean.
OMG, the bathroom is so well stocked with literally almost anything you need, even hair products and a dryer! The towel warmer was a luxurious touch. He’s such a great host, I would absolutely stay again.
Edward Ramsey's place is super comfortable, clean, and very well kitted out with everything needed for a short visit. A great spot for the southern beach area of LA. Edward Ramsey was a very responsive and helpful host from booking through to check out.
This all made our stay exceptionally easy and Tiana was fantastic to work with! Tiana's Beach Cottage is a prime example of why people are choosing Air B&B over traditional hotels. The location is unbeatable for Southern California; in the middle of everything you'll want to go see, but off the beaten path where you can really just take in the Beach sights and smells to ease your stress away.
Remember if you require a kettle to ask Jeff and he will happily provide one. Two recommendations - for great coffee and breakfast around the cnr visit Rayford Kelly which opens early and Delfina Pizzeria for a casual dinner just next door.
The beautufully clean beach is a nice walking distance (10 minutes) and the great shops & restaurants on the pier (20 minutes) as well. We had a great time with 4 adults and our small dog. Beds we're comfy too!
Beddings are 100% cotton. Hair and body care products are all great brands. And sparkling clean is not an enough word to describe the bedroom and bathroom.
We would definitely stay here again! what a stunner! i'll admit when we were driving into the neighbourhood we were a bit apprehensive, but Ian's place is an amazing oasis in the middle of the urban area.
The washer/dryer hook up is handy for cleaning your clothes. It's a small small to save space, but you could still fit about a week's worth of laundry in there if you want to clean your clothes during your stay or before you leave. And Joelle makes sure that she keeps everything stocked that you might need: blankets (even an extra one), sheets, toilet paper, soap, other toiletries, eating/cooking utensil , etc.
This is a lovely apartment and Ron and Laurie are very accommodating hosts. The apartment is within a short walk of a number of restaurants and shops and Laurie's suggestions for restaurants were great. In fact we had one of the best meals while we were in the SF/Berkeley area at Luca Cucina, which is a short walk from the apt.
I'd be very pleased to stay there again. This topographic point is like your home away from home. It was immaculately clean, very comfortable and beautifully decorated.
Joelle and Greg are excellent hosts with a top-notch location. Joelle was always fast to reply to messages and was very nice to interact with in person. The unit was super clean, decor was lovely, and had everything I needed.
Cozy, comfy, and spacious! Beautifully-designed guesthouse with chic, coastal beach vibes. Excellent location, just a short walking distance to the beach.
Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a little loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:   chef kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. The space is clean, absolutely stylish, homey, and centrally located within walking distance to great attractions that Tacoma has to offer. It was quiet and peaceful amongst the city bustle below which you’ll have an awesome view of.
We feel like in our home, warmly recommended. The house is 10min walking from a but street with nice bars, shops and restaurants. Train station for San Francisco is not very close by foot but if you travel in 2 or 3 Uber is cheap and convenient if avoiding rush hours.
Tiana could not have been better! If it were up to me, I would live in the small casita forever!
The house is well maintained, in a nice vicinity with restaurants and shopping within walking distance. We would not hesitate to stay their on our next visit to L.A..
Thanks Michael! !
There was a private bathroom for guests with toiletry . Edward Ramsey showed us around the home and there is a code for the lock which made it very simple. Parking was right in front of the home and always for available.
Immaculate  Luxurious  Chic Haven  Dissolve into the bath Melt into the beds Nourish in the kitchen  Retreat to Jim and Maximo’s whole apartment  Whenever you need a get-away feel during your Andersonville visit  This is my second stay at this lovely space. I am booking again shortly. Also see my review December 2017.
The host are kind and attentive. Anything you need, they'll have a resource. I'm already trying to figure out a reason to come back to Tacoma soon, just so I can spend more time there!
Not only that, but Christian is a foodie and an Oakland connoisseur, and he spent 20+ minutes talking to me about restaurant and local food recommendations. I could go on longer, but I'll just say that I had the best experience and the best sleep. Will definitely come back if I am ever in Oakland again!
The bedrooms have plenty of room, the bathrooms are spacious and the living room is cozy with a warm fireplace. The kitchen is a winner too. We love preparing and cooking our own meals while on vacation instead of dining out, so having a kitchen that’s spacious and fully equipped is a must for our family.
This place was absolutely wonderful. The space was cozy and clean and Chip (and his sweet dog Olive) thought of everything! They provided coffee, a French Press, and an espresso machine, plenty of tea, and had a handbook of suggestions for places around the island.
It was just the right size for our time in the Sunset Beach area, it had a lot of quaint local places to eat at, and it was super easy to use the Muni Transportation to get to all the San Francisco places we wanted to visit. The only suggestion we have would be for the upstairs neighbors to be a little quieter in the mornings. We were woken up to running at 6:00 am both mornings.
Guys this is the spot! We own 9 airbnb’s And are very finical guests! This place was perfect and priced extremely well!
We especially loved that it was only a couple of streets away from Ocean Beach and the spectacular Sea Cliff bluffs. We took regular walks along the coastline, and were happy to be able to come “home” in the evening to a place that was very comfortable and inviting. In all, we had an amazing time, and would highly recommend his place to others.
Highly recommend. All the comforts listed were  as described. Tiana was a great host, she refreshed our towels, and help get the Thomas George up and going as I needed to do some work while I was there.
This is really a hotel standard home but with much more thought put into every little detail, from the styling and color selections of the entire room to all the nicely designed and framed instructions and notes throughout. There is large TV, coffee machine, clean robes, slippers, and even a bottle of aspirin provided. We were surprised by the little instruction book that contains all house and neighborhood information we need to know, super detailed and graphically designed.
Overall, my sister and I had a wonderful experience at their lovely home and would definitely recommend to you future travelers! <3
This time we wanted something more cost effective, more homey, and a kitchen to prepare meals. I was so taken with the photos, description of Melia's casita, and reviews that I did not hesitate to book, even though it was across the bridge and would be a drive to SF. Our son was able to spend a few nights with us and we all enjoyed some home cooked meals....prepared with fresh herb from Melia's garden!
This is my third stay at Igor's place, which has now become my NYC base! Fantastic clean space, easy access to amenities, and a great neighborhood made Igor's topographical point a fantastic choice for our stay!
We stayed here for just under two weeks and loved it! With the spring rain we were surrounded by exuberant green, had a mountain view, a outdoor deck, well renovated and kept studio apartment to be cozy in, and with a car it was easy to get to amenities and ‘the city’. We cooked mostly in the toaster oven and it worked great with some creative meal planning.
The kitchen is nicely appointed, there are plenty of games and movies available, and there is even a great outdoor living space! I love waking up to the water and mountain views! Although I have heard rumors that it always rains in Seattle, we had perfect weather this past week.
If you’re looking at this place, book it!!! The rooms are super cute. The house is adorable.
Pamela Drew is a great host World Health Organization has gone above and beyond to create a great experience for his guests. Overall Pamela Drew was very helpful and easy to communicate with. He has a beautiful home that is everything pictured and more.
He helped us to move our luggage into the room when it was ready. Plenty of sheets and pillows. There was a desk area as well, the light were for able to dim at certain levels for ambience lighting and the washroom lights were automatic sensors.
Clean well kept bungalow with everything we could have asked for on our stay. Would recommend this place to anyone with small family looking for a place to stay in Redondo Beach.
The floors were clean enough that I walked around barefoot without an issue. He is a sweet man who is very willing to chat and share his life experiences with his guests. Being kind of young, we were a spot apprehensive about meeting him, but he put us at ease completely.
The space is advertised as a small noisy, but I found I hardly noticed the traffic or the trains (if you are very noise sensitive there are ear plugs provided for sleeping). Luckily the food recommendations from Lori Stewart and Hillary are great (hit up the Valley for sandwiches). The place is also incredibly convenient, a block away from the free train into downtown Tacoma.
Bennie Dudgeon and Mike are amazing. The space is just as described and although the bathroom is at bottom of the stairs it’s not shared and is super easy to get to/from....There is plenty of privacy at that end of the house due to the floor plan/lay out so it doesn’t feel (Website hidden by Airbnb) perfect. The location is at the end of a road so there is privacy, easy parking and it’s easy to come and go without feeling like you are bothering the hosts or the neighbors.
Clifford Winkler' place is really lovely! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Clifford Winkler quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy.
Mona is a wonderful host! You have a separate private entrance, full bathroom, room, living room, and a covered outdoor area. If you choose, you can rent out another bedroom too.
His topographic point is so neat and very clean. All of the amenities were great and we loved the building. We truly felt like we knew the host even though we never met him just because of his hospitality.
Brian Burns place was in a very nice location and was easily accessible. It was within 2-4 blocks from the beach and there were lots of restaurants within walking distance (Cajun, Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Gastropubs and Seafood). Marcos Blount was a great host and he adds nice touches to his place!
Shantell Preusser and Linda were great hosts. Their home is set up perfect to allow privacy as wanted. The rooms are above the garage while their living quarters and area are on the other side of the home.
The house was in a quiet yet easily accessible street, only two blocks from an almost private beach. We're also happy to have spent a beautiful afternoon on their beautiful porch. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and we only wish we could have stayed a few more days.
I loved this listing. My boyfriend went to the gym downstairs, while I enjoyed the coziness of lounging around in the living room. There are many little restaurants within walking distance.
(Which I prefer. My wife prefers a soft bed, but she says it was comfortable enough, and she slept well.) Multiple pillow option too.
Jodi Stallings's Proctor Airbnb in Tacoma, Washington is absolutely wonderful. Everything was so nice---easy to locate, good parking, immaculately clean, great snacks and breakfast food , beds were very comfortable with great bedclothes . Jodi Stallings was very thorough --- no questions were left unanswered.
Me and my husband stayed at Angela’s place for our honeymoon trip and everything was absolutely perfect. We had such an amazing time riding the bikes she had available for us on the beach! She was always available to answer any questions and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.
Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! Thank you Marc and Tammy we hope we can come back, someday :)
The next time I stay in Tacoma, I will definitely be staying there. The only thing I can complain about is not having enough time to enjoy this space to the full , since I was in town for a work event and had to leave at 7 the next morning. I booked last minute, and Gloria was very quick to respond and thorough with all instructions.
Thanks for a great stay :) Neva’s Roberta Hallenbeck was cunning and clean with  a very comfortable bed and nice linens. Centrally located in Redondo Beach- Whole Foods, cafes, restaurants, and the Pier were all within walking distance.
In my three years of experience with Airbnb, staying at Angela’s place is bar none the best experience I’ve ever had with an Airbnb listing. I now clearly know the reason why she has the ratings that she does, and why her place is booked so far out in advance. Every element, from the spa-like goodies to soy candles, was tastefully curated by function and design.
I had a short and sweet stay at Alejandrina Anderson's place. She was a wonderful host, prompt with all the response , and gave very detailed instructions. The bedroom and bathrooms were spacious and clean.
I am long legged so my only ailment was how close the toilet was to the wall when sitting down ;) the patio was amazing! Will definitely recommend to future guests! Thank you, Neva!
Debra Dibble place was an absolute gem. The apartment was spotless, and absolutely every detail had been thought of including fresh pastries from an independent coffee shop and breakfast items to make it easy for those needing to grab something as they walk out the door. Best Airbnb ever AND the area is absolutely beautiful if you want to walk toward the water to look at a sunset one night!
The guest house was very clean and spacious. It has great amenities, and Clifford Winkler is an awesome host! Checking-in to make sure everything is up to expectations, quick to respond to any questions, and very friendly!
We love Scott’s place. It is an ideal location in South Redondo Beach. It is immaculately clean, the bedroom has a super comfy bed and Scott welcomes the use of his common areas - large kitchen and lovely terrace.
The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. I would highly recommend Danielle's place for your next trip to Chicago. It is within walking distance of Logan Square and all it has to offer.
The place is newly remodeled in an eloquent and modern style, has a very comfortable queen-sized bed, small kitchen, and nice bathroom with probably the best shower I've ever had. The owners have lovingly seen to every detail of the place, from providing coffee and tea (and a jar of jelly beans!) to mouthwash (nice touch!)
Def will keep this one on our list to revisit! It was a last minute reservation and it worked out great. I needed a place to hold me over until I caught a flight out the following evening.
There is a cute backyard and our preschool son loved roasting marshmallows in the fire pit! We booked 1 week and had no issues, communication was excellent (George is very friendly and cheerful. He was always available when needed).
), extra toiletries if you forgot something, and even scissors (sounds silly but I needed one and was glad to find one!) are afterthoughts in many Airbnb’s. We loved staying here and will recommended to anyone we know traveling through the Bay Area.
Linda & Mike’s place was so perfect for two couples. The space was decorated really nice, everything was very comfortable including the beds & lounge area plus there was thoughtful amenities like a mini fridge, coffee maker & washer/dryer for guests to use. Linda & Mike were so friendly and welcoming, they made us feel at home right away and are truly amazing hosts!
Before saying good night, she even double checked our dietary preferences and was more than happy to cater to our vegetarian diets. They had a good spread of trail mix, granola bars, and kettle corn along with bottles of water on ice. They don't have air conditioning, but the room temperature in the middle of summer was more than tolerable with the ceiling fan and open window.
The place is very nice - very clean, cozy, with great washbasin space (feel like in luxury hotel :) Moreover, the neighborhood is very quiet, not far from beautiful beach (morning walks are amazing). It was a pleasure to communicate with Thomas George! Thank you!
Staying here was like being at home. It was our first experience staying in a private room so I was a little hesitant. But Bennie Dudgeon’s attention and personal touch made us feel welcomed and comfortable.
She kindly held the cottage for me beyond the reservation deadline while I found a friend with a smartphone to help me verify my ID. The bungalow was super clean and the neighborhood very quiet and safe.
Igor and May are such wonderful hosts! Very accommodating and understanding to our arrival, departure, and our need . The house is quiet and beautiful and very suitable for those who want peace and quit from the city.
The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. If you want to have a a good time in Chicago, don't stay at Danielle's topographic point ..... If you want to have A FABULOUS TIME IN CHICAGO, STAY HERE!
We would definitely stay here again when we’re in the area! Excellent location + excellent hostess = excellent stay! Angela was a pleasure to coordinate with from the very beginning and always ready to lend a helping hand (or thoughtful snacks too).
Our secret hideaway. When the bike had some trouble, they were quick to replace it. You will enjoy this place just steps away from the beach.
Thank you Elizabeth! We really enjoyed our stay. The place was beautiful and very clean.
Easy parking, close to airport and pretty close to everything else including some great hiking trails about 10 minutes away. I would definitely like to stay here again next time I return to the Bay Area. Feels like a cozy home away from home
 topographic point is very stylish, small and cozy. Clean place and good snacks. I enjoyed my stay.
Heather's Cozy Cottage is wonderful! Secondly, the bed is very comfortable. Both my husband and I have struggled with the quality of beds in AirBnb experiences in the past, but this Cottage is comfortable for us.
The casita is small but has everything you could want for a comfortable stay. ), to the deck with a hammock and stunning (Website hidden by Airbnb) was all so appreciated. I could not get over the special little touches everywhere like plants, candles, and pictures.
This place is a total gem. Just stayed here a second time. The room is  like a mini-studio apartment with a  tiny private courtyard.
It's very quiet at night which offers you a great sleep. Heather and JP are great hosts World Health Organization will help you with all your questions. All in all we had a very comfortable stay.
We make use of the wonderful washer and dryer that are available so that we can pack light. It was very well located, near many restaurant with divers cuisine, as well as very close to the lovely Lake Merritt, Children's Fairyland, and not too far a walk to the BART and downtown Oakland. We felt safe in the vicinity at all times, and slept very comfortably in our room.
We booked 1 week and had no issues, communication was excellent (George is very friendly and cheerful. We've stayed in over 2 dozen airbnbs around the world and this is definitely one of our BEST experiences! Thank you again George & Colleen for hosting us.
Great value, exceptionally clean, comfortable and cozy, with everything we needed for a short getaway. Star and Austin were always quick to respond to any questions we had and went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed during our stay. The airbnb is in a quiet neighborhood, but still close to the beach and all the downtown amenities.
Would stay here again in a heartbeat and wish I could call that little space home! Thanks so much for having us.
We definitely recommend staying with Lia and Gregg in their sunny, cozy, clean apt. and benefit from their great personalities and hospitality!
We generally had breakfast and dinner there and had everything available to cook our meals that we have at home - even a french press for coffee! Lots of notes on things that are humorous and helpful. It was great to have a washer and dryer that worked well, a roomy kitchen and living area.
There is large TV, coffee machine, clean robe , slipper , and even a bottle of aspirin provided. Would highly recommend Tyler's place and would definitely love to stay here again following time we're in San Francisco.
Proximity to the beach and Golden Gate Park are huge pluses! And the outer sunset has a cool bohemian thing going on. Tyler’s recommendations for places are great, definitely check some out.
The suite is completely updated with high-end fixtures, gorgeous natural light, and complete privacy. Jeffrey is extremely accommodating for check-in and check-out and highly communicative with prompt, informative responses. He was very generous in his offer to let us keep our belongings with him for safekeeping while we explored the area for the day, well past our checkout time.
This was the perfect place for us to stay in while in town for a family reunion. The bed was very comfortable, and the closet had room for our luggage. The private bathroom was across the hall, but posed no problems.
Had a lovely two night stay. We loved all the little touches of the cabin - comfortable bed, extra towels, soap and shampoo, sparkling water, privacy. It has a classic antique sort of feeling and everything is so well maintained you could feel that this little space has been well cared for.
Only met Neva briefly but she was so nice and I would have enjoyed to spend a bit more time more her for sure if she wasn't heading to Whistler for a ski :) Neva described her place completely accurately. It's a terrific location to enjoy Redondo and Hermosa Beaches on foot, or explore the whole South Bay with a car.
We especially enjoyed the close proximity to shops, the beach and use of your Beach Cruisers !!! Whole Foods is just a few short blocks down the hill. If you like to walk, you can walk down to the beach and over to Hermosa Beach as well.
Best airbnb EVER ! I can’t even describe with words how perfect our stay was. This is the coziest place on earth and Angela is the best.
Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. It had everything I needed.
I don’t want to write a review because I don’t want to share this place with everyone, it’s an amazing spot. Their home is a beautiful spot, clean, quiet, easy parking, easy access to freeway, guides and recommendations for dining and activities in the area, and a patio that we loved! sitting on and drinking our coffees at the end of our day.
Tammy and Marc were exceptional hosts. Everything was as expected and described perfectly. The room is perfect for 2 people.
The room is small, but very comfortable, and the patio is a perfect place to sit and visit. Very cute place with nice garden area right outside the French doors of your room. Comfortable seating area outside with couches n tables.
If you’re looking for a calm, serene, and intimate experience -- choose this place. It was perfect for reading, reflecting, and journaling. It’s also covered in twinkle lights and candles, so you can get a bit of starry night magic even if it’s cloudy (which was my case).
The location is perfect - close to transit to get to “touristy” destinations, but there is lots to see and do in the local neighbourhood as well. Tyler’s place was spotless upon arrival and had everything we needed to enjoy eating in and cooking when we wanted to. We would definitely recommend Tyler’s place to friends and family and look forward to returning soon!
For me it's all about the vibe, the amenities, and the location. My colleague and I were in town to do a project that required a lot of creative thinking, so this space was just the fertile ground we needed. Brian and Hillary were uber-responsive and the place had everything we needed - including coffee, tea, cream, and even a few local brew .
Chuck was really good at answering our questions and giving us advice of places near by. There are plenty of restaurants to go eat at if you want to eat out. Over all, I would recommend this place to anyone, you won't regret it.
Scott’s place was perfect for my LA beach weekend getaway! He was out of town during my visit but none the less was a very attentive host who made sure to message me to ask me my arrival time, check in on me and leave me tips about using the houses many amenities. That brings me to my 2nd point - the amenities at Scott’s were fantastic!
Brent and Francis Jones introduced themselves to us on our 2nd day due to our late check-in, they were both so very friendly, they made us feel right at home. They both were super quick to reply to any question or requests that we made,  our whole experience was AWESOME! We sure hope to come back next year and stay again!
Paul's place was excellent; very stylish and clean. I'd definitely book again if traveling in the area. Thanks!
The house is immaculate ! I just felt very comfortable staying with my 1-year old baby. Diana kindly let us use her backyard to decorate for baby’s birthday table, and we got a beautiful photo and unforgettable memories.
Jennifer Merry's place is wonderful. It was our second time and we will be back! I love that there is a desk now, since I do have to work a bit while away.
You don't need to go far for the best value shopping around. The Rego Centre is simply brilliant. Maggie and Jon's place is than any hotel.
Maggie’s place was the best Airbnb apartment I’ve ever been to. It was the perfect place to discover New York if you are staying for more days.
We loved the snacks that she provided as well as the convince of the award bar that was fully stocked! We can’t wait to go back! This stay was amazing!
Jeff and Mike are extremely friendly and helpful hosts. They dragged our bags up the stairs for us after a long day of travel, loaned us a backpack for one of our day trips, and gave us suggestions for meals and transportation. Easy to communicate with them by text.
Paul's guesthouse is clean, quiet, safe, and in a great location. He even has a shampoo/conditioner/body wash console table in the shower. TV has various networks to choose from.
Kitchen with all the basic requirements. Right next to the beach. Heather was very accommodating and helpful despite being away on a camping trip for the majority of our stay.
The cottage is well appointed and efficient. For me, proximity to the beach and within walking distance to a vibrant commercial district w/ cafes and restaurants was the best.
The large sum of people were split between inside the house and outside near the bbq food truck we had. So much space to move around. No one was cramped.
the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too. Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood.
We had the pleasure of staying at Wiseacre for a few days to enjoy some peaceful family time. Wiseacre is a beautiful, Pamela Drew inspired house filled with an eclectic array of art, history and personal touches. Rayford Kelly and Charlotte (the sweetest pup) were the best hosts.
It was a little cold during our visit so walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night was a tad little inconvenient but this was clearly advertised in the listing so it did not come as a surprise. All in all a 5 star listing! !
Thanks for everything Tyler! This is an amazing find in a city crowded with excellent listings. The room itself comes with hotel-level amenities, privacy and security.
She even took the time to write out a lengthy recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant spots were out of this world! :) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweetest of spirits! It was a short trip but Visited the Beach, Boardwalk and The Navy seal monument which was pretty profound!
We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. While it is a basement space, it has all the privacy you need including your own entrance. The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the small touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival.
T was amazing! Easy access into the cottage and easy to find with her directions! Thank you so much again!
My son is 6 and this was the perfect rental for his age. He liked to be out with the flowers on the rooftop. The outdoor roof is what blew our minds!
Her home is in a great neighborhood, safe, quiet, close to beach. Elizabeth is friendly and prompt. Her space is so comfortable and beautifully thought out.
The suite has a private entrance and parking in the back of the house, which make it easy to access. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable option in the area!
They have a very beautiful home decorated with antiques and estate finds that make it truly feel like you're right at home. Getting around was really simple, most restaurants and shops were just within a few miles, and there are gorgeous beaches on either side of town. Definitely would recommend to anyone!
Quick Communication Time and an even greater place to stay. Paul also provided some snacks and beverages for out stay. Thanks for everything!
I loved the photos to describe how to find the entrance to the unit. The room is quite cozy and comfortable with lovely windows overlooking their front garden. Their neighborhood is in an ideal location within walking distance of numerous excellent restaurants, as well as BART.
This home is in a great location, a few blocks from the pier and a short Uber ride from LAX. Elizabeth is an amazing hostess. She makes her guests feel at home, comfortable, and safe.
What an amazing experience while staying at her place. I highly recommend Angela and her amazing place. Angela THANKS AGAIN for being such an amazing host.
We really enjoyed our stay here. The location and facilities are excellent. The welcome from the hosts was amazing and this is a fantastic place to stay.
We had a great time at Neva's place. The room was small but perfect as a base to explore Redondo and the surrounding areas. I would recommend to anyone coming to the area to stay with Neva.
She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. stay here! I would give her more than 5 stars if i could!
The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. We were blown away by this great find and hope to be back soon! :)
Dorothy Moser and Jacqueline are amazing hosts, giving us tips on the area and San Fran, warned us about tolls, reservations needed for certain spots, and where the best people watching would be. Christina is a very gracious and thoughtful host. She was pretty responsive in her timing while we were messaging each other to figure out check-in logistics.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back to visit in a heartbeat! We highly recommend Wiseacre!
A cozy, clean and comfortable spot in the historic North End! Quick drive to 6th Ave, Point Defiance, Proctor and Stadium districts, UPS, downtown etc. Added bonus: within walking distance to the legendary Frisko Freeze!
Our bed was comfortable, and  the hide-a-bed my daughter slept on was also comfortable! My father and I were visiting my sister in University Place, Washington for 6 nights. My sister was actually the one who found the private cozy cottage for us.
Every recommendation was spot on and she was beyond hospitable. I took him to Disneyland on day 3 and she gave us all the tip to navigate the park and probably saved us hours with her inside knowledge. We were beyond impressed and the next time we head down, we will definitely be staying there again.
I parked a car and it was very easy to find parking. I appreciate that this area feels safe and it's easy and pleasant for walking. I loved the photos to describe how to find the entrance to the unit.
Esmie's place (Casa 2 we stayed in) was a dream come true Airbnb! As an Airbnb host myself, I recommend her place 100% --it was the best experience I have ever had traveling. And the location was perfect--in a safe, quiet neighborhood with easy parking, but close enough to food/shopping.
Checking in and out was super easy as both the outside door and the bedroom door have codes--I received an email with detailed instructions ahead of time. Parking is available in the driveway and there is ample street parking in the area. We really liked the "invisible" Dyson fan in the room!
Also the ceilings above bed are low/vaulted so even at 5’3” it was a bit annoying to get in and out of bed. Even still, we would definitely come back. The suite is gorgeous and comfortable and the host is responsive and so welcoming!
We would highly recommend Ben and Michael's B&B as a place to stay. We loved our stay at Michael  & Ben’s place. They are consummate hosts and offered many helpful suggestions for exploring the area.
Richard Batton was a great host and he adds nice touches to his topographic point ! A wonderful room to stay. And the host is kind very much.
They provide everything you need; you don't have to worry about bringing shampoo or Q-tips. Shantell Preusser and Lenora are definitely super hosts; we had a wonderful stay in their home for four nights, and they were so generous and accommodating when we were unable to arrive on our expected date.
He went out of his way to check in with us to make sure we were enjoying our stay and had everything we needed. Like a good neighbor! He obviously takes good care of this space.
We had a great time staying at Elizabeth's house. We were able to check in early which made our few days in LA even better. The room is lovely and the area was very safe and fun for drinks in the evening.
Tiana was an amazing host. I was SOOOOO in love with everything even the little backyard area. This is a phenomenal place to stay.
It is beautifully appointed and immaculate . It offers a great location, an attentive host and  thoughtful amenities. The house provides modern features, comfort, and privacy.
After a long day at the beach, we were able to wash away our day in the oversized  shower (loved the shower so much!) We would love to visit again in the near future. <3
:) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweetest of spirits! I would highly recommend it if you have an opportunity located on thirty-eighth street and the boardwalk. Hope to visit here again and thanks again Jennifer Merry, you Rock!
Extremely courteous! I HIGHLY recommend Paul’s topographic point .
The outdoor shower was a great extra feature— we were a little doubtful about showering in the chilly evenings, but the hot shower with surrounding fairy lights was HEAVENLY. Also, the process of checking in and out was super easy and fast. We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental.
Elizabeth was nice with us. Super recommend!
Sadly we did not cross paths with Brent or Lindsay Brown but their personal touches, including a thank you note and a list of instructions/restaurant suggestions, made it feel like they were already friends of ours! We will definitely recommend the space and return again in the future!
Thanks so much Paul! The bikes provided us with one of our favorite days in LA and it was these thoughtful amenities that made it one of the best Airbnb stays I’ve ever had!!! 100x better than any hotel could have offered!
Beautiful room and home. Super clean and close to the beach. Clifford Winkler was very friendly and responsive, as well as very accommodating with our checking in time and offering a luggage storage option.
Heathers apartment was exactly as I expected it to be, it is exactly as pictured, clean and aired. We found everyone (including Heather) to be extremely helpful to the extent that when we got off the bus we found drivers would often get off with us and talk us through where we would need to go to be picked back up again. Heather was the most accommodating host, we stayed for 11 nights and she ensured the place was cleaned for us during our stay and we used her washing machine and dryer as we tried to pack light.
His home is a real treat to discover with the alone architecture. Chuck is a consummate host, who sincerely cares about his guests. We felt very warmly welcomed.
I love that I was welcomed to utilize the living room, kitchen, and patio area. Everything was well equipped. The room itself is nice and clean, and the pillow was comfy.
Keurig,  towels, a fridge, water bottles, and great water pressure in the shower with very easy communication! Thank you!
Paul’s place exceeded our expectations. Small oasis near a beautiful beach, and quaint town with lots to see and do. Paul was an awesome host, very easy to get a hold of and very accommodating.
The bed and linens were over the top comfy and the bathroom and Kitchenette was stylish and updated. We were surprised by the amenities offered such as teas, coffee, luxury toiletries, local guides and even a bidet! Just the right amount of communication as well, accessible but private and Katherine is a terrific person we looked forward to talking with.
If you are looking for a quiet, private-feel  beach area, this is a cozy place to stay at. The kids playground across the street and dinning/shopping area within a couple minute drive. The front yard lounge area with beautiful trees and plants is a nice place to have your ice-cream or just to chill in a shade during hot hours of the day.
Loved the little back yard oasis where our daughter enjoyed taking some amazing pictures. It was such a warm genuine welcome. Thank you again so much and we will definitely recommend your place for future stays...Tanya and Aaron Furuto 07.09.2018
What a perfectly cute and functional small space. She even had beach towels, beach umbrella and anything else you may need for a trip to the beach. We even used the bike cruisers to explore Redondo and Hermosa.
This IS the Airbnb ultimate experience! We loved the quiet neighborhood and the ease of extra parking on the quiet side street just a half block away. Jeremy Johnson was a warm and relaxing host- she has a large, beautiful adjacent yard as well as a sweet cat.
Elizabeth is absolutely wonderful and the house is gorgeous! The location is prime and walking distance to everything you could want, from bars to beaches! Definitely cannot wait to return and stay here again!
The location was close enough to everything. A quick drive to the beach and the airport. Thanks again!
Elizabeth Jones are so wonderful and accommodating! For a cozy topographic point , this had all the conveniences that were cleverly designed in the space. We were close enough to make trips to Brooklyn and Manhattan no prob.
Not only was it lovely to be in a home in a neighborhood, but the room was like a lux hotel suite! Tyler has gone above and beyond thinking of ways to make our stay comfortable; a comfy bed, a sparkling room, lovely bath amenities, and snacks. It was great and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco who is ambulatory.
Amazing place to stay in SF, well-decorated modern house, with a perfectly connected AI system using Siri to control everything in the house, we were so impressed, and they have a full collection of Whiskey and an adorable aquarium. We met Tyler and his partner on the first night, they were both really kind. The guest room is on the first floor with our own bathroom which is very separate from the sharing space so that we enjoyed good private time.
The cabin is small, but John Mullins has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay. There’s even a fenced in patio to enjoy the sun during the day or a small fire at night. John Mullins made sure we were fully equipped to have a fun and relaxing few days, and at the same time made a point to give us privacy.
We slept like babies. I loved everything about my stay. Edward Ramsey responds fast, the bart is close by, there are great restaurants and brunch spots near by that I will miss dearly and they provide everything you might think of that makes for a great/easy stay.
It's super clean and comfortable, feels very private, and came stocked with breakfast items, extra tolitries, and sparkling water, all which were great touches. She was a great and responsive host. The location is super close to Golden Gate Park, and easy to walk or bus or ride share to other parts of the city.
 fantastic host and very comfortable guest suite in Noe Valley. It was sparkling clean and stocked with everything you’d need from keurig coffee and granola bars to maps and information about the city. Jeff and Elizabeth Jones were always quick to respond to messages and were very accommodating the entire stay.
Tyler’s place was spotless upon arrival and had everything we needed to enjoy eating in and cooking when we wanted to. Bathroom is great as well -- modern, high end, clean and plenty of hot water. One thing to note is that this is an in-law unit (garden-level unit of a two story home) and has entry through the garage and occasionally some noise can be heard upstairs (which Tyler mentions in his description).
I have to mention the good quality of the bed;)! Elizabeth was a charming host. I was flabbergasted at the size and  how extremely beautifull her decore was.
I just spent a glorious three nights at T’s cottage. The pictures represent it perfectly; it is exactly as lovely, bright, airy, and comfortable as it appears! T is an amazing host, so attentive and always available while still giving complete privacy.
This suite has the home away from home feel, with some added luxury. When my wife and I were researching honeymoon locations, no hotel matched up to what we were looking for. This place exceeded our expectations and then some.
The house is literally across the street from a market and Starbucks and right next to a parking lot, so we did not have maneuver San Francisco’s crazy parking zones. We came from Napa and arrived three hours before our check-in time, but Jeffrey allowed us to drop off our (ridiculously huge) bags and even brought them upstairs and had them waiting on our room at 3pm! The room was just as pictured; it has huge ceilings, beautiful finishes and the en-suite bathroom is stunning with the best lighting and full-length mirror.
Historic. Modern amenities. Charming.
You really can't beat this topographic point ! Truly a great experience! If we are in town again, we hope to find our manner back there!
I'd stay there again, for sure! Elizabeth’s topographic point is everything you want in a stay away from home. The master suite was clean and comfortable with a huge bed and tons of natural light.
We also appreciated the provided coffee and to-go cup and the fridge/freezer combo. Lots of thoughtful touches. Great value for a place so close to everything!
The neighborhood is clean and charming, and we loved walking around Wrigley Field and Lakeview. This was our best AirBnb experience ever, and Shantell Preusser and Joseph Lewis were helpful and communicative. We will definitely stay here again!
This is the most beautiful, magical little garden cabin in the middle of an urban farm. We loved everything about it. Very clean, with a comfortable, cozy bed, welcoming amenities, very quiet and private, nice areas for sitting inside and out.
We are happy to recommend Tyler’s apartment. My wife and I spent 4 days at Tyler’s Airbnb and enjoyed every minute of it. We’d planned this trip for 13 old age and finally got a chance to get away by ourselves without the kids and explore San Francisco.
If you happened to forget something before arriving, the house likely has a clean spare of what you need (toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc). The home is within walking distance to several excellent breweries, just note that there is quite an incline to the streets from the home down to the shops/museums/harbor. One thing to point out is that if you’re not used to road noise, the home is on a 4-lane 30mph road; thankfully, the host had already provided ear plug for those that aren’t used to it.
I met Chris & Tim multiple times during my stay; they were nice to talk to and they gave me multiple pointers on things to in the area that suited my interest. If back in the area again I would love to stay at their cottage again.
You can book this place with your eyes closed. The mega + was definitely all the stuff available in the house ( great choice of tea, coffees, towels, sugars, real cooking ustensiles etc.) in great quantities which really makes the accommodation very homey and generous.
The decor is beautiful! Our favorite was sitting out in the private patio, drinking our morning coffee, or having an afternoon cocktail. Bob and Sharrann have thought of everything to make their guests comfortable and happy.
The cottage (aka OPC) is quaint and cozy, and it is the perfect size for any couple looking for a beach getaway! there is no tv), and it worked perfectly in our favor. This was the perfect vacation we were looking to have, and the OPC was the perfect place to stay!
Scott also provided snacks in the room and lots of toiletry items in the bathroom--even sunscreen which we shoulda used. Walking to the beach was no biggie for my bf but I will say as a heads up that if you are fat (self included), the beach is probably a tad further than you wanna walk, especially since the return walk is uphill. We went in our rental car the 2nd time and had no trouble finding parking (and this was memorial day weekend).
Chuck is available and close by, yet you feel like you have the house alone. I loved relaxing in the hot tub, robes provided, the chefs kitchen and cool lighting. I think our stay will be a sweet memory, not just lodging on a trip.
With luxurious touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. Also, loved that there wasn’t a television . Go sit outside on the awesome patio and talk about how lame its going to be when you have to leave this place.
There is a reason why everyone gives Angela 5 stars! My wife and I had a great 4 night stay. Everything was thought of from extra charging cords, to fresh flowers, soap and shampoo, to water, coffee and extra snacks!
Her home was lovely, so clean and had nice touches. Apparently the main heat wasn’t working, but I couldn’t even tell. Ewa had placed a space heater in the bedroom and the fire place in the living room gave off good heat.
We will definitely be back. She has everything you need for a day at the beach , or a day out on the bikes. Will be staying there again on our next visit.
They are excellent hosts who are kind, considerate, and thoughtful. They provide everything you need; you don't have to worry about bringing shampoo or Q-tips. Everything is there!
Apparently the main heat wasn’t working, but I couldn’t even tell. So it was nice and cozy despite the blizzard that was happening outside. Ewa also gave me quite a few suggestion about things in the neighborhood to do, topographic point to eat, and how to get around.
You won't regret it. Laura is such a incredible host. She is so lovely and friendly everyday.
This is the ideal place to rest your head for one or two nights in Tacoma, WA. Jimmy is a helpful and welcoming host. Everything listed in the posting is included in your stay, although I would further recommend asking Jimmy about his other businesses and view on the geopolitical landscape for an eye-opening chat.
I know that the  Quality  That I got can’t beat it in a hotel even a  Waldorf Astoria. I will definitely come back and stay with you guys . I really loved everything, I can’t describe how thankful and greatf for you both.
Staying at Jose’s was magnificent. The apartment is very clean, stylish & perfect for a getaway! Jose accommodated my family in every way possible, from letting us check in early, drove us to our event we were in town for & gave great suggestions of places to visit, eat & easiest ways to get around Chicago.
Super quiet neighborhood with 6th just two blocks away. We stayed for two nights, Arnold Jackson was very accommodating and checking in and out was a breeze. Her place was sparkling clean, comfortable and the décor was topographic point on.
Robert Turpen thoughtful, speedy  attentiveness made the lodging part of our trip an effortless high point. When my gf and I walked through the door we were blown away by how amazing this place is. I wish we could’ve spent more time just chilling at this home lol we were seriously in love!
 restaurant around the corner, food marts and drug shop . Definitely my go to for Norfolk. Happy stay to you!
He also responds quickly when you have any questions. We mostly stuck to Valencia Street which is the trendier area and ate down there two of the five nights we stayed. Transport links for further away are great too, with a 25 minute bus ride into the city centre a mere 2 minute walk from the house.
Jennifer Merry home was warm, inviting, and so clean. The check in and check out process was simple. The bed was so amazingly comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud!
it's there!)! Definitely the best airbnb experience I have had to date and I hope we can stay there again! Thanks Michael!
Gorgeous position ! Restaurants around the corner, food marts and drug stores. Downtown is but a 15 minute rive, super easy.
Tammy and Marc are wonderful hosts. We had a wonderful time, we will definitely come back.
Matthew An made certain we had everything we needed while we were there and we loved chatting with him! We were literally headed to the airport talking about when we were going to come back. Thank you again Matthew An!
Paul's guest house was very clean, nicely decorated and well stocked. The beaches in the area are beautiful and provide many miles of bike trails.
Communication was very easy and although everything ran smoothly we felt like if anything had arisen Linda and Dan would be very easy to reach and take care of anything within their power. We would love to stay there again the following time we are in town.
We loved the garden area and enjoyed sitting outside to eat breakfast and relax. We really appreciated their flexibility with check-in and all the special touches that were included. This is one of the best Airbnb's that we've ever stayed in!
We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. Loveeeeee this topographic point ! Its make me and my friend feel like a home-y!
I had a great stay at Peg and Clifford Winkler topographic point ! The place itself is also very broad with a great back patio and beautiful high ceilings and skylights! Would definitely stay again!
100 stars ! Thanks again for being a great host
There is a reason why everyone gives Angela 5 stars! My wife and I had a great 4 night stay. Everything was thought of from extra charging cords, to fresh flowers, soap and shampoo, to water, coffee and extra bite !
There's no wonder why she's called a SUPERHOST and always booked! We are not AirBnB veteran , only having used it a couple of times, with somewhat assorted results. If it were like this every time, we would use it a LOT more.
The space is perfect for two and had fun amenities like a very large TV and varied National Geographic magazines. We had everything we needed and Heather was a fantastic host. We’re looking to stay here again when looking for apartments before we move to Tacoma.
It's super clean and comfortable, feels very private, and came stocked with breakfast items, extra tolitries, and sparkling water, all which were great touches. The bed was too firm for my back (though my husband loved it) and Chris graciously set up the airbed for me. She also let us stash our luggage for a few hours after checking out, which was kind and very helpful.
We loved that we could control the AC since I get cold very easily and the area was very quiet. Ewa’s place in Chicago was perfect! The private parking lot in the back was a major plus and the area was very safe and trendy with lots of shops and restaurants up Milwuakee Ave. Ewa provided many different amenities when we checked in and tons of useful local tips.
Tammy’s place was exceptional. Tammy and Marc were very helpful with everything. Definitely stay here if you’re looking for a quiet little getaway.
The kitchen is well-equipped, and the thoughtful touch of eggs, English muffins, milk, coffee, etc., etc. Jenny & Mark are antic hosts, who were very quick to respond to messages. We'd love to stay there again.
Check in was easy. I didn't stay at Marcos Blount's but have organised for my parent and my small sister to stay at Marcos Blount's. It is their first time in the US and is the first time using AirBnB.
Oh, and the bed was really comfortable - meant for sleeping in. We were up visiting our son at Cal and it was just a quick 10 minute drive over. We can't wait for another time we can visit so we can stay here again!
As my first Airbnb experience, Maggies place surpassed my expectations with her eye for details, the cleanliness of her apartment and her attentive attention to the needs of her guests ( complimentary snacks and toiletries) has made my holiday one of the most memorable stays in New York and I can’t wait to return ! This was my second time staying in Igor's and May's home, but my first time staying in this room. The house, as it was during my last stay, still amazing: it's a beautiful space that is well-maintained by May.
Great amenities offered like all goodies you need for the beach - things you don’t or won’t pack. Always a great stay for us!
Easy access to the highway was convenient and worked well for us. Happily, we were more focused on spending time to catch up since my son and I are on opposite coasts, and hanging at the loft provided us that...even though our pool skills could use some work! Thanks for a great stay!
If you’re looking for a very relaxing space with a great host then this is the place for you! The room looks like it was recently remodeled with more than a nod to “high end living.”  Check-in is very easy and security for each room is accomplished by electronic locks that are simple to use. Great stay!
I think our stay will be a sweet memory, not just lodging on a trip. When I booked Wiseacre, I remember thinking that the price seemed surprisingly low, almost too good to be true. Then, once I'd committed, I noticed that we would be sharing the house with the owner.
We highly recommend this home for your stay in the area and will definitely be back one day! From the Shampoo, conditioner and body wash to the laundry detergent and fabric softer sheets, they have you covered if you forget something or just need to do a load of laundry. :) They have board games for the kids, a variety of movies and books to choose from.
We wanted to move in. We are so thankful we chose this spot! Immaculately clean.
This is a very cool, unique space. There are some nice amenities like an overhead projector, kitchen, games, drawing table, bar area. I arrived to the place late both nights I stayed and felt very safe.
everything  you could possibly need, sublime hosting...... Great location, friendly/kind host, so many generous, considered extra touches that just make your vacation experience better. Couldn't recommend this place more highly. 10 out of 10.
The room has everything a normal hotel room would have, and more. We had a wonderful stay at their place and would stay again anytime we visit the area. Thanks Alejandrina Anderson and Betty Maust!
Chris has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and relaxing! There were bottles of water, juices, and yogurts in the fridge. Extra towels, iron, travel size bathroom essentials in case you forgot yours and even umbrellas!
We really enjoyed that. We'd definitely stay here again! Felt much more like a cute little inn so we didn't feel like we were invading anyone's personal home.
If you’re looking for a space near the beach in Redondo, you will not be disappointed! The space is beautiful, comfortable, clean and very inviting. And it’s really just a short walk to the beach!
You can book this place with your eyes closed. Even though it’s quite far from downtown it’s definitely worth it. It’s definitely cheaper ( and better) than what you can find downtown.
You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!
The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked. We had a parking spot in the driveway for the duration of our stay which was awesome. Star and Austin did offer us bikes to use which was sweet, but we didn’t end up using them.
Maggie is an amazing, friendly host; she responds quickly to our problem. The beds and pillows are super clean and comfortable at Maggie's topographic point . We are glad to stay at this cozy home during our stay in New York.
The location of his apartment is fantastic. He has a lovely terrace filled with flowers, which was a perfect place to relax. His apartment is decorated with a lot of unique and fascinating items.
The place is definitely perfect for a few people (couple, single, mother daughter/girls trip), comfortable, and one of the best Airbnb's I have stayed at. I will look to stay here for future visits. The topographical point is perfectly located and if you are from Redondo and looking to visit then this will make you feel at home.
are afterthoughts in many Airbnb’s. The apartment was very private and quiet. Most of all, we loved meeting Ralph & Laura.
We especially appreciated using the bikes to ride along the beach in the morning. Check in instructions were very clear and precise. The place was very clean and comfortable.
Close to the beach and only 40 min drive to disney. What a wonderful place! elephantine room finished with antic materials.
This IS the Airbnb ultimate experience! We loved the quiet neighborhood and the ease of extra parking on the quiet side street just a half block away. Michelle was a warm and relaxing host- she has a large, beautiful adjacent yard as well as a sweet cat.
The towel were soft and fluffy and there were plenty of them. That no doubt helps with the energy use but it takes a little human adjustment  We ended up taping over the bathroom light sensor so it didn’t blast on in the middle of the night when one of us wandered into the bathroom. • The building is on a busy main street, which concerned us as we arrived -- I am very sensitive to noise.
Jimmy is a kind and accommodating host. He also has a sweet dog that is extremely well behaved and let me love on him several times. I was attending an event at the nearby Hotel Murano and this was in close enough location to get there in 5 minutes driving.
It is beautifully decorated and the host have thought of everything! It is very welcoming and comfortable. My daughter and I spent the afternoon there before going out to dinner.
We stayed at Ron and Laurie’s place when we were helping with day care for our granddaughter in the area. Some of those particular touches included fresh flowers,  fresh ground coffee, homemade granola and containers of Greek yogurt for breakfast, evening snacks (cookies and tea), and a lovely patio,  The location was GREAT — a block from the 4th Street area in Berkeley, where we always enjoy spending time at our visits to Berkeley. They clearly labeled items as to their location and how various things worked.
For the past 20 years we have camped at First Landing State Park, of which our favorite facet is the Cape Henry bike trail which spans from 64th street, through first Landing all the way to Jade st.  Bennie Dudgeon place is about 200 feet from this trail so we were smack dab in the middle of all of our favorite things. The bayside beach, First landing, our local friends and maybe best of all two amazing eateries that have a plethora of Vegan Options, Citrus and Sugar Shack Donuts. This location pretty much offers it all and we found ourselves mostly just jumping on our bikes to grab a few groceries, a drink or a bite to eat.
Overall, this topographic point felt like home and was very cozy. Shantell Preusser and Merv were very kind, their dogs are cute and friendly, and we feel lucky to have stayed at their place! -Madi & the girls
My family and I had a wonderful experience at The Carriage house. Brent was very helpful with responding to our questions in a timely manner. We enjoyed  the close proximity to the beach.
Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. We stayed at Tyler’s place for two nights before leaving for two nights for a Yosemite tour and then coming back for another 4 nights. Tyler was very accommodating and allowed us to store our luggage in his office and brought it down to the room on the day we returned.
She added all if these extra touches that made it so homey and comfortable. We highly recommended staying here. It is a hidden gem!
Jeff & Mike waren perfekte Gastgeber. Just perfect! We felt extremely comfortable, the room is modern and chic, everything you could wish for, even Aveda Shampoo...perfect down to the very last detail.
The B&B is completely self contained and has everything needed for a comfortable stay. We arrived late afternoon and really appreciated that there was coffee and tea plus milk and some breakfast items supplied. We would highly recommend Ben and Michael's B&B as a place to stay.
Louise is also very accommodating. Also provided is a space heater, which works well, an  umbrella and a flashlight. Louise is an excellent communicator and host; though we did not get to meet in person, I got a good vibe.
This place is PHENOMENAL!!! Words can't describe how lovely having a glass of wine on the patio in bloom is while surrounded by the incredible sights and sounds of the city! We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cunning and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable bed .
It's walking distance around the corner from a restaurant + bar (Hudson House) owned by Top Chef alum Brooke (we went for dinner twice), and walkable to a lot of other wonderful espresso/coffee places. My husband and I would LOVE to stay here again!
Thank you for a great stay, we hope to be back! !
Neva's place is a perfect studio in Redondo Beach. Stylish upgrades, close to everything, quick communication, great value. On top of all that, Neva is wonderful and so is her pup Logan.
Jo provides all the amenities one could possibly need and the house is superbly clean. You can count on Zeena to make your stay wonderful. Her home is immaculately clean, the room is spotless, and the linens and towels are sanitized before each guest.
Bennie Dudgeon is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive. And the home and grounds are broad enough that we were never in each other's way. He works quietly in his office most of the time, but is readily available for a chat, advice, or a recommendation for food or something to do.
We will definitely be returning! Wow! What a great find!
What really solidified my confidence in staying in this home was Sheri Vowell hospitality. Another plus, was the proximity to activities and restaurants! Thank you for having us!
I’ve been lucky with nearly always great places where I’ve stayed with AirBnB. This is one of those places. Historic.
Easy check in beautiful house, great location and most importantly very comfortable bed and quiet neighborhood. Elizabeth was also very accommodating with my travel agreement . Definitely recommended!
The cottage is comfortable and has its own private entrance, parking space and patio. It’s on a quiet side street but close to restaurants and shop . Tiana is a very responsive and attentive host.
There are so many unique touches and amenities. We enjoyed listening to the albums on their turntable, and we used their projector to watch some YouTube videos. We hung out at their beautifully lit bar.
We appreciated a prompt communication in cases we had questions. The bus stations are also very close. So, we would highly recommend this nice apartment to all NYC visitors.
Absolutely loved this perfect little spot. Perfect area, secluded in what seems to be such a busy topographic point , easy parking, & super cunning !!! Her backyard is amazing, especially at night!
If I come visit LA again soon, I'd stay there again. The backyard is relaxing as well. It's close to Manhattan Beach, Redondo, Robert Turpen and Hermosa!
I hope to be back in the summer months! Chip's place is LOVELY! In some ways, I'd have to say that it's not as described because it was bigger and nicer than I anticipated from the photos!
Jeni was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area. While attached to another house, we never heard the neighbors or had any issues. The house is pretty close to some nearby homeless shelters & streets filled with tents,  but this is a common occurrence all over the Seattle/Tacoma area & we never once felt unsafe.
Elizabeth's place is very nice and cozy. The room is huge and well equipped (TV, walking closet, shower, locker, etc.). Elizabeth was very nice and really reactive.
Mona's place was lovely! The screened in porch with hammock where you can look out over a little feeder is so peaceful! The shower is antic and the bed was super comfortable.
Check in was very easy since the host sent me the code in advance, and it was nice my bedroom had a separate code on it too since there were other guest rooms in the house. It was a quick walk down to the beach and the strand, and a cute residential area where I felt safe. Would recommend!
We visited San Francisco on our honeymoon and weren't  sure what to expect since neither one of us had ever been to the west seashore . Our host for the week definitely helped us to feel right at home in an unfamiliar place. John Brashier was so kind and hospitable.
Melia's casita is a wonderful place to stay when in the Bay Area! I would highly recommend this great place for any visitors, and I hope to be able to stay there again in the near future!
Great place to stay in a great location. Angela was very responsive when I had questions. The place was very clean and cozy.
Beautiful decor, a nice bed, and plenty of other little touches made the cottage such an enjoyable place to stay. We loved starting the day hanging out on the cute little porch swing, listening to the birds. The beach is just a short walk away through a beautiful quiet neighborhood.
Unfortunately due to delayed luggage we lost some time and didn't get to explore as much as planned. I would certainly come back and highly recommend to others.
She couldn’t be more friendly and polite! Alameda itself has lovely character and a great assortment of restaurants and shops with a small town feel! We definitely recommend staying with Lia and Michael Krieg in their sunny, cozy, clean apt.
It is beautifully appointed and spotless. It offers a great location, an attentive host and  thoughtful amenities. The house provides modern features, comfort, and privacy.
We enjoyed it so much we plan to book more stays starting next month. Both Tiana and her Husband are truly wonderful . If you get lucky and there is availability you must book a stay.
We felt extremely comfortable, the room is modern and chic, everything you could wish for, even Luis Hawkins...perfect down to the very last detail. The location is simply unbeatable, Fillmore Street around the corner with great shops and restaurants. Lois Davis were perfect hosts.
Their house was emotionally warm and amazing in every aspect! We've stayed in over 15 Airbnb's but NOTHING or NO ONE has ever come close. If you're going to Tacoma and don't experience a stay with them, well, you're missing out on so much!!
The bathroom is plenty sufficient. It was nice to have a large dining table plus a couch with coffee table to allow space to read and work. Definitely recommend if you need a place to stay in metro Seattle.
The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. The book of local recommendation were such a nice added bonus along with the booklet of their favorite SF public spaces. Just overall a well thoughtout and quaint Airbnb experience.
If you don't want to be stuck in a high rise condo next to rowdy college kids, this is the place for you! Man, it’s really hard to explain the amount of comfort, appreciation and hospitality that Brent provided. No exaggeration when I say I felt as if I were at home, didn’t have to ask for anything.
Michael's place was just what I needed! It was close to everything and I was seeing Hamilton the night I stayed there. It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes.
They really are super hosts. Absolutely perfect for my needs. Highly recommend this place for sure.
We knew what type of place we were heading into from the photos, but when we actually arrived  we were so surprised on how beautiful this place was in person. Lucky for us, the sun was out this week so we got a beautiful view of the water, and Marcia was kind enough to let us see more of the view from her own balcony. The room itself had a warm welcoming feeling.
Not only is the house perfectly located in the charming Proctor District, Raquel Eastham creates an immaculate, spacious home that could be featured in House Beautiful magazine or HGTV. She has impeccable attention to detail - from her fresh flower arrangement, a colorful collection of local guidebooks and personal recommendations, an iPad to use (loaded with apps to find local things to do), to bedside water carafes filled with filtered water on a tray with sealed personal earplugs and local handmade caramels. Raquel Eastham saw to it that we had everything and more.
Wonderful and quiet location! Check in/check out was very quick and easy. The room was clean with plenty of towel .
Not only is the house perfectly located in the charming Proctor District, Susan creates an immaculate, spacious home that could be featured in House Beautiful magazine or HGTV. There's no wonder why she's called a SUPERHOST and always booked! From now on, whenever we revisit the Seattle area, we will definitely look to stay here first!
My husband and I stayed here for two nights before I dropped him at SFO  The space is clean and roomy (for a studio), with high ceilings, a walk in closet, large bathroom, and comfortable seating area. There is a good, reasonably-priced small market with variety two blocks away, as well as several nice coffee shops and restaurants in easy walking distance. We stayed during the week and had to manage street parking, but we always managed to find a spit within two blocks.
We had fun and laughed a lot with Michael especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . And by the way those new 4 recently refurbished rooms are so beautiful with individual bathrooms ; high ceilings and have an early 20th century style . It was a great pleasure to have stayed in your place Michael .
Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed amenities. There is even a killer coffee shop right on the corner. The unit is basically made up of the bedroom, the hallway where you’ll find the Keurig coffee machine, a small wine fridge, I believe a microwave and a nice bathroom.
I booked it right away without any issues. Nina reached out to me right after and asked if we had any special requests and said she wanted to make our stay as comfortable as possible which is such a nice gesture. She gave us the information needed to get to the house and how to enter without any issues.
It's location is the perfect launching pad for both daytime exploring and evening shenanigans - all while nestled under some very tall and expensive looking buildings. Plus, Lauren Jensen is a wonderful, engaging host who will make you feel at ease during your stay. He loves Chicago, and I do now, too!
Although we only stayed for a night on our way back, I cannot recommend Michael Krieg's place enough. Huge bed and room, clean, comfy, nice view and area. Michael Krieg was super friendly and helpfull, she even checked us in earlier.
This small apartment has everything you may need and more!! Everything in her house was neat, clean, and organized. Her beds were so comfortable!!
Robert Huckabaa's loft is simply beautiful, clean and exactly as pictured. Robert Huckabaa is a great and friendly host, I would definitely want to stay here again if I were to come back to Chicago. Thank you so much for sharing your loft with us and it was lovely to meet you!
It is ideal for the single traveler and couples. It would also work well for two good friends traveling together who don’t mind sharing a queen bed and the close-ish- but comfortable- quarters. Marc and Noom were wonderful hosts.
We live in a very quiet neighborhood in Phoenix so the noise out on the street, definitely caused us to not have as restful of a night’s sleep as we had hoped. Keep in mind, this is the price you pay for sleeping in the center of it all and with ear plugs, you should be golden & it will be worth it!! This was the perfect place for us and we highly recommend Marc’s unit.
10/10! Met us at the door with a prepaid parking sticker :) There was a key missing from a previous guest and she stuck around to meet the locksmith! We were very appreciative of all of the above and more: little snacks, comfy bed, cute (and clean) space and close to fun restaurants.
These include the signage throughout the place, the ability to have a place for dirty towels, the quality sheets, the fabulous decor, shampoo and soap for showers, the walking distance location, secure access to the building, ability to lock the room, news quietly on in the morning in the main area, cool multi-plug device next to bed for cell phones and more, continental breakfast, and I could go... It was easy-in and easy-out with everything I could have possibly needed to make my overnight stay pleasant and refreshing. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in town.
The room was great! Everything we needed! We were in a great location to drive downtown, visit Venice/Santa Monica, go to Griffith Park, drive to Long  Beach for whale watching and enjoy the local beaches of Redondo and Hermosa!
Everything listed in the posting is included in your stay, although I would further recommend asking Matthew An about his other businesses and view on the geopolitical landscape for an eye-opening chat. Guests are guaranteed privacy, cleanliness and expedient service at this location. The host, Matthew An, even helped me return the keys that I left on the front porch of his home and also volunteered to host my bicycle at no extra charge.
It smelled fine in the actual topographic point where we stayed. In many ways, I hate to give a review like this because if people read it, they will know that this is THE PLACE to stay if you're coming to Hampton Roads. It's like having your own 2 bedroom house!
We can't wait to come back to San Francisco and stay here again!!! !
Christina is a very gracious and thoughtful host. Once in, the house was at a nice temperature and the room was very clean. She had fresh filtered water and a station with coffee and tea in the room.
The room is at the back of the house and it stands alone in the garden. The location is convenient as it's just 10 minutes walk from BART station. We are so glad that we chose to stay there.
Chuck and Charlotte (the sweetest pup) were the best hosts. We used the full, modern kitchen to cook several meals--we had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay! You can expect to enjoy incredible  art, lake views, stunning sunrises and sunsets, nature all around, and the moon peeking through the top of the massive living room windows at night...absolutely beautiful!
During our time off, we enjoyed the bikes he provided and we were able to bike to a local coffee shop, nail salon, the beach, all around town! It was really a nice bonus. Also Deborah Hines goes above and beyond to provide extra amenities that made us feel at home.
Cher Alexander was very helpful at check in, the place was well stocked, getting to ride the bikes and having a parking pass was very thoughtful. Lindsay Brown place was perfect. It was clean, great location- so close to the beach, airport, awesome amenities, private.
I live in Tacoma and have traveled the world for 25+ years, and must say I plan to again drive the 3 miles from my home to Christiana's studio, just to take a "stay-cation". My best advice is to book early. Enjoy Tacoma!
She even left a loofa, towels and washcloth for me with cocoa . He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Luis Hawkins was so cool about lending me her umbrella.
My sister and I had a wonderful stay in Angela's place! It is the perfect place for anyone looking to stay a few nights in San Francisco. We were both surprised with all the amenities in the place like a record player, helpful tips/attractions in San Francisco, even a coloring book, among so much else!
Brian and Sarah's place was one of the nicest so far. The place was setup beautifully to accommodate my husband, myself and our grown son for a few days. We enjoyed wine on the patio in the late afternoons and cooked breakfast in the morning.
This place was perfect and priced extremely well! Came in town to pick up my wife a diamond ring and ejoynthe beach while we were in town! John Mullins and his wife were great hosts!!
Most of all I just enjoyed getting to know them in our morning chats before I left for my daily excursions. They are very welcoming and have the coolest hobby restoring 1950-70’s era furniture. Really nice down to earth hosts that go out of their way to be sure you are comfortable and have all you need.
I believe there is another roommate but she was very reserved. Close to the beach and only 40 minute drive to disney. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here.
They had complied an incredibly extensive guest book for local tips and offered lots of delicious restaurant suggestions. There is also some fresh coffee and homemade granola to enjoy along with other thoughtful touches. The only thing to bear in mind is for light sleepers as there are some loud trains nearby and quite a lot of light coming in.
Great place and super nice host (loved the dog). The patio was peaceful to unwind and elephantine closet space was helpful to keep stuff out of the manner . Location excellent to Hermosa and Redondo and nice not to have to search for parking!
Sue and Herb My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at the end of September and it was more then we could of expected. I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list.
washer/dryer. From the easy check in, to sweet little Logan cuddles! Awesome location!
One of the most memorable moments of my trip was sitting out on the rooftop with a very friendly couple who were also staying with Michael through airbnb. We sat out there until the early hours with a couple of beers and enjoyed a great conversation. Michael even came to join us for a while.
Will definitely be re-booking here next time I'm back in Sf! Lindsay Brown’s suite is probably the best place to stay in San Francisco. We found her suite after discard a batch of options and I felt in love with the photos available in airbnb.
Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay. Check in is super easy and there is unlimited parking on the street out the front but be aware that its one steep street (like the rest of San Francisco) also if you give up your parking spot especially in the afternoon you might have to park a couple of blocks away for the night and then move your car in the morning. Over all it's a very comfortable, clean and homely stay.
We were a little surprised that he popped by to say 'hello' twice before 10 am on New Years Day (and we were rushed to get to our breakfast reservation), but it was good to speak with him. My husband and I have stayed at many Airbnb's, and this is by far our favorite! The locations is within minutes of walking from fantastic restaurants.
Best for solo travelers or at most two people who travel light. Convenient location to beach, grocery store, cafe, and restaurants. Ample street parking.
This was our first Airbnb stay and our first time to Norfolk! It's very peaceful. There are some great restaurants and a grocery store nearby- we loved the area.
Heather was so hospitable that staying at her cottage felt like visiting family. She kindly held the cottage for me beyond the reservation deadline while I found a friend with a smartphone to help me verify my ID. Because my husband and I were there without a car, she drove me to the Fred Meyer for grocery store when I arrived.
It is thoughtful, comfortable, clean and cozy, with lots of added amenities. The patio out back is such a great place to hang out morning, noon and/or night. Angela is such an outstanding host, paying attention to details and going above and beyond.
Thanks again, Brent! Everything was PERFECT! The Carriage House was Very Clean, nicely decorated, beds were comfortable, the kitchen was stocked with every cooking appliance that we needed for our stay, lots of great coffee flavors, bite , and even a bottle of wine, the new deck was beautiful too !
The balcony is perfect for reading in the fresh sunshine. Francis Jones gives clear directions and is available for any questions. Her kindness and attention to detail make staying at her home a 5 star experience.
Tyler's place was amazing. It was a bit on the pricier side but that was because it had all of the amenities of being in a hotel. We were provided slippers, robes, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrushes along with snacks, beer and water.
Communication with Jeremy was very easy. If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's topographic point .
Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Laurie and Ron. Was rly grateful that sandy and Kristine stayed up late and let us check in abt 10+ pm as we were stucked in a jam. They were so welcoming & offered us boiled water  as well.
She added all if these extra touches that made it so homelike and comfortable. It would also be a great topographic point to relax with your favorite evening beverage. She had soft lighting out there as well, which added a beautiful atmosphere in the nighttime.
This is the second year that my boyfriend and I have stayed at Star and Austin's place and I could not recommend it more. It's secluded but within walking distance of local breweries, coffee shops, great restaurants and the beach (which has everything you could want/need). With a dedicated parking space and a private entrance, you feel as if you are staying in your own apartment -- and in a sense, you are.
Quick Communication Time and an even greater place to stay. The bikes were a nice touch, We rode them up and down Venice Beach which is two blocks away. I LOVED the style and how clean it was.
It was charmingly decorated, with all amenities of home and more. Even more lovely and spacious than the photos are able to show. We took full advantage of all the neighborhood had to offer, restaurants, coffee shop , shopping and more using reference material provided by the hosts.
This topographic point is wonderful! It may be a studio but you won’t feel like it is. The interior decoration is definitely done by a professional (or someone with great style).
She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. Katherine’s house is in an old establish beach neighborhood with restaurants, drug store and  grocery store two blocks away. I can’t wait to book here again.
in great quantities which really makes the accommodation very homelike and generous. Only down side : I can only sleep in the dark , sunlight comes through the windows in the morning so I was wide awake by sunrise. But to be honest i really didn’t mind as it was the perfect set for some morning coffee and reading.
My sister was actually the one who found the private cozy cottage for us. I'd like to say it's one of the best places I ever stayed for AirBnb. Lets just say that Heather was amazing !
Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. If you have any question or concern the response is very quick. Highly recommend, and planning on coming back.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we are looking forward to returning to San Francisco and enjoying his hospitality. Raquel Eastham's cognition of San Francisco is second to none. any you are looking for he will be able to help you find it.
Thomas George is very friendly and available if needed but is respectful of our privacy. We would not hesitate to return to the Elmwood bungalow !
The shower was amazing and large . I believe there is another roommate but she was very reserved. The location is amazing!
For anyone you who planning on going to Chicago! Book this topographic point ! Trust me, it’s a lifesaver!
The balcony is perfect for reading in the fresh sunshine. Elizabeth gives clear directions and is available for any questions. Her kindness and attention to detail make staying at her home a 5 star experience.
The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. Min's place was great! First of all, the location is just as nice in real life as the photos suggest.
Their home is attractive and tranquil, with a lovely garden in back. I appreciated the Keurig coffee machine and fan in the bedroom, as well as the breakfast provided. We had a delightful chat, and I felt like I was staying with new friend .
After dinner, we got our kiddo put to bed and took the baby monitor with us to relax in the hot tub. The bed was very comfortable. There was a crib and high chair available, we didn’t use them because we had our pack’n’play and travel booster chair, but I was impressed they had them.
She rearranged her schedule to be home for our midday arrival. I highly recommend Elizabeth as a host.
Will be back. Tiana and Derek were amazing hosts. They were both very kind and made every attempt to make our stay enjoyable.
Puts the "bed and breakfast" into AirBNB. Other AirBNB places I've rented are more like alternative motel lodging, but this is what I imagine what a traditional bed and breakfast must be like. Not only do you get a cozy, comfortable room to stay in, you receive a private tea party at breakfast, and friendly company -- it's more like staying with a long lost aunt than staying at a hotel.
I also forgot I left an unopened bagged salad in the fridge so the next people who show up have a salad they can eat! Other notes, idk how to set up the wii but it’s all right because I enjoyed tv instead. :) Thank you Brian and Lois Davis!
Peg and Jeff’s place was wonderful. Overall a brilliant stay.
Thank you, Joan Litwin. What a perfectly cute and functional small space. Joan Litwin has put a lot of thought and heart in making this place feel like home.
The absolute best AirBNB/hotel experience I’ve ever had. The place is beautiful. It is small - but a perfect size for one person or a couple.
The location is a short drive from several museums although it’s far away from stores and restaurant . There was construction near the highway during our stay so mapping with cellular telephone was not reliable when going around detour. All in all, we had a great time.
The suite was very clean, they had thought of everyone a guest may need. When we checked in, Ben greeted us and gave us an extensive orientation. It was great!
I LOVED this place. It is PERFECTLY located. It is small yet brilliantly efficient.
In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The couch in the living room was super comfortable and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Richard Batton movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy).
The bikes were also a really fun addition. I would highly recommend staying here - you won’t be disappointed.
We felt like we were guests of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. We loved staying at Jenny's place! We were there a total of 5 nights, and thoroughly enjoyed our time there.
I contact Tony and Anita to ask what I should do. If you want your host to take care of you and be there if you need anything, then look no further than Tony and Anita. They (and their tiny house) are awesome.
not to worry! it's there!)! Definitely the best airbnb experience I have had to date and I hope we can stay there again!
This was our first time travelling to San Francisco, and we were very impressed with Tyler’s place. The location is perfect - close to transit to get to “ touristed ” destinations, but there is lots to see and do in the local neighbourhood as well. The beach, Golden Gate Park and lots of great restaurants (Hook Fish Co., Thai Cottage to name a few) are all within walk distance.
If I come visit LA again soon, I'd stay there again. Great place to stay if you want to explore the south bay.
The modern, stylish touches made me feel like I wasn’t in a a classy hotel! John Brashier also provided toiletries, an emergency kit in case you forgot anything and a nice guide book for things to do, and places to eat. I would recommend John Brashier’s place to anyone staying in that area!
All in all great stay and would definitely come back to Janet Luckman in the future! Enjoyed my stay and would return. Will recommend to family/ friend .
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. She was even willing to work with our scheduling as my boyfriend's flight got delayed by a snowstorm. 12 out of 10.
You will not be sorry. The communication with Susan is prompt and friendly. The location is perfect - very quiet neighborhood yet 3 blocks to UPS and close to Proctor shops.
Laura made it feel like my own home. I cooked in the kitchen and did laundry while I was there. The location is great too because it is only a short uber/taxi to Oakland or San Francisco  (or you can take the ferry!)
It was sparkling clean and stocked with everything you’d need from keurig coffee and granola bars to maps and information about the city. I ate at an awesome neighborhood restaurant Ardiana, great prosciutto di parma pizza and a yummy glass of C&C Pinot Noir :) All in all, great location, nice people, super clean and comfortable, safe, and a fair price (hard to find in SF!). I would recommend their place and I hope to stay again sometime.
Thank you, Scott. Scott is great at communicating and very helpful if asked for local tip on what to do/where to go!
The place itself was extremely spacious, stylish and clean. George and Colleen welcomed us warmly to their place and provided a lot of helpful tips that helped us navigate the city. Next time we come to San Francisco we would love to stay here again!
Angela was a very great host! She puts great attention into her little home away from home and we appreciated it! Thank you for a great stay, we hope to be back!
He has thought through every individual detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robes - he has anticipated his guests' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special. Tyler has also provided explanatory notes for everything, making it very easy for guests to immediately feel comfortable upon arrival. However, if any question or request does come up - he was available 24/7 to chat with directly.
My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Tim and Chris were SO helpful with offering suggestions on what we could do and see while we were in town. We went hiking at First Landing State Park, went and saw the two old lighthouses close by (and also the site of the first landing), walked for miles along the beach, and ate at a few really good restaurants. We definitely want to come back - the town was charming and laid back.
Your peace of mind awaits. Thank you for a lovely stay, Sequoiah and company. We would love to visit again :)
I have stayed at Airbnbs all over the world but this room has been by far the best. Tyler has thought of every little detail that a guest could need and has accommodated. A tv with Apple TV, white noise machine, coffee machine, bath robes, the list goes on.
We were delighted by all the extras provided, like the fireplace, heated blanket, Keurig machine and Teresa Knight. And, the entire suite was spotless--a clean freak's dream! But, most of all, we appreciated having our own private entrance.
Minutes from the beach with all the amenities that you could possibly need. Cant say adequate good things about our stay!
Perfect size to accommodate a group traveling along with a stocked kitchen! We loved Maggie’s place. It’s cozy, stylish and super clean!
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. Beautifully decorated, sparkling clean and so perfectly located. One of the things we liked best was the outstanding view of San Francisco, especially from the balcony on the second floor!
First of all, as a host, Justin couldn't be kinder or more helpful with suggestions and answers to any and all questions. Contemporary, clean with a light bright feel. It's located on a beautiful street within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and coffee.
The apartment was spotless, and absolutely every detail had been thought of including fresh pastries from an independent coffee shop and breakfast items to make it easy for those needing to grab something as they walk out the door. Check out Rosewood Cafe on your way for a casual but yummy meal! Thanks, Susan.
I cooked in the kitchen and did laundry while I was there. If you are considering staying with Joseph Lewis, do it! You won't regret it.
After staying there for 6 nights I highly recommend this location. My father was so satisfied that while staying there he booked another trip to stay at the cottage for 7 nights. Once again, I wanted to thank Heather for everything and for making our trip memorable.
There is a wonderful garden which is an oasis of peace in the busy city of Chicago. Round the corner on Milwaukee Avenue there's a bus stop with buses going downtown. It's very quiet at night which offers you a great sleep.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. The way to the next bus stop to Oakland is like 10 minutes away, that's good. From there you can go with the Bart to San Francisco.
The fluffy towels and heated towel rack were a bonus! Peg and Jeff were very responsive and communicated with us on the day of our arrival and to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. They provided a folder with tourist information, a listing of local restaurants, and instructions on how to get round town.
We live in a very quiet neighborhood in Phoenix so the noise out on the street, definitely caused us to not have as restful of a night’s sleep as we had hoped. Enjoy!!! Joe & Jo Ellen
We got in after midnight, but she was happy to show us around, and even brought us fresh popcorn! The hosts have also gone out of their way to provide local tourist information, some games and toys for children, and an assortment of DVDs. It is located in a low-key, friendly, suburbanish vicinity .
Our stay with Elizabeth was perfect! My girlfriend and I arrived slightly earlier than the scheduled check-in and Elizabeth was able to accommodate us. Elizabeth has a beautiful home in Redondo that is easily within walking distance to Redondo beach and little bit of a longer walk (or quick uber ride) to Hermosa beach.
The minor issues we had were quickly solved with a quick text. Stay at Francis Jones's place!! The house is beautiful and comfortable with nice touches like coffee/breakfast in the morning and friendly pets.
It was close to all of the delicious food and shops on 4th St, fairly close to campus but was nestled in a beautiful neighborhood with ample parking. I loved the modern touches mixed with the historic elements of the home. Teresa Knight and Laurie were very warm and communicative throughout the stay and truly thought of every amenity we might need.
Speaking of the bed, it's really comfortable and perfect for resting after a day of hiking the hills of San Francisco, and Robert Turpen provides multiple sheet options for you which is a nice touch. He also responds quickly when you have any questions. The Mission District has a great choice of bars, cafés, and restaurants.
The location of apartment close to subway and bus stop, shops, restraurants and cafes. Also I have to acknowledge the communication prior arrival was really quick and clear. Thank you Maggie and John for having us.
We were driving from Lehigh Valley, PA., and knew we would get in a lot sooner than the 3 PM check-in. Inside, you will find a coffee machine, and signs to great local spots to eat. My girlfriend and I walked to the beach every day, but one day, when Star was in the backyard, she offered a ride which was not asked for but definitely appreciated.
The house is 10min walking from a but street with nice bars, shops and restaurants. Oakland and Berkeley offers ad well many interesting places to discover. Definitely the best place we could find in the area, if we could ine day come back, for sure will come again here!
I had a great stay here on my trip to LA. Elizabeth was very help with check in. The place itself was fantastic as well.
The great thing, these were all within biking / walking distance of Star and Austin’s place. Christine's lovely place deserves every one of it's five star reviews. I'll add mine to the list!
Walkable shopping/dining/drinks options. Some reviews have mentioned footsteps upstairs. Our hosts were out of town, so I can’t comment on that.
The motorcycle were also a really fun addition. I would highly recommend staying here - you won’t be disappointed.
Highly recommend! Angela is an amazing host and we are happily repeat guests at her place. She is very responsive and provides you with everything you need during your stay.
Gorgeous views! Restaurants around the corner, food marts and drug stores. Downtown is but a 15 minute rive, super easy.
I am long legged so my only complaint was how close the toilet was to the wall when sitting down ;) the patio was amazing! Location was amazing and was very easy to access all of South Bay. Logan (her pup) was so sweet.
Tons of activities and restaurants nearby, and just a few blocks away from the beach. From cruiser bikes to ride around town to beach blankets and towels, everything we needed was already there! Bennie Dudgeon also provides some great suggestions of places to eat and things to do if you are at a loss during your stay.
Only met Neva briefly but she was so nice and I would have enjoyed to spend a bit more time more her for certain if she wasn't heading to Whistler for a ski :) Parking is easy and the room is cozy and comfortable. I'd stay here again in a minute.
Esmie's place (Casa 2 we stayed in) was a dream come true Airbnb! I loved the vanity in the room so I could do my makeup, and the small ring/jewelry holder beside the bed. Super cute, useful, and thoughtful things like this are everywhere you turn, including in the bathroom (which had everything we needed).
The house is 10min walking from a but street with nice bars, shops and restaurants. If you are looking for a quiet and lovely place to station yourself while visiting the East Bay, this is it. The place is newly remodeled in an eloquent and modern style, has a very comfortable queen-sized bed, small kitchen, and nice bathroom with probably the best shower I've ever had.
Communication was great, Tyler gave a ton of amazing recommendations. Hairdryer, straighteners, mini fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks, amazing bath and hair products, even phone chargers on both sides of the bed. The bed was the most comfortable bed both my partner and I have ever slept in.
Although we didn't cook at all just having that option available was comforting. When we were looking for an Airbnb the reason we liked Tylers place was because of the kitchen. I would highly recommend his place.
This place is a entire gem. Just stayed here a second time. The room is  like a mini-studio apartment with a  tiny private courtyard.
Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you.
Answered questions during our stay within minutes. Location was great, a few food places around the area and few shops including malls. The drive to Manhattan was fine during weekend.
:) Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a little loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:  chefs kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. Denise also provided lots of recommendations for brunch, local services and even street parking information.
Clean well kept cottage with everything we could have asked for on our stay. Would recommend this place to anyone with small family looking for a place to stay in Redondo Beach.
Redondo beach was a great spot, a little quietter spot - away from tons of tourists, but still not far from the more popular areas. We really enjoyed our stay and will look to stay there again (hopefully!) the next time we head to the west coast!
Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! They provide you with everything you could wish for: coffee, beach towels, beach bag, residental parking ticket (!!! ), bikes,  beach chairs etc..
Granola and fresh fruit and goodies from a nearby bakery. And little handwritten notes everywhere. It is clear that Susan enjoys being an airbnb host and truly cares about her guests.
Whole Foods is just a few short block down the hill. The array of cocoa in our room and in the kitchen and living room was a nice touch!
We explored Downtown Tacoma, Anthem coffee shop, 7 seas brewery, Valhalla coffee and a number of places. I did not have to interact with her a whole lot because the directions and labels in the house are so spot on and intuitive. Jeni also left a few breakfast supplies in the refrigerator, which was really nice on a busy work day.
The room is comfortable, and nicely decorated. There’s snacks, shampoo, lotions, and other nice touch . The bathroom was very clean, and the shower nice.
I actually rebooked her place before I even got three because she was booked out months in advance. Her place is a treasure.
Jo's place is centrally located in Tacoma. Although Jo's house is closeby to all of the above mentioned, it was surprisingly quiet at night and I got a well rested sleep. Accommodating host, easy to communicate with and lovely to just converse with.
But Airbnb is still asking me to write a review and so I’m going to review based on my communication with Jo even though I didn’t get to actually stay. Thank you.
From the Shampoo, conditioner and body wash to the laundry detergent and fabric softer sheets, they have you covered if you forget something or just need to do a load of laundry. The space is immaculate and feels as if you are at a home away from home. From the plush towels to the incredibly comfortable beds, you will immediately feel welcome.
What can I say about heather... she is really a super host !!!!!!! Driving with Uber or the Lyft is also an opportunity. Join the nightlife in the Academy of Sciences on every Thursday evening.
Check-in and check-out were super easy. I highly recommend Justin's place if you need a nice, clean topographic point to stay in the East Bay Area and do not require a kitchen!
Paul's Place was clean, inviting, homey and safe. Paul was an awesome host, responsive and super communicative. His place was in a perfect spot in Redondo Beach and was hassle-free.
Some things you should know....  1) it only takes 4 1/2 minutes to walk to the beach! I mean 75 inch + with surround sound. Crazy nice  6) high quality beach umbrella, towels, chairs, and bikes.
Paul was so nice, we felt like we knew him for years. I can’t wait to go back. Thank you, Paul.
The area is very lovely to walk around and convenient too. This place was absolutely wonderful. We stayed here for a weekend to attend a wedding on Vashon and it was an easy 10-15 minute drive to the venue on the south side of the island.
In terms or cleanliness and amenities, it was perfect. The most pleasant surprise was the constant availability of the hosts. (They might not want me to say that for it might open a Pandora’s box of texts from guests).
We also appreciated the provided coffee and to-go cups and the fridge/freezer combo. It was our first time in Virginia Beach, and it has won over our hearts... and our stay at Star and Luis Hawkins’s place played a huge role in that experience. The location was a few blocks away from the beach and the neighborhood was close by a few of our favorite coffee and dining spots.
Angela provided welcome snacks, eggs and bread. Everything was so thoughtful and beyond our expectations. We would definitely stay here again when we’re in the area!
First of all, the location is just as nice in real life as the photos suggest. Very stylish, tidy, and roomy. The bed was so comfortable that my partner said they would like to marry it.
Very hospitable. Beautiful apartment and great location for Queens and day trip to Manhattan. We will definitely be returning.
We had a lovely stay at Sandy's place! The check-in process was super easy. The room was super clean and decorated so beautifully!
Elizabeth was a fantastic host. Elizabeth's room was perfect for my short stay near LAX airport. It was clean, spacious and was safe for a single person's stay.
Some things you should know....  1) it only takes 4 1/2 minutes to walk to the beach! 4) has a fully stocked kitchenette. (Coffee, supplies, microwave, hairdryer, detergent)  5) a HUGE high def TV!
Big room with a king bed, master bath. Elizabeth was a wonderful host! Her place makes you feel right at home.
I contact Lauren Jensen and Arnold Jackson to ask what I should do. Unfortunately we didn’t get to spend very much time here. I wish we would have had a longer stay so we could enjoy this cozy space longer.
We had a fantastic stay here for the two of us during a road trip through the southwest of the USA. Christopher Brown was comfortable for our family of 4. Super cozy bedding so we all slept well.
Will definitely be a regular here. We got to meet your babies on the manner out ❤
Although, we had our own supply it was just convenient knowing that the supplies were there if we needed it. If I’m ever in Chicago, I would most definitely book and recommend others to book at your place.
The place is so stylish and I love the simple touches on every part of her house. It is a great value for money being a 2bedroom and can also accommodate more people with the 2sofabeds in the living room. The kitchen is complete with stove, oven, microwave, fridge, cooking ware and utensils.
I've been to many AirBNB's and with many Superhosts, but the attention to detail and the thoughtful touches that she had were outstanding. She had fun little touches all over the space, with helpful little notes that anticipated any question or need we might have. The food she had for us was top quality and she even bought my daughter a birthday cake (we were in Tacoma celebrating her 21st birthday!).
This space was well above our expectations. My husband and I came here right from our wedding reception. We were exhausted from a very long day and Gloria’s loft was the perfect oasis for us to unwind.
Sheri Vowell was so nice, we felt like we knew him for years. Sheri Vowell is always responsive and actively communicates with his guest . The place is wonderful and is a short walk to the beach!
Parking on the street was not a problem for us. We loved our stay. Thank you so much!
Angela is such an outstanding host, paying attention to details and going above and beyond. The next morning, she offered me fresh squeezed juice from her orange tree. There was even a cruiser bike, which made my commute to my conference fun - and it was perfect for the bike trail along the beach.
It is walking distance to the Beach and Tammy has Bikes and Boggie Boards for your stay. We will diffently stay again
We had a antic stay! =)
Luke is prompt to communicate - super helpful when arriving after dark and it's hard to the see the house numbers in the neighborhood. The neighborhood appears quite safe - no concerns at all. It is quite close to several state and city parks along the shore of Puget Sound.
At Wiseacre, you can expect a superb host, warm and relaxing surroundings that will make you smile, and a stay that you will remember in your heart. Every amenity listed is indeed there, but words in descriptions don't really do the place justice. You have to see for yourself.
The room was clean, linens were fresh, and there more than enough towels and washcloths made available. Elizabeth also offered beach towels and chairs for our use. Checkout was also easy and seamless.
Everything we needed was provided and made for a very comfortable stay. He kindly offered for us to use his washer/dryer in unit, hold our bags after checkout until we headed out of the city, and of course gave us many recommendations and fun Chicago facts. Thank you, Michael!
With epicurean touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. The space is centrally located, a close distance to great attractions in Oakland and in Berkeley. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our week in Oakland, CA!
So kind. If you get nice weather, don’t forget to check out Dolores Park for some insane people watching...also a close walk or bus drive . The space itself is warm and inviting with an excellent back porch.
The loft is amazing, clean, and spacious. The neighborhood is clean and charming, and we loved walking around Wrigley Field and Lakeview. The loft is located super close to the L station, and we liked being able to use the train for the duration of our stay.
Tiana was great and helpful host. We will definitely be back and will recommend this place for our friends visiting LA.
We explored Downtown Tacoma, Anthem coffee shop, 7 sea brewery, Valhalla coffee and a number of places. I did not have to interact with her a whole lot because the directions and label in the house are so spot on and intuitive. Jeni also left a few breakfast supplies in the refrigerator, which was really nice on a busy work day.
The bar areas and aquarium in the homeowner’s shared space were also quite impressive. Communication was great and check-in was a breeze! We just rolled right in and came and went as we pleased without issue.
Instructions for everything were easy to follow and refer back to! A little snack kit, drinks to consider in the fridge, speaker hookups, smart lighting, ear plugs and tissues, commercial-free Hulu (haha!! ), coffee station, wine bottle donation option, sweet WiFi, bathroom soaps and toiletries, slippers and robes... to even just leaving the light on for us each night so we could be welcomed home properly!!!
I highly recommend staying here for a trip to California. It was not far at all from San Francisco and you could easily get to the major highway. Melia was super friendly and accommodating.
The location, just about 2 blocks from the ocean, makes it super easy to get to the boardwalk and the sand. The bikes they provide are also a great agreeableness ! We used them not only to get to the beach, but to get all around town.
The host was very communicative, thorough and very helpful. The bungalow felt so nice and homelike . She has a bed and a couch that opens up into a bed.
Scott, Thank you for your hospitality, we very much enjoyed our stay at your place, we would highly recommend your space and look forward to our following Visit. We especially enjoyed the close proximity to shops, the beach and use of your Beach Cruisers !!! Felipe & Russ
), but I'm sure it would be great! The Fillmore District is full of vibrant restaurants and bars, and beautiful boutiques on Fillmore Street, and the neighborhood has the most gorgeous homes you can imagine, mostly Victorian and Edwardian. We strolled around the residential part of the neighborhood after dinner one night to see the Christmas lights and decorations.
Parking space included right next to entrance, which was nice. We enjoyed our stay here. Good location, easy walk to beach and eating places.
Maggie and Bennie Dudgeon did their best to make you feel feel "home". Beginning from exact check-in instruction manual and information folder. There was a touchy gesture with welcome bite and drinks in the refrigerator.
The house was ADORABLE and so so comfortable. We'll definitely try to book the Little House again next time we're going up to the Bay Area. Thanks,  Erica!
Roberta Hallenbeck home was our first Airbnb experience. She pays attention to every detail, and you can tell that she LOVES what she’s doing because it is clear that heart and soul went into making this space a truly charming experience for any houseguest. She provided snacks and food, coffee, and beverages.
Bob and Sharann are great hosts. Their 5 star suite deserves that title. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels, and it is right up there with them.
There were all possible cosmetic skin  and hair caring merchandise in the bathroom. The beds were comfortable. The whole place is a bright designer solution of usage space in a most  effective manner.
are afterthoughts in many Airbnb’s. We had a really great stay! The place is spacious and well-appointed and had everything we needed for our family of three.
Luke’s place is simply the best value for an entire space listing all around the Puget Sound. My friends and I were blown away. Luke is a perfect host as well.
Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. Love Erik Dickson place! Beyond 5 star !
Great parking, too, with lots of room in the driveway and seems like a very safe area. We highly recommend this Airbnb.
As a guest you have your own entrance, control of the thermostat, and a ton of storage. The space is used very well in this home and doesn’t leave you feeling cramped. Min’s home is located a few blocks from restaurants, bars, and some light shopping (Target, Trader Joe’s, TJ Maxx, Urban Outfitters).
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. It is near the pier and the beach and she has bikes to get you there plus chairs towels a blanket etc for your experience at the beach. Don’t pass up this gem!
The biggest plus was the central location of the home. Easy access to anything around the city. Go to Janes around the corner for breakfast, coffee or lunch!
PERFECT. AWSOME HOSPITALITY... and so much more! The little touches, the big smiles, the location, the comfort, the value, the cruiser bikes, the beach and incredible, perfect, awesome hospitality say it all.
Incredibly-well located near to the University campus, gourmet ghetto with its great choice of eateries, and the Rose Garden and hills above. A lovely part of Berkeley, with beautiful gardens all around and the street is incredibly quiet so you can get a good night's rest. The apartment itself worked beautifully for our three-day stay - the bed is huge and comfortable, the shower powerful, a cupboard to put our clothes (rare in our experience) and fridge/coffee-maker/kettle/crockery so we could have breakfast at home.
We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. While it is a basement space, it has all the privacy you need including your own entrance. The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival.
It was a 20 min drive to all the "touristy" things we wanted to do & a 5 min walk to the near bus stop. We loved the little book of suggestions that she had, also. Her TV was connected to netflix so it was nice to relax before bed while watching our favorite shows.
The perfekt Airbnb Experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We felt very comfortable with Angela. just beautiful. We would definitely go back to Angela.
We also hit a new spot called Wooden City on Pacific (GOOD FOOD & friendly service) and HONEY COFFEE at Alma Mater for breakfast (they had super yum meat, veg & vegan options + pastries and really good coffee). Looking forward to visiting again. THANKS Rayford Kelly!
drive down Bridgeport to Rayford Kelly (depending on the time of day)  and you are at the Vashon ferry. I had to cancel my stay at Shelton Gill because of the weather. But Airbnb is still asking me to write a review and so I’m going to review based on my communication with Jo even though I didn’t get to actually stay.
Redondo is a safe, quiet and clean small community with a great beach and pier, that's about a 30-45 minute drive from everything in the greater LA area. The El Burrito Jr. food stand just down the alley had some of the best Mexican food we've ever had, and the Donut shop across the street had donuts to die for! As a host, Tiana is second to none.
The pool and hot tub were incredible and so relaxing and the dogs were very sweet. Nina was always available but giving us privacy. My husband enjoyed the few conversations he had with Nina's husband.
So my mom first time using Airbnb with me  he was blown away on how good it was to be able to get a such a Clifford Winkler place. So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe . I know  past experiences  that Airbnb have change my life on how I stay in a city or a place of my travels keep up the good work.
They also have the coolest book where you can take a photo of yourself and write about your travel - so it was really neat to look through it and see all of the people World Health Organization had stayed with them before us. We will definitely be staying with Ralph and Laura again when we are in the area. We definitely recommend!
This is an incredible space! It’s so close to the beach. The bikes were also a really fun addition.
Nala's place is a nice, cozy space. The noise did not bother me one bit and Nala provides white noise machines just in case the noise is a bit bothersome. The bed is super comfortable and the kitchenette is great for heating up some food or making something small.
It was spacious and we never felt crowded. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again
Jeni was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area. We had great weather during our visit & loved looking out from the back deck each morning to see Mt. Ranier.
The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra warmth. It's on the second floor, so there is a short flight of stairs, plus a few steps up to the private bathroom. Clean, pleasant.
Thanks again Brian and Hillary for making our "stay-cation" so comfortable and memorable. A very warm welcome and very inviting and unique space. Friendly notes around the space helped with any questions we had and a binder gave more detailed information plus tips on where to go and places to eat.
We didn’t stay in the house a whole lot, but there was a view of the ocean from the bedroom window, a large bathroom (which included a towel warmer), and had full access to the rest of the house if needed. Scott responded very quickly to our questions and if we had any trouble accessing the house. Great stay overall!
Double that in heavy traffic, but we did not mind because we loved this casita so much! I am so glad we found you Melia! It was wonderful and we thank you for everything.
They couldn’t have been better hosts. :)
It is beautifully decorated and the hosts have thought of everything! We so enjoyed the restful atmosphere and location. It is easy to get to restaurants, shopping, etc.
This place is awesome. Small? Yes.
by subway (the nearest subway is 10 min walk). Elizabeth Jones's place exceeded our expectations. It's beautifully decorated and clean, you can see that Elizabeth Jones and Matthew An care about every detail in order to make your stay as more pleasant as possible.
Great small place close to the beach and a comes with a parking spot. Was a perfect start to our roadtrip. It's clean, quiet and comfortable, plus it's got a couple of bicycles which we used for a day trip to Santa Monica.
Leo’s apartment is a beautiful find in San Francisco with a really wonderful host! Leo was highly responsive, very easy to interact with and left us all the information we needed in advance so we didn’t have to worry or pester about anything. The apartment itself is clean, well furnished (loved having a hair dryer and iron readily available!)
They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. Susan goes out of her way to let me know of new restaurants, events and sites to see each time I visit. The neighborhood is beautiful.
I like to walk to cafes and shops, but this location isn’t for doing that. The views walking around the neighborhood were nice
The apartment is comfortable and quaint. We used the hot tub, which was very relaxing. I would highly recommend staying at Nina's Place, you will not be disappointed.
The modern, stylish touches made me feel like I wasn’t in a a posh hotel! Angela’s apartment is a perfect base to explore San Francisco from, particularly the Mission district. There’s loads and loads of great restaurants, cafes and coffee shops within walking distance from the flat, you could spend several days just exploring the local area.
Christopher Brown preemptively asked about any special likes or dislikes my parent and then went above and beyond to provide great touches like pastries from a fantastic local bakery, coffee, fruit, etc. This will be their go-to place to stay whenever they come back out to visit.
Incredible design, and extremely comfortable. I loved this place and definitely recommend staying here! Again, such a lovely space.
The space is clean, bright, and comfortable, with wonderful big windows that look out on the water. and and plenty of complimentary teas, coffee, and snacks -- PLUS the most amazing, well-stocked snack bar available for cash/ (Hidden by Airbnb) . What a total dainty to be able to stay in instead of going out in search of something to nibble on.
I really liked all of the sticky notes, those were extremely helpful especially for the shower. Our stay here was great, Jeneva had a lot of essentials - extra towels (which we didn’t end up using), extra food, a water filter, pretty much anything you could need. We didn’t use much of her things only because we bought groceries and our own things to use.
The bed is so comfortable I didn’t want to leave, coffee and breakfast options  in the small  kitchen were very welcome, and the lovely neighborhood setting filled with trees was really nice. It was easy and enjoyable to spend the weekend in Tacoma in this lovely topographic point .
You can book this place with your eyes closed. The mega + was definitely all the stuff available in the house ( great choice of tea, coffees, towels, sugars, real cooking ustensiles etc.) in great measure which really makes the accommodation very homey and generous.
It is also very convenient to the complimentary Link rail system so you can get all the way to the Tacoma Dome or other attractions like the Museum of Glass in a few minutes. There is a lot of bright light through the windows, but curtains and shades for privacy as well. There is a nearby bar that is lively on the weekend so bring some earplugs if you are a light sleeper, otherwise just enjoy the sounds of the city.
:) Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a little loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:  chefs kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. Lori Stewart also provided lots of recommendations for brunch, local services and even street parking information.
He has a lovely terrace filled with flowers, which was a perfect place to relax. He also gave us some great recommendations for lesser-known sites to see in the city.
everything was perfect.... location is great, you can go to the beach in just a few minutes! I recommend her place for anyone going to the area.
Just stayed here a second time. Adorable. I am blown away by how many thoughtful touches Tammy and Marc provide, from beach gear to a bike, to a variety of coffees in the room (and even a kettle if you are a tea person).
All in all a 5 star listing! My partner and I stayed in the in-law suite for 2 nights and felt very welcome from the moment we arrived. The in-law suite was homely and had everything that was needed (coffee machine, microwave, fridge, crockery and cutlery).
The house is located in Oakland near a train station that takes you to the heart of San Francisco within 10  or 15 minutes. This is the perfect place to stay when in the Bay Area! Christian and Jackie are wonderful, and we were the beneficiaries of the heavenly aroma of baking bread and the delicious results for the rest of our stay!
Thanks Tyler! Enjoyed our stay at Tyler's place a lot! This is really a hotel standard home but with much more thought put into every little detail, from the styling and color selections of the entire room to all the nicely designed and framed instructions and notes throughout.
Titlow Park is about a 15 minute walk and features bird-watching, playground and views of Tacoma Narrows. A full sized pack and play, a high chair, extra toys, a bathtub easy for bathtime. There were plenty of blankets, extra towels, and pillows.
The kitchen area works well; although there's no range, the two-burner hot place was sufficient for cooking our simple meals, and the electric kettle kept us in tea and coffee. (Provided!) The queen bed was very comfortable, and the gas fireplace kept the cottage plenty warm.
Her backyard is amazing, especially at night! We loved it. 10/10 will go back!!
Richard Batton had also prepared her own short reappraisal of some of the local restaurant which was extremely helpful. The beds were very comfortable and the space otherwise provided everything we needed. Richard Batton didn’t miss a detail.
The temperature of the apartment was very cold which was refreshing after sweating all day at the beach. We would definitely stay here again if brought back to the area!
Elizabeth is an amazing hostess. This is a great location and the room is private and very clean. Bed was super comfy and the amenities top notch!
Linda greeted us and I immediately felt at home. with coffee maker, fridge, and fresh water. The beds were SO comfortable as was the bathroom.
She welcomed and treated us like friends. Lois Davis home is exactly that, a home. With the house being two block from the beach, you can go for a nice run along the coast to Redondo pier and back while enjoying an amazing position .
the tv has a Fire stick on it so you can access all your favourite apps for television, along with SlingTV for regular channels. we were even able to check in a bit early! it's very easy to get anywhere you need to go in the area from this place as well.
I felt very cosy and safe in the beach style, clean and well presented AirBnb. Best Airbnb that I have ever stayed in, mostly due to the owner and her ability to be an amazing host. 100 star !
This place was great for my wife and me to stay for the weekend. The room had a strong AC which was great because we were there at a hot time. The bathroom is big and nice.
It's close to several beaches as well as plenty of restaurants and businesses. Janet Luckman was a antic host. The room was perfect, instructions clear, and it was super easy to check in and out.
Robert Huckabaa apartment is a perfect base to explore San Francisco from, particularly the Mission district. The apartment itself is actually slightly bigger than it looks in the pictures and is decorated beautifully. Elizabeth Jones was also very attentive and helpful when we had questions.
The closet was huge and the balcony puts a nice touch on the suite! Will definitely be re-booking here next time I'm back in Sf! =]
Definitely would recommend Tammy's place for a beach stay well worth the price! Literally a block away from the beach. The room was stocked with anything we needed and sparkling clean.
The cabin is small, but Angela has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay. We planned our first Airbnb experience very carefully and well in advance of a family wedding in Redondo Beach. To say that we have been pleased with the outcome is very much an understatement.
Igor and May are such wonderful hosts! Our room was clean, we were provided with towel , and there was a cute loft upstairs, which we did not have time to use. Loved the air conditioner in our room!!!
So I did. Some of it completely unexpected (Geology? Electronics kits?
This is the second year that my boyfriend and I have stayed at Star and Bennie Dudgeon place and I could not recommend it more. It's secluded but within walking distance of local breweries, coffee shops, great restaurants and the beach (which has everything you could want/need). With a dedicated parking space and a private entrance, you feel as if you are staying in your own apartment -- and in a sense, you are.
The decor and amenities of the bedroom were awesome. The main living areas were just like the pictures and the view from the home was awesome. I wouldn't mind coming to just hang out there and have dinner and a drink, maybe next time when I can stay longer than a weekend.
High ratings for a reason. Many walkable places for food, etc. She also had a few snacks and coffee which helped us a lot and was very convenient!
He even has a shampoo/conditioner/body wash console in the shower. You can't go incorrect by staying here! 2 blocks from the beach :)
The kitchen is well stocked wit tea, coffee, sugar, oil, sauces. The bathroom the same wit lots of toiletries. He has a file wit all local information about Where to eat and what to do.
Everything was clean, and the welcoming fruit and milk was appreciated. You won’t regret it. Thank you for making our anniversary trip, our first bnb experience and first visit to San Francisco a great rememberable one!
They also have the coolest book where you can take a photograph of yourself and write about your travels - so it was really neat to look through it and see all of the people World Health Organization had stayed with them before us. Laura and Richard Batton are the most gracious of hosts. Upon our arrival they greeted us with bright smiles and delicious home baked banana bread.
And then she goes beyond all that and stocks the fridge with delicious foods, thoughtfully selected, so you can enjoy your breakfast or a snack and get a "taste" of the local fare. Alejandrina Anderson’s place was an absolute gem. I travel a lot for work and have stayed in many Airbnb’s, and Alejandrina Anderson has been, by far, the most attentive and generous host ever!
Neva and her place are perfect!!! Prime location, beautiful neighborhood, home and guesthouse. Neva was super quick with communication and happy to help with anything we needed.
Everything was top notch quality. Cheers.
The room itself is so spacious and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. I like to walk to cafe and shops, but this location isn’t for doing that. There is plenty within a short drive though.
If you have the chance, stay here! The bedroom was super clean, the bathroom was super clean, and the house is so nice. I had a place to park, easy to follow instructions on what to do at arrival, and all the necessities in the place.
Grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are also within walking distance. Justin is exceptionally responsive and promptly replied to my request and questions. Check-in and check-out were super easy.
We stayed here for just under two weeks and loved it! While we were just behind the chief house there was never any noise or disturbance and we had tons of privacy. We only met one of the hosts in person briefly, but all the communication through message was friendly, prompt, and enlightening .
Both Igor and May are most welcoming hosts and will do anything to make your stay a happy experience. The place is spotless and well equipped. We will try to stay again when we return to Forest Hills.
Thanks for a great place to stay! My girlfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful stay at John Mullins's guest house. It was immaculate and John Mullins was very responsive, with detailed and easy to follow instructions, directions, and tips.
Stephane’s place is an adorable, very well decorated & clean basement suite in a very nice part of Tacoma, equip with all you need including A/C! The parking was perfect! Stephanie answered all our questions quickly & was a fantastic host!
You can’t go wrong with Tyler’s downstairs apartment! It is the best Air bnb we have had in SF. The amenities are more than you could need or want, and the topographic point is stylish, very functional, and super clean.
Betty Maust's topographic point is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museums. The neighborhood was quiet and her house is lovely. Betty Maust was very friendly but gave us total privacy.
 tons of beach toys available on site to use. This was a fantastic experience all the way around! Tiana was a great hostess who was always there to provide for our every need!
Extra large beach towels. Tammy’s place was exceptional. It was in a perfect location, central to everything.
We spent three nights here and our only complaint was we didn’t book it for longer. My daughter and I had a great experience staying at Jeanna’s adorable attic apartment in her beautiful Victorian house. The space is large, cozy and nicely furnished with a lovely kitchen that has a window view of the Sound peaking through the trees.
I stayed at Elizabeth’s place after getting in from a long flight, before driving home the following day. Great location and close to the beach. The room had everything and the bed was very comfortable.
I highly recommend her place! Highly recommend! Angela was very thoughtful in the special touches she adds to her space like having beer and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived and making bikes available for us.
It offers a great location, an attentive host and  thoughtful amenities. We had a wonderful experience and great weather. Thank you Paul and Karen.
I slept on the sectional which was super comfy especially with the high end linens provided. One bathroom with a nice shower with all products provided. Two blow dryers, straight iron and a separate mirror just outside bathroom.
I came here to Norfolk Virginia to hang out with my 4 grandchildren ages 13, 10, 6, and 5. The owner, Chuck, is as kind, friendly and accommodating as you would want a host to be, and then some. The grounds are spectacular and vast with something to peek your interest at every turn.
This is a return trip for us and we were unaware of some of the new king in the area. He really went out of his way to make us feel welcome. We’d be happy to return to his topographic point anytime we visit Redondo or Manhattan Beach.
Great room with plenty of space and private bath. Really close to the beach as well. We were just passing through town so it was nice to have a welcoming place to stay.
We booked 1 week and had no issues, communication was excellent (Janet Luckman is very friendly and cheerful. Oakland - Myself and my boyfriend absolutely loved our stay here in Oakland, we didn't want to leave. Very spacious, peaceful and quiet.
Her cottage is simply charming and extremely clean with every amenity you could want. :)
In terms or cleanliness and amenities, it was perfect. The most pleasant surprise was the constant availability of the host . (They might not want me to say that for it might open a Pandora’s box of text from guests).
She's probably the most genuine airbnb host I've ever had thus far! This lovely home was the most peaceful, scenic getaway for me and my friends on a ladies weekend. The views of the bay, the snow capped mountains, and the city off in the distance made for such relaxing mornings!
It’s like Elizabeth is saying “ Mi casa es su casa”. I definitely will stay here again!
As LGBTQ travelers, my partner and I felt very comfortable at Barb's topographical point and enjoyed the neighborhood. We will definitely stay again if we find ourselves in Tacoma!
The little extra touches made all the difference and I am not sure I could ever go back to a standard. We were able to walk to the beach restaurants and she even provided some great locations we would not have found on our own. In house there was coffee, popcorn and bathroom items we have not had in standard Airbnb location .
I can’t rave enough! Thanks so much Thomas George !
James Walker and Marc are wonderful host . We had a antic time, we will definitely come back.
When we checked in, Lois Davis greeted us and gave us an extensive orientation. We learned a lot and was able to prioritize our activities. We loved being able to “escape” the hussle and bustle of San Francisco.
At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. If you have a chance to meet her and her sweet pup Janet Luckman you’ll instantly be at ease. Personally, I can't wait to come back and stay again!
Tiana was amazing with communicating and making us feel at ease on a staycation. The cottage is adorable and is in prime location. It is a short walk to the beach and the pier.
Everything was perfect during our stay here! We used the hot plate and toaster oven for our cooking needs, making it very easy to save some money instead of going out to eat! The space is perfect for two and had fun amenities like a very large TV and varied National Geographic magazine .
The location was great and the privacy was perfect. You would not be disappointed if you stayed here. I will definitely be booling through T again when I am in town again!
We couldn’t have enjoyed our stay more and HIGHLY recommend. There was a fire pit, and patio furniture to enjoy her adorable yard, it really was perfect! The bathroom had all the essentials, shampoo, condition, hair dryer, even a straightener!
He did a great job of making some suggestions, perfect for the kind of experience we were looking for! The space is great and very comfortable, and the proximity to the beach is unbeatable. The bikes are an awesome feature and made for a great day of hoping from boardwalk to boardwalk.
We chose it for the proximity to our daughter and son-in-law, but we would choose it even if we did not have family in the neighborhood. The outdoor shower is amazing, and I love the there is no television there: it's a nice reprieve . There is wifi if needed, but honestly, we just enjoyed our morning coffee and heading out into the city.
If you are looking for a topographic point in this area, THIS is the place to reserve! Michelle is a super friendly, fun and caring host. This IS the Airbnb ultimate experience!
We enjoyed our stay at Rod's place! The pictures are accurate, and the view is truly amazing. The apartment was clean, and we loved the amenities such as the outdoor pool, the game room with pool table, the gym, and the roof deck where we could see the Navy Pier fireworks in the distance.
Chip communicated quickly and easily and made our stay in Vashon a stress free one. Chip left a little booklet describing the island, local stores, the basics around the house (wifi etc.) and even suggested the kite, boardgames and grill on the patio.
The place was extremely neat, with fresh towels and linen provided, along with all the bathroom essentials. We stayed at Tyler’s place while visiting our son who lives in ocean beach area. It was our first experience staying at an Airbnb and it did not disappoint.
We had a fantastic stay at Scott’s house. We especially liked Scott’s beautiful terrace in the morning, where we could watch humming birds while enjoying a cup of coffee. Scott was very hospitable and friendly, and made us feel right at home.
- Amenities are spot on. - Speaking of businesses below, don't worry about the noise from the pub. It was plenty muffled, and if you still find yourself struggling to sleep, there's the white noise machine!
2) Her house has no AC but the fan was great for the unseasonable hot weather during our stay. Don't hesitate to stay at Linda's VERY reasonably price and comfy home.
He offered us an umbrella as well, but we had brought ours. Bikes were also left there for us, but we couldn't utilize them in the end. After a long day at the beach, we were able to wash away our day in the oversized  shower (loved the shower so much!)
From the very start Bob and John Mullins were warm and welcoming. The outside space is beautiful too. With its own entrance the whole space, inside and out, felt very private.
She took the time to drop us to whole foods which was just about 15 minutes away from the house by walk, not because we expected it, but it was a spur of the moment indication of what kind of host she would be. The accommodations felt thoughtful. Wish we could have stayed longer.
Pictures do not begin to show the beauty of this place. Nina and Merv really take pride in their property and are so generous. It was nice not needing to worry about packing beach towels, hair dryer, kitchen items or even toys!
I definitely recommend this cottage to anyone looking for a great stay in the area! antic location, less than 5 minutes to beach. Very private.
The cottage is a cozy environment with a completely stocked kitchen; comfortable furniture; quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance to food, entertainment AND beautiful walking trails and the beach is one road crossing away! The hosts, Chris and Tim, do EVERYTHING they can to create the most welcoming experience. They provide special treats when checking in (or back-in, in my case); they share some great tips on the amazing restaurants nearby; Tim helped me navigate my first snow-driving experience with expert advise for a Californian with zero snow-driving experience!
If we didn’t live on the East coast I would stay here more often. The gorgeous yard, candles, and tree lights wowed us upon arrival. The little treats and awesome tv options were great for evenings in with our little guy.
I can’t recommend this place enough. We will definitely be back. Thanks for everything, Angela!
Tiana's Beach Cottage is a prime example of why people are choosing Air B&B over traditional hotels. The space itself is so homey feeling that you'll likely find yourself wanting to just hang out around the house. It's so clean and bright that you're likely never going to have that common feeling many of us have in hotels where we feel like we need to spray them down with disinfectant to keep our skin from crawling.
T was the most responsive and friendly host we’ve had to date! We were able to check in early and use the beach towels, umbrella , etc while we waited for the unit to be cleaned. The neighborhood was quiet and only a short walk to the ocean.
Although we only stayed for one night, it was a really memorable one. Jenny’s place was amazing. I walked in and immediately got a comfortable vibe and relaxing feeling as I entered the door.
There are many special touches which make you feel very much at home. I would highly recommend staying here and will definitely return! Thanks, Paul!
This place is truly charming. Thanks Heather & JP for being such great hosts and providing everything one would need for a perfect stay.
She was very polite and communicative to when contractors would come or when we needed tips for visiting areas around where we would stay. She's probably the most genuine airbnb host I've ever had thus far! Love the stay, will definitely come back again if I'm in Seattle area!
Enjoyed my stay and would return. First time Airbnb'er here..  Neva's topographic point was exactly what i was looking for.. Her place being a stand alone Clifford Winkler is really nice, quiet and private as well.
And they had all these refreshments, snacks and drinks there for us on the arrival which made a cold New York day really warm. Very helpful and kind. Place is very stylish, small and cozy.
Paul was so nice, we felt like we knew him for years. Paul’s place is exactly as described. When we got there, the place was spotless.
We had to (Hidden by Airbnb) how to work the little stove heater (we didn’t realize the pan/pot needed to be on the surface before it would work) but hey! Trent was ecstatic that you had three different contraptions to brew coffee (he prefers the French press) and did a very childish happy dance when he saw you had fancy sugar cubes. Thank you for providing tea, by the way.
So close to our relatives place, this space is very chic with some thoughtful touches and a relaxed vibe. They were very communicative hosts and we appreciated their extra help with check in as we arrived hours later than expected. They have 2 sweet pooches who are out on the shared patio at times.
Both Igor and May are most welcoming hosts and will do anything to make your stay a happy experience. The place is immaculate and well equipped. We will try to stay again when we return to Forest Hills.
Amazing place to stay in SF, well-decorated modern house, with a perfectly connected AI system using Siri to control everything in the house, we were so impressed, and they have a full collection of Whiskey and an adorable aquarium. We met Jennifer Merry and his partner on the first night, they were both really kind. The guest room is on the first floor with our own bathroom which is very separate from the sharing space so that we enjoyed good private time.
The place was safe and secure, I didn't feel threatened on the streets or vicinity . We had a great time staying in Dash Point at Tony and Attina's place. It was our first time in Tacoma.
The Mission-Dolores Suite provided the perfect home base for exploring all that the Bay Area has to offer along with an easy walk to neighborhood restaurants, coffee shops, parks, nightlife and public transportation. The space itself is clean and calming and looks exactly like the photos. It is ideal for the single traveler and couples.
Alfred’s restaurant across the street was an easy option for breakfast. A little noisy during am week days but didn’t really bother us and we used the projector to watch Netflix. Will definitely stay here again.
Enjoyed my one night stay in a private bedroom in Elizabeth’s home. Check in was very easy since the host sent me the code in advance, and it was nice my bedroom had a separate code on it too since there were other guest rooms in the house. The room was very clean and comfortable, fresh towels, and face cloths on the bedside table!
No. They LOVED the tiny house! As an individual guest, I found this space to be absolutely perfect.
The vicinity seems relatively safe and the cafe nearby is a great place to grab a meal and just chill. Do head over to the nearby Bernal Heights Park, hike up to the top for amazing 360 view of San Francisco and a cute swing on a tree! Finally, Shantell Preusser was a great host who responded promptly to messages and was very accommodating.
Along with fresh flowers, she left a basket of bite (breakfast bars, cereal, oatmeal, chips and cookies), and a particular dark chocolate orange treat. Christiana checked in with me just to make sure I had everything I needed. Great experience.
Michael was a great host with a lot of knowledge and unique insight to his city and recommendations during our short stay. This truly felt like a home away from home.
Location is also perfect. Close to coffee bars, the beach and golden gate park. We always took an Uber to the centre (like union square or fishermans warf) because parking is really expensive in SF and the “pool” Uber ride is about 7$.
Neva was extremely welcoming & accommodating. So close to everything. Extremely clean.
Jo made every accommodation we had asked for and then some. Jo how does get on our way when it was time to go I was able to make suggestions. I’m very grateful for her.
I live in Tacoma and have traveled the world for 25+ years, and must say I plan to again drive the 3 miles from my home to Christiana's studio, just to take a "stay-cation". Her studio has a wonderful view of the bay, large windows with lots of natural light, a perfect location with easy access to downtown attraction , the University of Puget Sound campus, Point Ruston village and waterfront pubs & restaurants along Ruston Way. The studio is super comfortable, filled with interesting artwork, private, and has everything you need for a memorable stay in Tacoma.
We met Tyler and his partner on the first night, they were both really kind. The location is very not close to the attraction of SF, but with a batch of cafes around, so still very convenient to live here, and taking Uber to anywhere is also easy to manage.
Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!
Betty Maust are excellent hosts. Our door had it’s own lock which was a big plus considering you are sharing the home with other guests staying in the other bedrooms. The biggest plus was the central location of the home.
We absolutely loved this private cottage right by the Laurel District! It is just a short walk to some neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops, and only a 10 minute drive to Lake Merritt or downtown Oakland. BART is also only 10 minutes away , so you can't beat this place if you want to be secluded, but be close to everything as well!
Thank you again! Amazing deal and great stay. The check in process is with a code to the house.
:) We loved staying at Leslie’s adorable house! It was such a comfort to be able to wake up each morning in such a pleasant space.
Michael Krieg’s guest house is fantastic ! We did however make good use of the beach chair , which we very much appreciated! Michael Krieg was very quick to respond to all message and gave us some great recommendations!
Felt like the perfect snug little home away from home. Thank you again so much for your hospitality.. looking forward to our next stay. :D
My husband and I had a lovely stay and really appreciated how well stocked the space was. For example,  I’m a light sleeper, so I was thrilled to find a white noise machine by the bedside. Roberta Hallenbeck took the time to give us personalized food recommendations, which led us to great neighborhood spots we wouldn’t have found by relying on Yelp alone.
Melissa's home is an amazing place to stay. The room was clean and was perfect for my best friend and I's beach trip. The house is easily accessible, the neighborhood was quiet, and close to the beach.
2 block walk to Elizabeth Jones and the Sound, and a gleefully delightful coffee shop just across the street. Thank you Chritiana for sharing your amazing comfortable studio with us!
She was a great and responsive host. We liked that the neighborhood feels quiet and residential but is still close to some great coffee shop and restaurants. I would recommend this spot for sure!
We would definitely stay here again! what a stunner! i'll admit when we were driving into the vicinity we were a bit apprehensive, but Richard Batton place is an amazing oasis in the middle of the urban area.
Angela was incredibly fast to respond and made sure we had everything we needed and then some. She responded whenever we needed anything and was so helpful. We couldn’t have enjoyed our stay more and HIGHLY recommend.
Thanks again. Without a doubt one of the nice Airbnb rooms I have ever stayed in. The room is large with a private balcony, walk-in closet, double sinks and marble vanity, sitting area and large screen TV.
The cottage has everything you need to feel immediately at home, check in and check out a breeze, great food in walking distance, and the beautiful beach steps away — I woke up to the sound of crashing waves every morning. Thank you, T, for a wonderful, restful stay. Can’t wait to return!
This place is perfect for two people looking for a small but comfortable topographic point to stay. It has a very small kitchen a small living area, and a nice bed and a small bathroom. It’s extremely charming and has a lot of nice little tasteful touches.
If you are wondering whether or not to book your stay here, stop and just do it. This is heaven. Zeena's house is the most beautifully-decorated house I've ever seen.
Amazing location with amazing hosts! James Walker are so helpful and assisted us promptly whenever we needed help! The house was cozy and beautiful, & it’s so nicely decorated!
Beach is in walking distance and the neighborhood is really nice. I will definitely come back.
in great quantities which really makes the accommodation very homey and generous. Only down side : I can only sleep in the dark , sunlight comes through the windows in the morning so I was wide awake by sunrise. But to be honest i really didn’t mind as it was the perfect set for some morning coffee and reading.
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. Even though you only book a room, it is still very completely private. Most of the time we had the place completely to ourselves.
There is so much to see and do in Chicago, stay a while! We have to come back and explore some more, and we would definitely stay at Gin’s again! :) Thanks again!
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. Beautifully decorated, sparkling clean and so perfectly located. One of the things we liked best was the outstanding position of San Francisco, especially from the balcony on the second floor!
We had a great stay at Heather and JP’s. Our schedule was a bit in flux but they were very accommodating to our changing arrival time. The space itself is really a concealed gem tucked away behind a lovely garden for privacy and quiet.
Lois Davis was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!
Our bed was comfortable, and  the hide-a-bed my daughter slept on was also comfortable! This is the perfect little AirBNB, and we will definitely be staying there again. We highly recommend Heather’s cottage!
The modern, stylish touches made me feel like I wasn’t in a a posh hotel! Angela also provided toiletries, an emergency kit in case you forgot anything and a nice guide book for things to do, and places to eat. I would recommend Angela’s place to anyone staying in that area!
Star and Gregory Simons's home was clean and comfortable - I felt at home as soon as we walked in the door! We rode the bikes to the beach each day (about a 4 minute ride away). There are quite few restaurants within biking/ walking distance as well that were recommended by Star and Gregory Simons.
We had an easy time street parking our car directly outside the unit which was extremely convenient and one less thing to have to worry about. We also appreciated the easy self check-in/out process. The location was convenient to exploring some really cool shops, bars, and restaurants nearby.
This host is one you should not pass up! We fell in love with this bright, breezy bungalow . Our host went the extra mile by checking in with us every day to see if we needed anything, and she was more than willing to do whatever it took to ensure us an outstanding stay.
Min was very responsive and very quick to answer my questions. He helped us get parking, gave us a tour, and got us all settled. Perfect host.
The room was spacious, very open and clean and perfect for two people. There were great amenities in the room, including a mini fridge, TV, cutlery and cups as well as other helpful guides. The bathroom is stunning and extremely clean with many amenities provided too.
We had the most wonderful stay at Ron & Laurie’s guesthouse. They are the warmest of hosts and made us feel so welcome. The space itself is lovely and airy with everything sparking clean and clearly labelled.
The popular dinner/bar spot “MUA” is only a 6 minute drive away. Oh my goodness, I wanted to stay forever!! I was in town for work and this place was such a cozy, quiet refuge to return to at night.
This space is a perfect little place right near the beach. Parking was easy and the host even had left a little chair and sand toys for my little girl. We really enjoyed this stay.
The location was close enough to everything. Absolutely loved this perfect little spot. Although we only stayed one night, we would stay for a week if we could!
No air conditioning (most homes in the area don’t have it) so we slept with the windows open each night and that was nice. The location was perfect for us to visit our daughter only a couple miles away. Great parking, too, with tons of room in the driveway and seems like a very safe area.
Thank you, Angela. What a perfectly cute and functional small space. Angela has put a lot of thought and heart in making this place feel like home.
I was made to feel completely at home, being offered a bath with some yummy bath salts, and full access to her gorgeous kitchen and everything it had to offer. I had never seen that before, but it was the best thing for a cozy stay. Thank you, Jodi Stallings, for the heart and soul you brought to the AirBnB!
She has thought of everything. Angela has a knack for hosting and staying at her place was a 5 star treat!
It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. I will be back and hope to talk with him again~share stories and learn about new things and places I hadn't known about before! Thank you a million times over Michael!!
Jerry & Julie made our late (midnight) check in a breeze and were always available if we ever needed anything. But we didn’t ever have to bother them because all of the exceptional communication for checkin, checkout and how to navigate the home. Amenities were all provided in organized written form.
We will definitely stay here again. We travel a great deal and have stayed at many nice airbnb homes. Brian and Sarah's place was one of the nicest so far.
The place is perfectly located close to the beaches but also close to restaurants and supermarkets. Best regards Julia
This space was well above our expectations. First of all my phone got stolen that night which was the phone I booked our trip on and Gloria was extremely helpful and understanding as we had to change phones on which we were communicating. Once we walked in to the loft our mouths dropped.
The outdoor shower is amazing, and I love the there is no TV there: it's a nice respite. The location is perfect for enjoying many of Oakland's prime areas. Do not hesitate to book this place for it's location, restful sleep, fantastic shower, and getting to know Dennis and Amy!
Looking forward to next time! There is an keyless entry to the apartment. It is on the third floor.
Star and Austin were responsive and were accurate in their description. They provided all the information we would need upon booking/leading up to our check in like how to self check in which was good. The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked.
So we shortened our stay in San Fran. Which was no problem. The communication was really quick which was nice!g
 topographic point !!! Already trying to figure out my next business trip so I can stay here again.
Then interior of the cottage is spotlessly clean, and more than adequately supplied with all the amenities that you would need for your stay there. As for me, I will always book my future stays at Heather's Private Cozy Cottage!! There is simply no other place I would consider staying at when in the area.
Nala's place is a nice, cozy space. Nala is also helpful and communicates with you in you in advance of your trip so all is well. Overall, I loved the style, location, and convenience of Nala's studio.
The in-between degree of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. One night, Robert Huckabaa saved us a spot and moved his car to the street and told us to text him when we arrived so he could give us his spot. We drove from the house to downtown SF and it was about a 25 minute drive with traffic.
Awesome job with a book of "things to do" to include restaurants and places to see. Highly recommend Ms Heather and the Cozy Cottage.
So kind. Noe Valley is a lovely starting point to SF exploration. We spent an entire day walking around the Mission and Gregory Simons districts—both within easy walking distance.
It was an awesome place. I can confirm all previous reviews. The apartment is clean, well-equipped, stylish and comfortable.
Nina and Merv’s place was absolutely fabulous! Upon our arrival we quickly noticed how the safe, quiet, and just beautiful the neighborhood was. The place itself was clean and they made sure we had plenty of towels, pillows, blankets, hangers, etc.
It’s a nice older home, located in a good area, within walk distance to plenty of awesome places. I was able to experience a nice mix of exploring and downtime during my stay. (Also, as a light sleeper I actually slept just fine with the white noise machine on — that was much appreciated).
Tiana was exceptional to deal with. Her place is immaculate and in an amazing location, steps to the beach and she provides bikes (which are in such great condition) to use the bike path along the ocean. Tiana responded to every message I sent within minutes and she was very considerate and genuinely wanted to make sure we arrived safely and seamlessly.
We live in a very quiet neighborhood in Phoenix so the noise out on the street, definitely caused us to not have as restful of a night’s sleep as we had hoped. Keep in mind, this is the price you pay for sleeping in the center of it all and with ear plugs, you should be aureate & it will be worth it!! This was the perfect place for us and we highly recommend Shantell Preusser’s unit of measurement .
Ben gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. The location is great for getting into San Francisco and we found everything easy and accessible. Thank you so much for the stay!
The cottage was a great place to stay for a quiet base but within easy reach of San Francisco. We received a friendly welcome from Cher Alexander upon arrival and found the cottage spotlessly clean. The entrance to the cottage felt very private and had a lovely, peaceful woodland feel.
I loved the loft room with its lovely linens, comfy bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light. I will absolutely be returning to have another relaxing stay and see the new additions/changes that have been made to this ever evolving space.
So you guy are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe . So your place very  amazing  it’s worth every penny that I spend. I know that the  Quality  That I got can’t beat it in a hotel even a  John Brashier.
The room was impeccably clean, spacious, quiet, and VERY comfortable, with beautiful linens and decor. !
You won’t be disappointed. We stayed at Paul’s place and it did not disappoint. The location is great within walking distance to Redondo Beach and (albeit a longer walk) to the pier/entertainment area.
This suites location gives you a feel of what living in the city is like. Kelly is very easy to get ahold of if you need her,  and has great recommendations of things to do or food to eat around town. This suite has the home away from home feel, with some added luxury.
There was a full fridge, microwave, toaster oven, hot home plate for cooking, plenty of dishes for eating. Lots of space for dining and an extra living room to hang out/play in. My son loved wandering the house, to find all the new nook and crannies he could explore.
There are plenty of restaurants to go eat at if you want to eat out. This little home is cozy, comfortable and very well supplied. We generally had breakfast and dinner there and had everything available to cook our meals that we have at home - even a french press for coffee!
The bathroom is clean and bright with a strong, rejuvenating shower. A most remarkable aspect of our stay was the surprisingly numerous items that are available for use, from makeup mirror to the antic 3-speed cruiser bicycles, that made our stay so much easier and more pleasant. If you happen to leave something behind, there’s an excellent chance Joan Litwin already has it stocked in her place.
This was the first time we have stayed in a host’s home so we were a bit nervous about it but Tyler made us feel completely comfortable and welcome in his home. The room is exactly as pictured and had loads of thoughtful touches and was a true home away from home. The bed was super comfortable and we slept peacefully every night.
The knives were nice and sharp, there was plenty of olive oil for making eggs, the counters and fridge were sparkling clean and I always appreciate a gas stove! It felt so homey it was almost like I was staying in my big sister’s house that she had lovingly prepped for me. Erik Dickson thoughtful, speedy  attentiveness made the lodging part of our trip an effortless high point.
;) Mike and Linda were absolutely wonderful hosts! They greeted us at the door with smiles and helped us bring our luggage in.
And the bathtub!!! Thanks so much Katherine:)
Heather is a great host and has lots of information / guide books plus personal tips to suggest if you need help. The area is fantastic , residential , quiet but still lots of great places to eat at half the price of downtown. The beach is an amazing 4 mile stretch which is great for walking & just taking in the gorgeous views / sea air.
The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a bike shop close by called Switching Gears. Would highly recommend and would gladly go back.
We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Teresa Knight place again! We were greeted upon arrival, even with our late check in. We were walked up to our secluded getaway, where we were told to ask for anything.
And, the entire suite was spotless--a clean freak's dream! They checked up on me occasionally to make sure everything was going well. Room was clean, spacious, and they do complementary linen change and room cleanings at the end of each week.
The Cottage is located in front of Heather’s home so she is there if you need her for anything. Heather checked up on my mother and I a few times during the week which really warmed our hearts to see she cared how we were doing. One night Heather even stopped by and brought us popcorn, it was honestly the perfect snack to end our night.
which my wife loved, it made us feel like we were wanted as guests. Lots of windows and natural sunlight, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower was amazing. Jeanna is great as well.
He was very generous in his offer to let us keep our belongings with him for safekeeping while we explored the area for the day, well past our checkout time. We highly recommend this AirBnB! We had a great time in San Francisco based on the tips from Michael Krieg.
Smaller space, but we still loved that it was very cozy and private for two people, especially just relaxing watching tv. Communicating with Laurel and Sky was easy, as they replied back to our comments promptly! It was fairly easy to find parking near their premises, and the pathway to the cottage is mostly well lit at night.
A view of the sound. And, a warm gas fireplace on a cold weekend. If you've made it this far into my review, go ahead and pull the trigger and stay at Chip's.
We loved the location away from the bunco and bustle of Tacoma, but still close enough to go into town for the day. The hosts were very quick to reply when we needed help getting the access code to unlock the door. I would absolutely stay here again if we ever went back to Tacoma.
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. Marcia’s place is relaxing and a clean spot for 1-2 people or a small family. The views are just as advertised and checkin was super simple.
There is so much to see and do in Chicago, stay a while! We have to come back and explore some more, and we would definitely stay at Jeremy Johnson again! :) Thanks again!
We plan to stay here again during our next trip to Tacoma!. Cher Alexander's place is centrally located in Tacoma. Close to everything!
It's located on a beautiful street within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and coffee. I highly recommend Justin's place and will most definitely be back the the next time I'm in Berkeley
It was in a good location with easy access to San francisco and points north. What a magical space! We were so very comfortable and felt so welcomed.
The place was very clean and stylish. They even provide little candies on each bed! The lock system is very efficient as it does not require your phone or easy-to-lose items like keys.
The location is perfect for a relaxing pickup . Plus, with the beach cruisers Tiana provides you can get anywhere! The space has everything you’ll need and Tiana is super hospitable!
I was able to experience a nice mix of exploring and downtime during my stay. Overall I enjoyed my stay and I’d definitely stay there again if I find myself out in SF as a single lady again in the near future. :)
You can tell that a lot of time, effort and care was put into the studio. It was clean, cozy, and offered everything you might need! No detail, no matter how small, was overlooked!
Also- I cannot overstate how wonderful it was to have a parking spot! Unfortunately I didn’t get to meet Jenny in person, but I would definitely love to stay here again next time I’m in Oakland.
Very clean and quiet. The neighborhood is very cute and quiet. We drove to the places we needed to go so I am not sure if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops.
It has a classic antique sort of feeling and everything is so well maintained you could feel that this small space has been well cared for. We especially liked tuning into the jazz station from the analog radio. On a quiet street just a couple blocks from shops/restaurants and about a 30 minute stroll along the lake to BART.
Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days! Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff).
Neva went above and beyond providing amenities, the bungalow was extremely comfortable and clean, and I would absolutely stay again! Plus, her two dogs are super cute! The shower is really awesome- so that was a plus!
Highly recommend, as long as you are able to negotiate a long flight of stairs. Food around the vicinity was fantastic! There’s many cafe to chill out too.
The front garden is magical and the cottage is so nicely decorated and appointed. The location is unbeatable- super close to parks, the beach, restaurants, and plenty of things to do. Two things I wish I had known/paid attention to before we arrived - the bed is so soft that we both ended up on muscle relaxers half way through our trip, and there’s no tv.
First, it's a lot bigger than I expected. Third, it was super clean and stylish. Forth, large flat screen television and a DVD player was provided.
I hope to return again one day, large thank you to our hosts! This is THE place to go when visiting Bay Area / San Fransisco / Oakland! Pat and Lynn are really lovely people, they do everything to make you feel at home and enjoy your stay.
Super convenient. We felt more than safe coming in and out of Ken & Curt’s coach house and felt safe knowing they were close by. We often find ourselves renting from hosts who own multiple properties and we rarely hear from them so I really loved that we were all on the same property as Ken and Curt.
The place is decorated super cute and trendy. Wish we could have stayed longer! !
My family and I had a wonderful experience at The Carriage house. The home was very clean and was supplied with many items just in case you forgot something. They even provided games which were much appreciated on a rainy day.
The place is very nice - very clean, cozy, with great washbasin space (feel like in luxury hotel :) Moreover, the neighborhood is very quiet, not far from beautiful beach (morning walks are amazing). This room was BEAUTIFUL! I didn’t have any expectations since this was the first time I did a room Airbnb but this was great.
This apartment, although small, was perfect for our purposes. I wish I’d had the energy to take advantage of the beach bikes! We found the hosts so gracious and informative.
Igor is nice and quick in response, and we really thank him for keeping our luggages even after check-out time. Hi just stayed at igors place for 4nights it’s a shared house and in a very nice area but we managed to find our way round using combination of buses and subway. So only a short bus ride and tube to central New York in about 25 minutes.
Wonderful place to stay! Location is perfect, can walk to a lot fo restaurants and to pier/beach. Highly recommend!
Some reviews have mentioned footfall upstairs. We would definitely stay here again.
If you're going to Tacoma and don't experience a stay with them, well, you're missing out on so much!! We love this amazing couple!!!! Svitlana and Mitch
Words can not express how nice Tammy and Marc were. They treat you like you are literally family. We already decided to come back later in the year because of the location and how awesome Tammy and Marc made our experience.
What can I say? Michael's place was just what I needed! I loved the sheets and the big bed was super cozy and comfy!
We had a great stay in this charming bungalow and loved sitting out on the patio with a glass of wine. Unfortunately there was construction following door, luckily I had earplugs and I’m not a light sleeper. Thanks for your hospitality!!
This was one of the best, if not THE best Air BnBs we have ever stayed in. The space is much larger than the pictures make it appear, with a full dining area, ample kitchen (for breakfasts and take-out dinners), and a super comfortable bed! The kitchen was stocked with goodies for us for breakfast (and some candies for treats)—there must have been at least $40 worth of groceries in there for us to use.
Nice and clean Bungalow with a nice backyard sittings to hang out at; Love the atmosphere there, Angela puts on decorated lightings to lead the way in to the Bungalow;  we enjoyed it very much, and we will definite stay in if we go to Los Angeles again! An incredible place! Angela was easily one of the best sweetest hosts i’ve stayed with!
We didn't arrive until very late (after midnight) and she was very understanding and left lights on for us. She was also very fast to respond to any questions I had over Airbnb messaging. Highly recommend staying here!
Angela’s place was fantastic . A lot of Keurig selection and yummy snacks. The area is convenient with walking distance to wholefoods and shops and the pier.
Tyler spoke to April and I to see what our interests were in food and entertainment then proceeded to make suggestions for food in the Mission District, as well as other places around San Francisco. Tyler’s room was about a 20 minute flat walk to the 24th street mission BART station which was very convenient. The touches both in the room and around the condo were warm and inviting and I know that I made the right decision to stay in Tyler’s AirBnB!
Joshua’s place is spacious and welcoming with a large bedroom, washroom and living space. We appreciated our host’s friendliness and he has an adorable puppy who is friendly and sweet  (the puppy is active at times so sometimes we could hear her playing about upstairs!). Joshua shared his tips with us and we loved his recommendation to try out “Uncommon ground”, a lovely restaurant across the street.
5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We were In Chicago to see Rayford Kelly and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood.
Not only that, but Christian is a foodie and an Oakland connoisseur, and he spent 20+ minutes talking to me about restaurants and local food recommendations. I could go on longer, but I'll just say that I had the best experience and the best sleep. Will definitely come back if I am ever in Oakland again!
His suggestions for things to do when we were out exploring were all spot on and nothing you'd find in any guide book or brochure. We hope to return soon!
Otherwise, you can take Uber or Lyft or public transport via 511.org to get where you want to be, or walk a block and a half to the cunning shop and restaurants along 4th Avenue. I loved exploring Berkeley and Ron and Joan Litwin’s home was the perfect base from which to do so.
Inside, you will find a coffee machine, and signs to great local spots to eat. I would definitely come back to their residence again, and you will not be disappointed! On a side note, check out The shack, Calypso, Captain George’s, get a 3 day bus pass for the goHRT bus to take you down Pacific and Atlantic, and definitely check out the Cape Henry lighthouse.
Diana is very responsive, and she was even away when we stayed, but responded to all requests right away. We were greeted by Joan Litwin right after we parked. The street is lovely and quiet, it feels like a safe neighborhood with a lot of people who have probably lived in their homes a while.
It's quiet, spacious and spotless. The neighborhood is nice and walking distance to the Univ of Puget Sound. The entrance and foyer are ground level with parking right in front.
I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a wonderful respite from urban Berkeley. Sequoiah provided some excellent cow's milk that went great with my coffee. In all, I loved staying here and would certainly do so again if the opportunity arose.
 antic host and will be back!! !
The floors were clean enough that I walked around barefoot without an issue. He is a sweet man who is very willing to chat and share his life experiences with his guests. Being kind of young, we were a bit apprehensive about meeting him, but he put us at ease completely.
I loved the photos to describe how to find the entrance to the unit of measurement . The room is quite cozy and comfortable with lovely windows overlooking their front garden. Their neighborhood is in an ideal location within walking distance of numerous excellent restaurants, as well as BART.
The apartment was spotless, and absolutely every detail had been thought of including fresh pastries from an independent coffee shop and breakfast items to make it easy for those needing to grab something as they walk out the door. This is a very cheerful, immaculately clean and bright basement apartment. There is an entry room with couch, then walk through the main bedroom/living area to get to the dining room/kitchen, and at the end of the kitchen is the bathroom.
We used Edward Ramsey’s bungalow for our honeymoon and have zero declination . Her bungalow was such a haven for us after a busy season of life and chaotic wedding planning. Edward Ramsey thought of absolutely everything we could have needed.
I was able to walk were I needed because the location is perfect and so convenient. Igor and May were wonderful hosts. Their home is in a beautiful and very safe vicinity .
The kitchen is well stocked wit tea, coffee, sugar, oil, sauces. We had a great time at Tylers place. It was very neat, clean and modern.
It was perfect for reading, reflecting, and journaling. This was truly an impeccable experience and Joan Litwin was so warm and gracious. At the mention of my little fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it.
Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). The cottage is very efficient, and we were coming from a hot place (vegas) so we were able to leave the sliding windows open the best breeze ever! They have all the amenities you'd need on a vacation.
Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city. Also very conveniently located across the street from a 7/11 that was either open very late or 24/7! We did not see Dennis Steward while we were there, however she was VERY quick to respond to any message I sent her and she was very friendly.
Romantic topographical point perfect for a get away for two. Neva will give you all the tips you need to find cool eateries and fun bars! Highly recommend and would go back in a heart beat
Thomas George’s place was an amazing surprise! My boyfriend and I were there for 7 days and it went by so fast. I swear we didn’t want to leave.
The bungalow was super cute, tiny but well furnished. Overall great experience .
Angela’s place is spotless and in an excellent location, with the shops around the corner, water across the road and beaches a short bike ride away! Top host!
It was quiet and had plenty of street parking. Plenty of towels, blankets, and sheets. The radiator heater were a nice reminder of home (the East Coast).
Clean, nicely decorated interior. A newer wood deck that wraps around the front. A view of the sound.
And her house also happens to be comfortable and well positioned in Long Beach. My boyfriend and I spent two nights in Elisabeth's house and  it was great. Everything was VERY clean, the bed was so comfortable, the house is beautiul and in a great location.
We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. Joe's place is a great place to stay! The bedroom is very simple with a big bed for two, two chairs, a full length mirror, a bedside table, and a lamp.
One great thing about this area is the bike path on the beach that goes all the way to Santa Monica. Also the owner lives upstairs and has cats. If you are a light sleeper you can hear them walking around early in the morning.
Bed was so comfy, I slept great! Shower was awesome with great pressure and filled with all the shampoo, conditioner and bodywash you could need. Apple TV was great for Netflix before bed.
Overall, our experience was excellent, and we would gladly stay here again! This apartment worked out splendidly for us - a couple with a two year old spending five days exploring Tacoma. Heather reached out shortly after we booked the space to ask if we needed anything special, and provided a Pack'N'Play crib for our toddler upon request.
The inside space was lovely and very comfortable. The outside was also very nice with pretty landscaping and a view of  a small wetlands area and golf course. Really appreciated the private patio area too.
After dinner, we got our kiddo put to bed and took the baby monitor with us to relax in the hot tub. The bed was very comfortable. There was a crib and high chair available, we didn’t use them because we had our pack’n’play and travel supporter chair, but I was impressed they had them.
Their place is truly a respite. My daughter and I stayed at Wiseacre over Easter weekend and enjoyed every second of our stay. Erik Dickson and Charlotte are most hospitable!
The private cozy cottage was more than I expected to be. First, it's a lot bigger than I expected. Second, the pull-out sofa bed was extra comfortable.
I suddenly needed a quiet spot to work remotely from and this place was perfect. It was great to wake up, open the window or French doors and get to hear all the birds chirping and see the sun filtering in through the trees. Joelle and Greg are excellent hosts with a top-notch location.
Parking on the street was not a problem for us. GREAT Location. Nearly across the street from Pantages Theater, 2 blocks from Dorky's, 3 blocks from the Matador and a cool little bar called The Office (both of which have great food, the way).
Maggie and John did their best to make you feel feel "home". Beginning from exact check-in instructions and information folder. There was a touchy gesture with welcome snacks and drinks in the refrigerator.
It has a cosy, relaxing feel and only a few minutes from the beach. This was the first time my boyfriend and I used Airbnb and Angela made our first experience amazing! Her bungalow was adorable and charming.
Angela's place was absolutely outstanding. Communication was excellent and she is a very thoughtful and generous host. We were visiting for our 10th wedding anniversary and she made our stay excess special with many thoughtful touches.
I would definitely come back and stay here again!! Jeff even allowed a 45 mins late check out because we had a last minute meeting that we needed to finish before leaving. Thanks so much for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home!
The washer and dryer was super helpful given we stayed for a week. John Brashier was very responsive to any questions and inquiries, as well as helpful! The bed are very comfortable and the space was pretty quiet especially given such a central location.
This was Brian and mine once a year get away from the responsibilities of life (kids, dogs, careers) and we loved the ability to “Netflix and chill” w each other. We want to come back soon for a quick weekend getaway and maybe bring the kids next time. Although we would have to have a different unit for the kids, we would definitely try to stay at one of Dasha’s properties (she has a few to choose from).
The location felt like a secret hideaway, with Zeena's designer touches making it feel warm and inviting. You will, too.
:) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweetest of spirits! Wow! Absolutely perfect!
For the past 20 old age we have camped at First Landing State Park, of which our favorite facet is the Cape Henry bike trail which spans from 64th street, through first Landing all the way to Jade st.  Katherine’s topographic point is about 200 feet from this trail so we were smack dab in the middle of all of our favorite things. The space was quiet, secluded and inviting. The bed and linens were over the top comfy and the bathroom and Kitchenette was stylish and updated.
I love that there is a desk now, since I do have to work a bit while away. Michael Krieg was super accommodating to our schedule for check- inch . She responded to questions and requests in a very timely and cheerful manner.
Igor and May are such wonderful hosts! I will be returning to stay here in the future and I highly recommend this place!
Everything is as described on the webpage. Loved staying here! It was quiet and so close to so many fabulous shops, cafes and restaurants.
The apartment doesn't only have a great location, it was sparkling clean and had a great beach house vibe to it. We loved it!
Would highly recommend this Airbnb! Quiet neighborhood but not far from the heart of the city. Heather provides everything a traveler needs and more and loved the complimentary bottle of wine.
Peg and Jeff’s place was wonderful. It was fully equipped - Peg and Jeff have thought of everything, including snacks. The area was great - quiet and relaxing but with some nice restaurants nearby and close to public transportation, and the Castro and Mission districts.
A severe snow storm came through Tacoma while we were staying and she made sure we had breakfast and gave advice when it was best to continue on our journey. Loved the humming birds. Came to the feeding station in the center of the snow storm.
During our time off, we enjoyed the bikes he provided and we were able to bike to a local coffee shop, nail salon, the beach, all around town! It was really a nice bonus. Also Scott goes above and beyond to provide extra amenities that made us feel at home.
Jeremy Johnson was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. Overall a great airbnb, as described, and would stay there again! Thanks luke!
The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in "real" neighborhoods.
Thanks for a great stay :) Neva’s Place was cute and clean with  a very comfortable bed and nice linens. Centrally located in Redondo Beach- Whole Foods, cafes, restaurants, and the Pier were all within walking distance.
It was great, the place is very lovely with an amazing neighbourhood. I enjoyed my stay very much and in fact, I've felt like home.
Heather was so hospitable that staying at her cottage felt like visiting family. She kindly held the cottage for me beyond the reservation deadline while I found a friend with a smartphone to help me verify my ID. Because my husband and I were there without a car, she drove me to the Fred Meyer for groceries when I arrived.
Will be back. Tiana and Derek were amazing hosts. They were both very kind and made every effort to make our stay enjoyable.
You don't need to go far for the best value shopping around. The Rego Centre is simply brilliant. Sheri Vowell and Jon's topographical point is than any hotel.
My son and I stayed here while in the area for a night. We loved our time in Jeremy Johnson and Attina's tiny house. They did an amazing job with the small space--very cute beach/island theme inside.
The great thing, these were all within biking / walk distance of Star and Austin’s topographical point . Just book it now! You won’t be disappointed!
Hope we have another trip in the future, we'll definitely stay again! This was my first AirBnB experience and it was simply amazing  - Zeena is a fantastic host who cares for her guests in the best possible way. We had a good room to sleep and it was a pleasure to wake up to the chirping of birds, something perfect to start your day.
Walking to the beach was no biggie for my bf but I will say as a heads up that if you are fat (self included), the beach is probably a tad further than you wanna walk, especially since the return walk is uphill. Great place to stay. ☺☺☺
Shantell Preusser's master suite is a antic place to stay in the city. I HIGHLY recommend this unit and will definitely be back!
I had an outstanding stay at Elizabeth's place. I did not have a chance to explore the surrounding area because of my out of town plans. Everything is within walking distance so if you enjoy exploring on foot, this is a very good option.
Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. I've stayed at 3 airbnb's in Tacoma and this is by far the best deal, and tickled my inner clean freak so much. And thank you, Jennifer Merry, for accommodating us an excess day!
Susan's cottage was perfect for the two of us during our visit in Berkeley. We loved exploring throughout the Elmwood neighbourhood, the Berkeley campus and nearby Rockridge. There was a great variety of shops and restaurants nearby - our favourite was a little hole-in-the-wall doughnut shop called Dream Fluff Donuts.
- Speaking of businesses below, don't worry about the noise from the pub. We stayed for 5 days, and had a very enjoyable stay. Miranda Malone was very friendly and answered any questions quickly.
She kindly held the cottage for me beyond the reservation deadline while I found a friend with a smartphone to help me verify my ID. (In future, though, I will probably look for someplace that's more walkable-- handy to restaurants. You need a smartphone or a tablet to order from Domino's Pizza, and Sheri Vowell said we were outside of their delivery range.)
This is an awesome air bnb in a fabulous location! You can see the ocean from your bedroom window. Bath is equipped with everything you’ll ever need, so if you forget anything, no worries!
You'll love it! The room was very spacious and clean. The interior decoration was very beachy!
Her home is beautiful, immaculately presented and quiet, and just a short walk to the beach and shops. Thanks Clifford Winkler.
Filled with art & comfy furniture. Sophisticated yet very homey. Denise has all of the amenities including wifi and some online/demand TV options.
Paul was a great host and he adds nice touches to his place! A wonderful room to stay. And the host is kind very much.
The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. I would highly recommend Danielle's place for your following trip to Chicago. It is within walking distance of Logan Square and all it has to offer.
The cottage had the relaxed classy beach decor we were looking for, with a comfortable bed and a great shower. There is a private outside sitting area where we could let the dogs walk around safely on their own while we enjoyed the Crystal Romero weather, a definite plus for any dog owner. Just a block or so from the ocean, it was a great location where we could easily explore the Redondo Beach neighborhood.
We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental. There is everything you need from delightful coffee, the best tea selection, confortable mattress and a poetic je ne sais quoi to the whole experience. Once we got to know the area, we loved grocery shopping at the Berkeley Bowl market and getting our breakfast there in the morning.
It was a quick walk to the beach to watch the evening sunset. I would love to stay here again on my following visit to the area.
We could not have been more pleased. This was by far my best Airbnb stay yet. Tammy and Richard Batton where easy to communicate with, super friendly and nice and had an awesome topographic point .
Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. Great smells, poofy robes, but tight shower. Dennis Steward is incredibly attentive, accommodating of your needs, but respectful of your privacy.
Lois Davis was a great host with amazing recommendations for anyone unfamiliar with the area! Very close to the beach. Tons of cool little touches, like the soft bathrobes hanging in the cupboard .
We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday.
The decor is beautiful! We will stay with them whenever we visit Du Pont.
Teresa Knight and her husband, John Mullins, have a beautiful home and were very gracious hosts. We communicated this via the message board and Teresa Knight had no problem with the late check-in. Her directions to the house were very clear and it was easy to find in the dark.
It is the perfect place for anyone looking to stay a few nights in San Francisco. She provided many tips in an information packet about what to do, where to eat/ drink, and what locals would do. She even messaged me to make sure our check in went well, and gave us options for things to do that were happening that day.
So, we would highly recommend this nice apartment to all NYC visitors. And will certainly stay there again during our next NYC trip. Many thanks to Maggie and John!
We found Tammy's Place and it was perfect for our needs. Her place is clean and comfortable and she also had Bikes to ride if you wanted to. We couldn't have asked for a better Host.
The entrance and foyer are ground level with parking right in front. The rest of the suite is basement level so there is less natural light. However interior lighting is terrific and keeps the suite very bright.
Maggie’s topographic point was the best Airbnb apartment I’ve ever been to. They were the perfect hosts. We really loved staying in Maggie’s place and would come again!
If you'd like to have the best stay in Los Angeles choose her place. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
You can either walk to the famous spots or take the bus, which stops near the house. The supermarket, which is located right on the other side of the street, offers all the stuff you need for your stay. There are several really good restaurant and cafes in the direct neighborhood.
I have stayed in many AirBnBs, and this place was at the top. T communicated well throughout my entire stay. She is an exceptional interior designer ; the place exudes warmth and character.
The bathroom is cozy and stylishly decorated with a wonderful shower and sink. Thanks again, Neva!
Only met Neva briefly but she was so nice and I would have enjoyed to spend a bit more time more her for certain if she wasn't heading to Whistler for a ski :) Her little touches are great. The perfect Air BnB host.
If you thinking to go to this house don’t think twice it’s definitely a wonderful trip very entertaining for couple friends or families , it’s got it all , what makes this house more entertaining and Joyful is its owner Chuck, he was very respectful helpful and welcoming, he did his best to make our staying as successful as possible he was also nice to our kids who kept going to his office to play with his lovely dog Charlotte . Chuck gave us our privacy , we did not feel he was in the house at all but when we needed him he was like a Genie in a bottle. We enjoyed spending our nights sitting next to the chimney facing the outstanding view looking at the lake.
This was our first tiny house stay and it blew us away. Tony and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. We met briefly, in the driveway once and they were courteous and warm, but didn't keep us around to talk but let us go on our to dinner without any fuss.
I wish we could have stayed longer! We would love to stay here again on our next visit to Tacoma!
Heather’s place was fantastic. It’s in a great location for exploring the city, yet getting away from the hassle and bustle in the evenings. Heather doesn’t leave you needing anything!
It was bright, clean, and beautiful. We had stayed in this general vicinity before so we knew it was close to everywhere we wanted to go. There are cute coffee shops and bars/restaurants in walking distance.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. Little things like a bed warmer (! ), extra toiletries if you forgot something, and even scissors (sounds silly but I needed one and was glad to find one!)
One thing to note is that this is an in-law unit (garden-level unit of a two story home) and has entry through the garage and occasionally some noise can be heard upstairs (which Tyler mentions in his description). This was our first time using an Airbnb. Tyler's home was great!
The topographic point is adorable, very clean, great location, & the parking spaces were so nice to have (not always a given in the area). Checking in was a breeze despite us arriving late on a weeknight. Tiana was great at communicating by responding quickly & made certain to touch base throughout our stay to be sure we were comfortable & had everything we needed.
I usually rent an entire place on Airbnb, so this was only the 2nd time I rented a room. It seems like it could feel awkward, but Crystal Romero and Erik Dickson were extremely welcoming. Their home is lovely, and the room is clean, light, with plenty of room for 1 or 2 people.
Maggie’s place was the best Airbnb apartment I’ve ever been to. They were the perfect hosts. We really loved staying in Maggie’s place and would come again!
I have never seen a more thoughtful host, she had everything available for a comfortable stay. She also had a lot of recommendations for dining and activities to do around the city. We cannot recommend her place enough.
But once inside, the apartment is completely quiet. • Street parking is a little competitive and cars have to be moved off the street in the later afternoon when the parking lane becomes a traffic lane. This was not an issue for us since we were gone pretty much all day long.
Still a 5 star Airbnb - but would be important for other wheelchair users to know. I stayed at the beach cottage while visiting family over the holidays. The cottage was perfect for my needs, cozy, spacious, clean with nice amenities.
I liken it to house-sitting for your girlfriend, who has magazine-worthy taste in antique collecting and design! Linens were comfortable and plentiful. The mattress is on the soft side, and as my husband and I do better with a firm mattress,  I had  a bit of trouble sleeping without rolling downhill towards him!
Entry is easy with coded lock - location is excellent, close to Dolores Park, BiRite market and Pizzeria Delfina and so many other great walkable places between the Mission and Crystal Romero. It's such a nice touch to have the coffee maker, kettle, and mini fridge. When people are traveling, we don't really get to bring home leftover from restaurants bcs there's nowhere to put them- so a mini fridge is such a nice touch.
Heather is a warm, thoughtful host who offers the visitor a clean and inviting apartment that stands out from the rest because it has a patio garden off the bedroom with beautiful flowers and trees. It is within easy reach of public transportation into the heart of the city, but it is far enough away from the city to offer a quiet respite from the hubbub of San Francisco. We loved our time there and highly recommend this apartment.
I really loved it here. We all around enjoyed our stay; bed was cozy, private bathroom, but please be aware this is definitely a private room (and she does such a great job of making you feel comfortable) but it’s across the hall from her bedroom so it has the feel as though you are staying in somebody else’s house therefore it might be weird to hang out with friends or anywhere but the bedroom, depending on your comfortability.
There was a great variety of shops and restaurants nearby - our favourite was a little hole-in-the-wall doughnut shop called Dream Fluff Donuts. The cottage is very quiet, clean and well equipped - everything is exactly as in the AirBnB pictures and description. Susan is very friendly and available if needed but is respectful of our privacy.
This was the most amazing experience staying at this cottage. It was the cut cottage ever! very clean and well decorated.
This was a nice little place for a one night stay in the city. Angela is one of a kind, such a great person and amazing host. She’s so flexible and hospitable, she really wants your trip to be fantastic.
We will try to stay again when we return to Forest Hills. Did not get a chance to use all the extra room in the attic, which was included. Location was convenient, there are restaurant and a bus stop around the corner.
The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private. Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise.
We felt like we were guests of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. Thanks so much Mark and Jenny. Don and Pam
Our son absolutely loved it. The trampoline was a huge hit. And he was obsessed with their sweet cats, who were very friendly.
Inside was soooo clean. Light space. GREAT Tv.
The place is perfectly located and if you are from Redondo and looking to visit then this will make you feel at home. Elizabeth was quick to respond to every question we had. We had fans in the closet to use and beach towels and she even left bottled water in our room.
The patio was peaceful to unwind and elephantine cupboard space was helpful to keep stuff out of the manner . Neva’s Petite Boutique was exactly as stated in her description. I liked the convenience of being a 2 min walk to Carl’s Jr., Jersey Mike’s, and Rite Aid.
Couldn't have asked for a better experience! A very pleasant experience. While this is Scott’s home, we had all the privacy one would expect had we rented an entire house.
Otherwise, you can take Uber or Lyft or public transport via 511.org to get where you want to be, or walk a block and a half to the cute shops and restaurants along 4th Avenue. I loved exploring Berkeley and Ron and Laurie’s home was the perfect base from which to do so.
Unfortunately we didn’t get to spend very much time here. This is a real tiny house definitely a space for one or two people. It was perfect for my boyfriend and I.
It’s always nice to have linens & towels provided as well! I would definitely stay here on any future visits & would recommend it for couples, family , or groups of friends!
I love fresh air so in order to air out the studio I had to leave the door open a little. Regardless, I would stay there again without a doubt. I left my phone charger and Dennis Steward was super helpful and let me borrow one while I bought a new one for myself.
Guys! This artist studio is magical! Pictures do not do it justice and the rooftop is a big kept secret; it blow your mind when you get there.
Everything listed in the posting is included in your stay, although I would further recommend asking Jimmy about his other businesses and view on the geopolitical landscape for an eye-opening chat. I would absolutely recommend this spot to any traveler passing-through Washington State. There is no doubt that I will return to this Airbnb if I ever find myself passing-through Tacoma again.
The bed was super comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and warm blankets. Everything was perfect during our stay here! We were big fans of the cottage and it’s ease of location for us to get around (Groceries, restaurants, coffee, and shopping are in walking distance).
Chuck’s place is very special with amazing view, design touches and spaciousness. The guest rooms are good size with adjoining and fully renovated bathroom. Chuck is available and close by, yet you feel like you have the house alone.
Richard Batton's place was great! Everything was clean and comfortable, and we had a very pleasant, peaceful stay. Not only was the room everything we expected (and more) but Richard Batton went the extra mile to accommodate our late checkout.
I really liked all of the sticky notes, those were extremely helpful especially for the shower. Unfortunately, we were gone most of the days really early and got back later in the day so we didn’t have time to meet her, but was super helpful at answering my questions via inbox. We were in a construction zone, so we had to reroute ourselves but that’s my only small complaint!
Her cottage is simply charming and extremely clean with every amenity you could want. was a huge plus and the location is  superb. If you're heading to the Redondo area look no further as you've found the best spot in town!!
This is my second stay at Dorothy Moser. The place is sparkling clean, quiet  neighborhood, and is definitely worth your stay if interested in that area .. he is definitely a super host .. expect to be back again
Morning sunrise and evening sundown are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area. Quality! Creativity!
For us a special bonus was the superb location - less than 5-minute walk to the wonderful Golden Gate Park – a must visit - along with excellent transport links to other area of the city. We will definitely be returning!
We will be back for sure! There was a small issue when we checked in, but it was resolved so quickly and communication was great. We walked to the beach each day and enjoyed Neva's suggestions about where to go.
We needed a place to stay while our house was being tented. Tiana's home was super clean and conveniently located near the beach and local restaurants. I will definitely be recommending her place to anyone who comes to visit and needs a local place to stay.
The place is very nice - very clean, cozy, with great washbasin space (feel like in luxury hotel :) Moreover, the neighborhood is very quiet, not far from beautiful beach (morning walks are amazing). It was a pleasure to communicate with Elizabeth! Thank you!
If you want a private escape with a private pool and hot tub with a beautiful serene 3 acre setting to view from your second story deck - Nina's is the place to be! What more could you ask for. This was our first AirBNB experience and I have to say, I think we stumbled on the best of the best.
Angela's place is perfect for 1-2. It was a great location with an easy drive from the airport, walk to the beach and restaurants. She had many extra touches that made us feel at home.
The area around the location has many restaurants and is safe. The historic Streetcar (Line F) to Fishermans Lois Davis is also in walking distance from brendas location. All in all I had a perfect stay in Brendas AirBnB room, I can recommend her location highly.
This. Place!!! Tammy and Marc were really responsive, but also respect your privacy.
Her kitchen is well equipt to meet anyone's needs. 2) Her house has no AC but the fan was great for the unseasonable hot weather during our stay. 3) Thin curtains above the bed caused the bedroom to be lighter than we are used to as soon as we fell asleep, it was no problem.
She welcomed and treated us like friends. Lauren Jensen makes the rooms easily accessible for guest , and ensures that you have what you need. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to enjoy some beach fun, and doesn’t mind a nice drive along the coast to the chief highways.
I would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend this place enough. My boyfriend and I had a lovely time staying at Christian's! Christian was such a welcoming host who always made sure that we were having a good time and gave us loads of insider tips to better explore the city.
Elizabeth Jones responded quickly and the king bedroom/bathroom were comfortable and just as described. Check in directions were clear and a big plus that parking was available. Nice host, thanks so much.
Only issue was that my bf complained about hearing a loud tv noise that couldn’t let him sleep. Stayed here for one night (last night) in LA so that I would be close to LAX.
Michael's loft is simply beautiful, clean and exactly as pictured. It is central and easy to walk to from the train. We found it easy to go around without needing to use the metro .
A value. The kind of place you hope doesn’t get noticed by others. But obviously it has.
A stone throws distance from Whole Foods to pick up some food and the neighborhood is lovely and we felt very safe. The only downside is that the bathroom is outside the unit albeit a private one. It was a small cold during our visit so walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night was a tad little inconvenient but this was clearly advertised in the listing so it did not come as a surprise.
The house was very easy to locate and is situated on a quiet residential street with restaurants, coffee shops, and public transit just a few blocks away. Also- I cannot overstate how wonderful it was to have a parking spot! Overall, the space exceeded my expectations with many thoughtful details throughout that make it inviting and comfortable.
This was my first time using Airbnb and Melia certainly made it a pleasant experience! Not to mention her home has an amazing view! I highly recommend staying here for a trip to California.
We found Tammy's Place and it was perfect for our needs. I would  Definitely recommend her place . Me and my Husband are going to be staying there in a couple of weeks to Celebrate our Wedding Anniversary.
They have 2 sweet pooches who are out on the shared patio at times. We had a blast in the bay area to wrap up our honeymoon and we will definitely be reccomending this spot to others.
Absolutely perfect place to stay in SF! I used to live in SF and was traveling back for a friends wedding! Kelly's place was perfect to stay for me and my husband!
Cara’s Airbnb is one of the best we’ve stayed in. The decor is modern, the place is very clean, and as a host she communicates very well. We didn’t have time to go grocery shopping and we were delighted there was water and food items available to us in the fridge if we wanted them.
We hope to have the opportunity to stay there again in the future. The plants, the lights, the hammock! All antic .
Clifford Winkler was so thoughtful in every detail of setting up our stay. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it! Thank you, Clifford Winkler.
Short walk to beach and restaurant . Lovely neighborhood. Very relaxing and as nice as it could be!
Had a great time here, looking forward to next visit. Neva’s place is so amazing. It’s cozy!!
Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway. So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.
I was so taken with the photos, description of Melia's casita, and reviews that I did not hesitate to book, even though it was across the bridge and would be a drive to SF. The casita is small but has everything you could want for a comfortable stay. Such care and thought went in to planning this accommodation...from kitchen supplies, to beds and linens, to the beautiful décor, to the luxurious pullout in the living room (my son loved it!
But Airbnb is still asking me to write a reappraisal and so I’m going to review based on my communication with Richard Batton even though I didn’t get to actually stay. Thank you.
Downtown Chicago is about a 45-55 minute Uber ride during the week. Came into Chicago during the worst of the snow storm this year, and Leo & Alex's home was everything we could ask for and more! Lizbeth, who manages the rental responded to all of my texts immediately and was very attentive to our needs.
Being a single woman, I wanted some place safe and I found it at Elizabeth's. God bless you Elizabeth.
Best of all was the attention to detail. There we several nice touches like having ice cubes, Perrier water, filtered water, coffee, and tea waiting for us. Sierra even give us some suggestions of events that were happening close by and things that we can do with our family.
Very quick response by text so communication was perfect. Quiet nice residential area  Netflix!!! Keureg machine with plenty of coffee cups to enjoy every morning  Close to Whole Foods,pharmacy and Hermosa Beach!
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. There were also little surprises of bite and drinks that awaited us when we came in which was awesome. Seriously, if you’re ever in San Francisco, you simply have to book this place!
I especially loved how I got my own guest parking spot, private entrance, and private bathroom. The area is very lovely to walk around and convenient too. I am not surprised on why this listing is almost always booked.
Comfy bed and quiet area for good night's sleep. Easy check in and great communication. Only wish we had longer and definitely hope to be back in the future.
This beautiful loft was much bigger in person and everything about this space exceeded our expectations. I believe Michael went above & beyond and his place felt like home because he really cares for every detail. I loved the conversations, the local guidance + navigation skills, and the music.
Big Recommendation! David & Sae
Neva was a great host! Very responsive. The space was cunning , clean, and had good comforts .
This is a great place that puts you in walking distance to Redondo Beach. As someone visiting LA for a couple days, I wanted to be close to the beach and this topographic point definitely had it. In fact, not only could I walk to the beach, but there is a cool outdoor courtyard that you share with Neva that is super cute.
Easy walk to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. Once I asked Anne about it the following night, she had helpful suggestions that resolved the problem.
I had a great stay here. Raquel Eastham is a wonderful host, it was really easy to communicate with her and she is really nice. The room is wonderful because you have your own entrance and you have everything what you need.
Einfach nur perfekt! Jeff & Mike waren perfekte Gastgeber. Wir kommen gerne wieder!!
Dan and Elizabeth Jones’s small, privy cottage was exactly what we needed to escape to at the end of a long, crazy wedding day! The bed and amenities were comfortable and clean, and they easily accommodated our later than usual check-in. Elizabeth Jones also provided us with all of our wedding flowers, and even brought some of our luggage over to the cottage for us after setting up at our venue!
We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing. The apartment was very clean with lovely quality towels that we nice and fluffy. It had a book of local information which was helpful and was very conveniently location to restaurants and a few shops.
This was definitely the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Lots of amazing amenities, including snacks and motorcycle for guest . The topographic point was very clean and comfortable, and takes minutes to bike or walk/run to the beach.
I highly recommend his place... Scott was a great host and my boyfriend and I had a great stay in Redondo! We didn’t stay in the house a whole lot, but there was a view of the ocean from the bedroom window, a large bathroom (which included a towel warmer), and had full access to the rest of the house if needed.
Overall, this place felt like home and was very cozy. Nina and Merv were very kind, their dogs are cute and friendly, and we feel lucky to have stayed at their place! -Madi & the girls
We had a wonderful stay in Laurel and Sky’s lovely cottage. Even though we arrived very late, Laurel and Skye made our check-in easy and had left some lights on to show us the way. They kindly checked in with us the next day to see if we needed anything.
A hair dryer, iron, shampoo/ conditioner/ body wash-- all were provided and were great for business travel. I had an excellent night of sleep, as the bed in this unit is exceptionally comfortable. I loved the modern finishes, and thought for value this loft is a real gem.
Though I never met Marc in person, he was quick and clear with communication. This apartment is ideally located. Close to many restaurants in the Mission and Deborah Hines.
I had an outstanding stay at Shantell Preusser place. I did not have a chance to explore the surrounding area because of my out of town plans. Everything is within walking distance so if you enjoy exploring on foot, this is a very good option.
Overall, this topographic point felt like home and was very cozy. It was very comfortable, relaxing and VERY clean!!! Nina was an excellent host and made us feel very welcome!
Folks - This place and experience is AMAZING. Chuck is present when you ask/need him or invisible if you just seek silence however I must add, Chuck and his wonderful four legged friend Charlotte are sooooo much fun. Chuck is a wealth of information, knowledge, traveled experiences, amazing people he was worked with/for, you will not regret staying here, I promise you.
Christopher Brown and Ernie were warm and hospitable hosts. The room was a good size and the bed was super comfortable and could comfortably fit two people. I liked how they had put a Keurig, water and little brochures of local activities and places in the bookcase.
Historic. Thoughtful. Convenient.
On top of that, the location is awesome - two blocks from the beautiful beach and the bike path and close to lots of restaurants. Paul's place is in a great location. It's a very quick down to the beach and even if you forgot your beach stuff he's got you covered with everything you need to have a fun beach adventure.
Tiana's place is a beautiful beach cottage just minutes from Redondo beach. Numerous personal touches make staying here a very relaxing and enjoyable time. The cottage is immaculate and the amenities such as the beach cruiser and beach chairs simply add to entire experience.
The space is used very well in this home and doesn’t leave you feeling cramped. The train station is a short walk away from the home making it a convenient place to stay if you’re not wanting to be in the city. We felt incredibly safe and welcomed in Min’s home.
Gregory Simons herself is warm and welcoming but gives one privacy, a perfect combination. If you use the Oakland airport it is only minutes away. We highly recommend her place.
Absolutely loved our stay at Neva’s place. It had everything we needed in an accommodation - great location, nice and cozy, and an above and beyond host. Would definitely consider staying here again the next time we’re in LA.
Shantell Preusser was a great host and the bungalow was fully equipped with everything we needed for our stay— she even left a few tasty treats for us! We absolutely loved everything about it and Shantell Preusser was excellent with her communication and making sure we were fully taken care of.
Hands down this Airbnb wins the cutest, coziest, comfiest award! My husband and I joked that we could live here. Every detail has been thought out for making it an enjoyable stay.
There was great water pressure, and while we noticed the large spa tub, we didn't have time to use it (besides, we're Californians who worry about water use! ), but I'm sure it would be great! The location is wonderful!
Things we loved about the Cozzy Cottage,  the beds are sooo comfy, literally every morning when my mother and I woke up all we kept saying was what a great night sleep we got. I also thought it was cool how there’s a door to the living room area where I stayed. When I pulled out the sofa bed at  night and closed the door, I got privacy and the living room turned into a second bedroom.
Both the room and location are wonderful, it really is like a hotel experience only more stylish and there was a sofa (very comfortable) nearby if you don't want to sit on the bed. Speaking of the bed, it's really comfortable and perfect for resting after a day of hiking the hills of San Francisco, and John Brashier provides multiple sheet options for you which is a nice touch. It is also worth mentioning the view which is something else, from both the bedroom and the living room.
Definitely recommended! Great place. Beautiful home in nice neighborhood a short walk to Redondo Beach/pier.
Neva’s place was perfect for our needs! Convenient location and super easy check in. Neva is warm and welcoming, and meeting her sweet pup, Logan was an extra special dainty !
P.S. Melissa's place is not fancy, but it was within cycling distance of the beach and restaurant , and she was friendly and helpful with dining suggestions. I was only there for a short one night stay, but I brought my bicycle and had a great ride through a nearby park that came out close to Rudees Inlet, where I picked up the boardwalk and rode to the north end of the beach for a swim and a great meal at a local restaurant.
The setting was lovely in her amazing garden which you are able to enjoy even if only on your way to and from the outdoor bathroom--which may have been my favorite part! This is my 5th Airbnb in the area, and I'd book this one first if it is available!
I also woke up late on my check out time and she was so understanding and flexible. Since I’ll definitely will be back ! Thanks NEVA!!!
Kitchen area was great, stocked with all of the appliances, cookware & dishes we needed. Would absolutely love to return and would recommend to anyone seeking that perfect, private little beach getaway!
 picture do not begin to show the beauty of this place. The private deck/ patio is nice but the swimming pool and hot tub are so amazing . The scenery around them is what makes it so restful .
Pamela Drew place is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museums. Couldn't ask for anything more.
 antic place with many beautiful and funny details. I especially loved all the different kinds of lamps and the green plant . The vicinity is buzzing.
There's a motorcycle two boogie boards and a beach chair too. Look under the sink for left over bathroom stuff that may save you a purchase at cvs during your stay.
We loved this topographic point . There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly.
Rayford Kelly and Dan's cottage is the perfect place to relax after the hustle and bustle of a jam jammed vacation. My husband and I were inspired by this space, with its simplicity and aesthetic. The bathroom is to die for, and we did not take the claw foot tub for granted.
Edwin Green was even better than we expected. I knew it was going to be a great home from the sterling reviews, but I was still surprised to find this stylish space that is equipped with every little essentials left there by a very thoughtful host. Check-in instructions were easy to follow.
Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! We spent 3 nights at Chris’s studio apartment and think that the only valid description for both the hosts and the apartment is ‘fantastic’! Chris went out of her way to make our stay special.
Gregory Simons and Charlotte (the sweetest pup) were the best hosts. Gregory Simons was very attentive and responsive to all of our question , and also provided helpful tips to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable. The house was sparkling clean, the bedrooms were comfortable and well appointed,  and the amenities were plentiful.
There was even a cruiser bike, which made my commute to my conference fun - and it was perfect for the bike trail along the beach. This is easily one of my favorite AirBnB experiences of all time.
Brian Burns was the ultimate host! I typically stay in the same hotel each time I visit the East Bay for work. After this visit at Brian Burns's guest house, I'm convinced that this experience was significantly better than any hotel I could stay in.
A nice selection of shampoo/body wash is available in the shower. There is a walk out private porch. Great Value and I would stay again.
The collection of Kerrigan coffee and teas were such a nice touch, and even the sparkling assorted sodas in the refrigerator was a nice surprise. Nina’s tiny home is most certainly one of my “go to” places now, and I can’t wait for my next visit!
Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Laurie and Ron. (I just asked my husband to read this and he said it sounds fake. I promise, it isn't!)
This is an amazing find in a city crowded with excellent listings. I was able to get some work done in the common space while taking in the skyline. Even had a quick chat with Tyler, who shared some great local recommendations.
This fit the bill. We really enjoyed the little thoughts that went into the place. Clean, nicely decorated interior.
This was our first tiny house stay and it blew us away. Michael Krieg and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. We met briefly, in the driveway once and they were courteous and warm, but didn't keep us around to talk but let us go on our to dinner without any fuss.
We especially enjoyed the close proximity to shops, the beach and use of your Beach Cruisers !!! A very comfortable place with a very pleasant and accommodating host. Located in a quiet, nice neighborhood, it is within walking distance of many shops and restaurants.
One of our favorite AirBnB location ever! Hip, comfortable and in a great location. Heather and JP have thought of everything you will need to enjoy your stay.
Angela was super apologetic about the light construction happening next door, but there's nothing she could have done about that. What a great place to stay! This was my first experience with an Airbnb with my boyfriend and it was absolutely amazing.
And fun to look around at the art they are creating in the space when its not being rented to outside folks. The loft was a fantastic place for hanging out, playing some pool, watching some movies and just relaxing. The location worked well since my son was in Seattle the night before so had a quick walk from the Amtrak station stop in Tacoma to the apartment.
Truly a great experience! Shantell Preusser place was stylish, modern, clean, and provides just what I needed for my stay. The self check in process is so easy and the location of the apartment is convenient,safe and easily accessible(no need to go through gates or fences or side alleys,etc.
 World Health Organization wouldn’t like that?) We had the opportunity to meet the host in the morning and she was very polite and cheerful which again made us love the topographic point even more. We do plan on staying again in the future.
The topographic point was also so beautiful and so homelike . I highly recommend staying here!
Thomas George’s home is not only gorgeous, but super cunning and comfortable. We loved that we were able to make breakfast before going out each day, and loved how close it was to the beach. Thomas George is a wonderful host!
Great location with easy distance to tons of restaurants & activities. Very clean space and comfortable bed. We had a hiccup during our stay with the power going out in the WHOLE town (freak incident)!
Overall, it was an unforgettable experience and we had a wonderful time! We will definitely book this topographic point again if we visit Chicago!
We had a great stay at Marcos Blount's place! Marcos Blount provides next level customer service with directions for every single thing you might have questions on at his place. The room itself is cozy for two people but plenty of space for what we needed.
Excellent location + excellent hostess = excellent stay! The location of the guest house was super close to both Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, as well as a nearby strip mall with Whole Foods and Paris Baguette. We really enjoyed the patio and garden area that made it super relaxing.
There are some great restaurants and a grocery store nearby- we loved the area. We also thought the locals were extremely friendly. Brent and Barry's Carriage House is clean, comfortable, and has every little thing you could possibly need.
This was my first time at Susan & Roy's place. I just loved it!! I regularly come to Tacoma to visit my daughter at college.
Highly recommend. A great small beach cottage, five minute walk to the beach. The cottage was clean and in good shape.
Joelle is an AMAZING host. If we ever come back to Oakland we're definitely going to stay with her again. Read on for more details!
Relatively close to lax. Elizabeth lives downstairs and rents three rooms upstairs. No complaints!
Thank you for being a wonderful host. We loved your cottage with our big family. The place was beautiful and sparkling clean.
So close to our relatives place, this space is very chic with some thoughtful touches and a relaxed vibe. They were very communicative hosts and we appreciated their extra help with check in as we arrived hours later than expected. They have 2 sweet pooch who are out on the shared patio at times.
Every time we go back to Tacoma in the future, we will be staying here. We initially were going to stay for just 2 nights, but our plan required for a longer stay and Joan Litwin was more than accommodating  When we tried extending our stay, we had issues with the Airbnb website and Joan Litwin was so understanding and caring about the issue we were having. Couldn’t have asked for a better host.
Bonus for all the extra linens, iron and ironing board, and bedding. Elizabeth’s room was comfortable and clean. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood within easy walking distance to the Redondo beach pier as well as the local shops and cafes.
If you want a private escape with a private pool and hot tub with a beautiful serene 3 acre setting to view from your second story deck - Bennie Dudgeon's is the topographic point to be! Personal touches galore in the apartment, welcoming hosts that checked in just to be sure there was nothing we needed and an absolutely spotless 2 bedroom apartment. Everything we wanted to do and see was within a 1/2 hours drive and the local restaurants were great and very close to the property.
:) The rooms are light, bright, and spacious. Otherwise, things could not have been more perfect. I  would ecourage anyone to stay there and I plan to use Edwin Green again when visiting Seattle!
Quiet, very private, serene. The location was perfect for me, short drive to visit my daughter at college, and the very quiet and peaceful neighborhood was great for a morning walk. Short drive to Old Town and pretty much anywhere else in Tacoma you want to go, without any traffic noise.
Location is in a very safe quite neighbourhood. Can walk around late at night without problem. Room was super clean and comfortable bed.
Tyler has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience. It feels private and secure and is located in a nice little neighbourhood which, while being out of the main tourist centre, is close enough to lots of bars and restaurants and is a short Uber or bus ride into the centre. The welcome pack was really helpful and we had a nice brunch at one of Tyler’s recommended musca volitans .
This place has all the little touches that makes an airbnb awesome! T is a fabulous, communicative host. Thank you again!
She had beach towels, warm robes, and even eggs and yogurt in the fridge for us. Book this AirBnB if you have a chance, it was absolutely wonderful!! !
"Above and beyond" expectations is clearly their motto. This is my third visit, and it's always even better than I remembered. Quiet, spacious, comfortable, close to everything in the north end, with everything you need, plus so many sweet and thoughtful extras.
This is one of the best properties we've stayed in for a few reasons: great location, value, quality of space and amenities provided. We are a family of 4 and the guesthouse offers enough space to sleep us all with parking and a small outdoor space to enjoy the coastal breezes. Not only is the location antic (1 block to the beach) but it is so nice to enjoy a property that is completely ready to go!
This is the second time I have stayed at Richard Batton's lovely place and everything was just as perfect as it was on my first visit. Richard Batton allowed me to check in early so I could enjoy a ride on one of the complimentary beach bikes which was just what I needed after my long flight. I will definitely be back!
It's still funky in a methadone-clinic sort of way but clearly on the upswing and I can't wait to get back. And the loft itself surpasses expectation with a large open floor plan and great furnishing.
The home is as advertised and then some with all right detail with the guest(s) in mind. They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. Take advantage of their guidebook recommendations.
I was so taken with the photos, description of Melia's casita, and reviews that I did not hesitate to book, even though it was across the bridge and would be a drive to SF. The casita is small but has everything you could want for a comfortable stay. Such care and thought went in to planning this accommodation...from kitchen supply , to beds and linens, to the beautiful décor, to the epicurean pullout in the living room (my son loved it!
I highly recommend staying here. We can’t wait to come back!
Upon arriving he immediately offered me a drink, we sat and chatted for a while and then he kindly left me to do my own thing. His place is really quirky. It might not be for everyone, but I loved it!
What really solidified my confidence in staying in this home was Susan’s hospitality. Beautiful little gem. Quiet, very private, serene.
They are amazing. Matthew An gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. They have thought of so many little touches I've rarely seen in airbnbs including bottles of water and bananas to get you started.
Who wouldn’t like that?) We had the opportunity to meet the host in the morning and she was very polite and cheerful which again made us love the place even more. We do plan on staying again in the future.
We have had an incredible trip! The whole building was super clean, comfortable, stylish, and safe. Rod was always super quick to respond to any questions we had and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants.
The perfekt Airbnb Experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We felt very comfortable with Elizabeth Jones. She really thought of everything, from slippers to breakfast in the fridge. And Elizabeth Jones was just adorable, warm and open.
Bonus for all the extra linens, iron and ironing board, and bedding. Alejandrina Anderson room was comfortable and clean. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood within easy walking distance to the Redondo beach pier as well as the local shops and cafes.
We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast in the cozy kitchen, and would’ve been happy to stay for more days if our travel plans had allowed. A wonderful retreat!
The house is extremely close to the airport - which is convenient, but I wondered if the noise would be debatable (I'm a light sleeper and pretty sensitive to noise) - nope, you can hear the occasional plane but it isn't bothersome at all, and we slept very well. So big thumb up for Wiseacre, for Chuck and for his sweet dog Charlotte.
The room had a good lock on the door so it really felt secure. From booking to check out, Jodi Stallings was extremely accommodating and thorough. I love to stay in unique spaces and Jodi Stallings’s space was perfect.
Nathan is an incredibly gracious host. Did I mention, Nathan's place is bad ass? Haha, seriously.
Very close to the beach with parking spot right in front of the house. Highly  recommend a stay.
Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. The home is just as described, and the view is just as incredible as in the picture. The room...seriously exceeds all expectations.
Very close to Redondo Beach and we loved biking around, it was a nice touch! Very clean and nicely decorated. We had 4 people stay and the excess bed (futon) is not very comfy but we were only there 2 nights and switched with the other couple.
We were visiting New York for the first time, and we decided to stay in Queens to experience hospitality in a more cozy way than a hotel, and staying at Igor's place was a great choice. The place is really really clean, the room had an instruction manual in english, spanish and chinesse, and it was very clear and helpful. The house  is located within a walking distance (about 15 min) from Forest Hills metro station, and the neighborhood is really nice, so specially during daylight, the walk was very pleasing.
My wife and I had a great 4 night stay. All were within driving distance as well as Uber. She let us use her bikes to get to Hermosa Beach as well as downtown Redondo, which made our stay even more enjoyable!
Lets just say that Heather was awesome! She always kept in touch before our trip and made sure our flight was still on time from Washington DC. Once we arrived, she was there to greet us at the front door with a big smile on her face.
This is the best Airbnb place we have stayed at and we’ve stayed at a few. We were expecting it to be really good, but it was better! The photographs do not do it justice.
Being a single woman, I wanted some place safe and I found it at Crystal Romero's. Edward Ramsey bless you Crystal Romero.
Immaculate  Luxurious  Chic Haven  Dissolve into the bath Melt into the beds Nourish in the kitchen  Retreat to Luis Hawkins and Maximo’s whole apartment  Whenever you need a get-away feel during your Andersonville visit  This is my second stay at this lovely space. A stellar listing, guaranteed to revive you during whatever activities you choose. A fabulous home base!
Michael's place was just what I needed! Having privacy in the bedroom was great and having the bathroom in the there was such a nice touch. I loved the location!
Def will keep this one on our list to revisit! Lots of little details that made my short stay worth the drive outside of LAX airport area. I would stay here again!
John Brashier thought of absolutely everything we could have needed. She had beach towel , warm robes, and even eggs and yogurt in the fridge for us. I would argue that it was better than most hotel experiences.
Roberta Hallenbeck is prompt to communicate - super helpful when arriving after dark and it's hard to the see the house numbers in the neighborhood. The bed is comfy with plenty of blankets to keep warm. The bathroom is plenty sufficient.
There are 2 bathrooms: the bathroom on the second floor is mostly shared by you and the other AirBNB room, and the bathroom on the first floor is mostly used by May, but you're allowed to use it too (and it has a cool Japanese toilet!) The attic actually has more floor space than the main room, but you have to duck down a bit while walking around. The chief room has a private balcony attached.
We had a delightful chat, and I felt like I was staying with new friends. I highly recommend their home to others.
Stephane’s place is an adorable, very well decorated & clean basement suite in a very nice part of Tacoma, equip with all you need including A/C! We felt very safe. The Queen bed is extremely comfortable!
My family and I had a wonderful experience at The Carriage house. The home was very clean and was supplied with many item just in case you forgot something. They even provided games which were much appreciated on a rainy day.
Used the bikes and grill. This was the perfect spot for a long awaited Girl’s weekend w me and my best friend. Perfect for 2 people.
We definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn’t mind a little bit of climb to get to the house and also doesn’t mind staying outside the city. This is a phenomenal space that gives you a superb experience of luxury in the city. Beginning with the electronic key box with a retractable (can’t lose it) key fitting in a well made glass and metal door, to the clever shoe rack and the polished wood floors taking you to your excellent, smartly appointed, compact private room and bath, you know right away that you are in a very fine home maintained by someone with impeccable, modern taste.
Same was true for the day of my check-out - Raquel Eastham kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. Bottom line: Excellent value. Perfectly outfitted space with the charm and character that defines the ideal airbnb experience.
I cannot say anything bad about this topographic point . :)
Numerous personal touches make staying here a very relaxing and enjoyable time. We have stayed at numerous places in the Hermosa Beach/Redondo Beach area and this is bar none the best place to stay. Thank you Tiana - it I could give more than 5 stars I would!
I would not hesitate to recommend this listing. We realy enjoyed our stay at Sierra's lovely home. Her home was in a great location where we felt very safe.
The home was so bright and cheerful, and the kitchen had all the amenities and then some for those that are super inspired to cook for themselves. Quiet neighborhood and within walking distance for basic needs and amenities. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the instructions for the guidelines to honor within her home were very clear and simple.
We enjoyed our stay, though it might be a little pricey for the space; it is essentially a well appointed basement apartment where no cooking is allowed. Amazing loft with about a 12 minute ride to downtown Tacoma. The loft felt like a home and we found it hard to want to leave at times.
Paul also provided some snacks and beverages for out stay. Paul's place was excellent; very stylish and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable.
We had such an amazing time riding the bikes she had available for us on the beach! There was plenty of room for us to park our rental car and the bungalow was very spacious for 2. Overall I would highly recommend Angela’s place!
We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental. It’s hard to park in Alameda & one thing that worried us at night, we might not get a parking space on the street. At least with Marty’s place we have our own parking space even if we return to the studio late night.. no worries  & no stress .
A delightful, positive person with lots of great energy! I booked this for my Dad's visit as we are currently without a guest room. I wanted a home away from home for him and that's exactly what he received!
She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love!
Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! Very quite and safe neighborhood. I highly recommend her topographic point to anyone.
I would absolutely recommend these living quarters ! Great for a weekend getaway!
We were “cool” from there. There is construction so you have to careful when walking. There is a local transportation system that will take you to the local parallel bars and back to the bungalow .
The location is minutes from the freeway, UPS, old town Tacoma and Ruston Way. The cottage was without a doubt one of our favorite AirBNB stays! the property is beautiful, and Michelle's garden and neighborhood were spectacular.
They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. Pamela Drew goes out of her way to let me know of new restaurants, events and sites to see each time I visit. The neighborhood is beautiful.
Their place is truly a reprieve . Especially suited for contemplation, writing, or long conversations with a loved one over beverage of choice while watching the sunset gently over the water. It is great to have a full kitchen and they leave nice notes and treats for the guests.
My two youngest and I had the bench in the great room for our beds. The kitchen is to die for. Every agreeableness imaginable.
Definitely would recommend Bennie Dudgeon's place for a beach stay well worth the price! Literally a block away from the beach. The room was stocked with anything we needed and sparkling clean.
 fringe benefit provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! Thank you Marc and Tammy we hope we can come back, someday :)
Einfach nur perfekt! Wir haben uns extrem wohl gefühlt, das Zimmer ist modern und schick, alles da was man sich wünscht, sogar Aveda Shampoo....alles bis ins kleinste Detail durchdacht. Die Lage ist einfach unschlagbar, Fillmore Street um die Ecke mit tollen Shops und Restaurants.
Stayed a night with my wife for a wedding at the historic Redondo Beach library, and we were able to walk to the venue within ten minutes. Very comfortable bed with simple, clean style, and Lois Davis provided some water upon our return following the reception. Would definitely stay here again.
The beautiful, modern guest house is thoughtfully set up for guests with everything including light switches labeled...instructions next to all appliances...plenty of cooking supplies and (Website hidden by Airbnb) conditioning...toiletries and comfy towels...plus plenty of visitor info and personal travel recommendations from the host. Loved the security features and felt very comfortable walking about though as in all areas of the city, you should use good street sense if venturing very far on foot. We did walk to the Arthur Paddick grocery store—which was an easy distance though I would be cautious doing so after dark (as you would do anywhere in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) special concerns).
Location is also perfect. Dont hesitate to book!!! Would absolutely recommend Tylers topographical point .
The location was convenient to exploring some really cool shops, bars, and restaurants nearby. It was a great way to experience some local flavor outside of the more touristy stuff. Thanks for a great visit!
I think you never regret if you will chose Melisa's house. P.S. She has a guitar and ukulele
Heather's topographic point was such a great find!! We came to WA to visit my sister. Our flight landed at 10 and after getting the rental and finding some food we showed up at 12.
The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. Had a wonderful stay at Angela’s. I was traveling for work, and this conveniently located unit had everything I needed - comfy bed, fast WiFi, a solid workspace and great bath amenities - all in a cozy unit.
There are just no words to describe this place. Jodi Stallings was the most gracious, funny, warming, magical host. My boyfriend and I laughed, cried(happy tears), relaxed, and stood still.
There is a shared kitchen and living room area. Was able to walk or take a quick Uber ride to where ever we needed to go. Very clean, large space and will definitely book again.
Tammy and James Walker were exceeding hosts. Everything was as expected and described perfectly. The room is perfect for 2 people.
My wife and I came here for a long weekend and really enjoyed ourselves. The place was very clean and the TV was huge (75 in. I think) .. Joan Litwin had chair , umbrellas, beach towels and blankets we were able to bring to the beach with us.
Our stay at Lindsay Brown’s was incredible! We had high expectations for the unique artist loft and location and everything was surpassed. The space is amazing—we loved our loft and the views from the apartment.
The place itself was fantastic as well. With the ocean just a few blocks away, this place is an ideal location. You get the fresh ocean air but you're just removed enough from the traffic of PCH  to enjoy a peaceful and quiet night's sleep and still within walking distance of the Redondo Beach Pier, among many other places to see.
Marcia was a wonderfull host and made our stay memorable. A severe snow storm came through Tacoma while we were staying and she made sure we had breakfast and gave advice when it was best to continue on our journey. The apartment was perfect and Marcia provided extra snacks which came in handy as we arrived late.
And by the way those new 4 recently refurbished rooms are so beautiful with individual bathrooms ; high ceilings and have an early 20th century style . We did enjoyed your company . See you again,,,
Matthew An’s room was about a 20 minute flat walk to the 24th street mission BART station which was very convenient. Communication was great, Matthew An gave a ton of amazing recommendations. Location is also a plus, it’s in a great area of SF that has a great vibe - lots of places to eat, drink and shop.
Then the next day we went to downtown Berkeley, to the Farmer's Market and to the Berkeley campus. Then to San Francisco where we had lunch in China town and watched the Women's March on Market Street which was HUGE! The second evening we walked to dinner at a restaurant just a few blocks from the cottage.
I would highly recommend Angela's place to anyone looking to stay in SF! My husband and I stayed here for two nights before I dropped him at SFO  The space is clean and roomy (for a studio), with high ceilings, a walk in closet, large bathroom, and comfortable seating area. The weather was great when we visited, so we loved the balcony.
Ian and Tenzing have created a lovely space for visitors to stay in and ensured that privacy was maintained at all times. Ian was very helpful and recommended some good places to go visit whilst in San Fransisco. We would definitely stay here again!
Elizabeth provides a very comfortable and relaxing space. I highly recommend a stay at her place. So many thoughtful amenities were provided and the bed was divine.
Extremely clean and the host was very quick to respond/help with anything. Saved us money on Uber rides and were also just fun. Loved this place and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area!
All of the little extras touches made us feel so welcomed. The highlight of our trip was riding her two new bikes up the coast to Santa Monica...what a great day we had! The home is in such a great location and almost everything is within walking or biking distance.
Katherine's thoughtfully furnished room felt more like a self sufficient home. The house was in a quiet yet easily accessible street, only two blocks from an almost private beach. The main boardwalk area is less than 10 minutes away.
Star & Austin were great host and checked in with us several times throughout the visit to make sure we had everything we needed. We especially liked that they had a chalkboard with their restaurant recommendations in the room & we checked several of them out!
For me it's all about the vibe, the amenities, and the location. My colleague and I were in town to do a project that required a lot of creative thinking, so this space was just the fertile ground we needed. Brian and Hillary were uber-responsive and the place had everything we needed - including coffee, tea, cream, and even a few local brews.
The cottage itself was cute, cozy and comfortable. Check in and check out was very easy. We just so happened to run into Dan and was able to chat with him for a topographic point .
The quaint pubs and vintage shop along 6th ave were closed for the night but looked promising. I wish we could've spent a bit more time in the area to pop into the local shops.
I don’t want to write a review because I don’t want to share this place with everyone, it’s an amazing topographic point . Shelton Gill and Jacqueline are amazing hosts, giving us tips on the area and San Fran, warned us about tolls, reservations needed for certain spots, and where the best people watching would be. I’d highly recommend seeing if they have an opening for you.
She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. Leslie had instruction manual (wifi, thermostat, tv, etc) and rules printed out for us. The kitchen was stocked with all of our cooking needs (pots, pans, utensils) and all the cabinets were labeled so everything was easy to navigate.
If you’re looking at this and this space is still available, stop what you’re doing and reserve it. Then come back and read all of the 5-star reviews! James Walker is a beautiful, stylish and comfortable topographic point for a interruption from the mundane or if you want as much out of your lodging as you do from your visit to WA.
It was easy-in and easy-out with everything I could have possibly needed to make my overnight stay pleasant and refreshing. Jimmy is a kind and accommodating host. His home and suite are clean and well equipped.
We loved this place! We loved the bathroom - the shower is so beautiful. Bed is massive and so comfortable too!
Walk out of the cottage in any direction and there are things to do and lovely residential neighborhoods to stroll. City of Tacoma has loads of offer. Museums are outstanding and unique, lots of fun dining spots, and extraordinary vistas of the Sound.
I had an outstanding stay at Shelton Gill's topographic point . Although we only stayed for a night on our way back, I cannot recommend Shelton Gill's place enough. Great location, and the room is just wow.
I sure appreciate having such a nice place to stay while I’m in town. Thank you Christiana, and thank you for checking in with me to make sure everything was alright, and asking if I had everything I needed. Christiana is definitely a super host that goes the extra mile.
Justin’s place is close to the one of the best restaurants in the world, as well as the “gourmet ghetto” of excellent and inexpensive food. I’d highly recommend Justin’s place!
OMG, the bathroom is so well stocked with literally almost anything you need, even hair products and a dryer! Thanks Scott!
The loft is very close to Downtown and major sights with easy acces to public transportation system . Highly recommend.
I stayed two nights, while on business. There is a full set of spice , olive oil, and balsamic-- everything you need to enjoy a light meal. A hair dryer, iron, shampoo/ conditioner/ body wash-- all were provided and were great for business travel.
We were able to walk to the beach in the morning and down to our favorite donut shop called Bluestar donuts amazing and a great eatery that I think on yelp is five star called eat at Joe’s which is right next to a wonderful coffee shop called the boy and the bear. Everything we needed in a place to stay was supplied by our wonderful hostess would stay there again for our next visit in the Redondo Beach area
Melia's casita is a fantastic place to stay when in the Bay Area! I have stayed at many homes when visiting family in the Bay Area, and this one was the most well-appointed, with thoughtful touch for decorating and amenities for breakfast, among other highlights. The view from the private deck is very lovely, and we had fun eating breakfast in the morning and watching planes taking off and landing at Oakland Airport.
Listening to live jam sessions was an added bonus! Thanks, Amy and Dennis!
Me and my Husband are going to be staying there in a couple of weeks to Celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. We had a wonderful stay at Tammy’s! The room and en suite were clean and well decorated.
Better choice is to explore Rockridge/Temescal area eateries, many within 1/2 to a mile walk. Relatively quiet area given proximity to major Oakland-Berkeley streets and Rockridge BART station. Colin greeted us upon arrival and told us all we needed to know about the place and area.
Susan & Khahn’s place is easily the nicest airb&b we have stayed in. A really WONDERFUL experience! !
I really wanted to ride a bike on the boardwalk, but didn't have time, so I guess I'll be back! Pretty cool. Deborah Hines also provided snacks in the room and lots of toiletry items in the bathroom--even sunscreen which we shoulda used.
I think) .. Christine had chairs, umbrellas, beach towels and blankets we were able to bring to the beach with us. We asked if she had a cooler and she let us borrow one for the weekend which was a major bonus. Her daughter in law Maddie was extremely helpful as well.
It is a very short walk to the Redondo Beach Pier with some good seafood restaurants. It is a very quiet and nice neighborhood. Highly recommended if you are staying in the Redondo Beach area.
We loved staying here during a work conference! The pillow were as comfortable as any hotel I’ve stayed at, and the beds and sofa were great too. I hope to stay here again someday!
Every component , from the spa-like goodies to soy candles, was tastefully curated by function and design. If you’re looking for a calm, serene, and intimate experience -- choose this place. What you don’t see on this listing is photograph of her modern and inviting outdoor patio space.
Not only was the coach house immaculate, but it was cozy, inviting, and full of thoughtful touches. The location was easy to get to and close to everything. Super convenient.
There was a small issue when we checked in, but it was resolved so quickly and communication was great. We had an awesome time and would definitely stay there again!
Check in was easy. Nonetheless, I received very good feedback from Igor who is always very accommodating prior to the stay (from our direct conversation) and throughout their stay (as per feedback from my parents). The feedback from my parents that I received is that the room is nice and clean as per the description.
The experience here is truly seamless-- Tyler is immensely thoughtful, super responsive and considerate. I can't recommend staying here enough. I was in town for grad school studies, so was out all day, and it was a great retreat to return to each night.
Excellent location + excellent hostess = excellent stay! The location of the guest house was super close to both Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, as well as a nearby strip mall with Whole Foods and Paris Baguette. We really enjoyed the patio and garden area that made it super restful .
We would highly recommend staying here and definitely wouldn't hesitant to stay here again! There is ample space for hanging out, sleeping and cooking and every space is spotlessly clean. The outdoor patio is perfect for a morning coffee or breakfast and the pool right next to it is the place to be in the afternoons.
We have had an incredible trip! The location couldn’t have been better as we were just a few steps from public transportation and a market for groceries was right at the corner. Even when we came inside to escape the rain, we had a spectacular position of the city.
This is my second stay and it is as perfect as the first. My husband’s health took a turn and Kara and Clifford Winkler took the tome to listen to the ramblings of this middle aged lady after a very long day. They even offered their laundry facilities!
Thank you so much for your amazing hospitality. Tyler has done an exceptional job of curating a beautiful and peaceful space for his guests. He has thought through every single detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robe - he has anticipated his guests' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special.
It is the perfect place for anyone looking to stay a few nights in San Francisco. Also street parking was always available in front of the home throughout our stay and the location of the home is super convenient and close to everything. Would definitely stay again, thank you so much Angela!
Beautiful room and home. Super clean and close to the beach. Elizabeth was very friendly and responsive, as well as very accommodating with our checking in time and offering a luggage storage option.
Very clean, private quiet place minutes from the HB pier. Shantell Preusser was very helpful at check in, the place was well stocked, getting to ride the motorcycle and having a parking pass was very thoughtful. If parking, pay attention to where you are allowed to park on what days to avoid any tickets, the streets are clearly marked on what days the street cleaners come.
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. I can’t rave enough about Angela’s bungalow. She was extra hospitable and had so many great touches to her place.
There’s a few restaurants nearby which offers decent brunch & dinner. Thanks sandy n Kristine once again, their Two doggies were rly tame and cute as well!
Jim and Maxim are awesome hosts, I was blown away  I was blown away For my stay  it was my first time staying airbnb plus. I’m happy to say th i’m happy to say where very  comfortable and well rested. So my mom first time using Airbnb with me  he was blown away on how good it was to be able to get a such a Nich place.
It was also wonderful being so close to Point Defiance, we went to Anthony’s (4 minute drive) right next to the park and had great seafood with a beautiful view, and went for a beautiful hike on a different day. This spacious attic apartment is a special place to stay, and makes you want to plant yourself in its cozy embrace and enjoy all its charms. I liken it to house-sitting for your girlfriend, who has magazine-worthy taste in antique collecting and design!
The closet is large and generous to hold your suitcases, as this delightful room is more “pocket size” than the usual overly large hotel room; it’s more like an updated luxury room in an early 1900’s fancy city hotel (Algonquin in NYC, Benson in Portland, or a Westin packaged into a compact structure). Our only cautions for others in selecting this property are commonplace for SF hilly neighborhoods:  (1) it does involve at least a dozen stairs for carrying your luggage so make sure you can do that; and (2) if you are coming via car instead of taxi/shared ride service, do expect to hunt for parking that could be a five minute (and possibly) steep walk away in the neighborhood of often narrow streets, as this is in the aptly named Bernal Heights  — but as we said, those two cautions exist in most hilly SF neighborhoods (we lived in nearby Glen Park for 20 years). Otherwise, you will surely be delighted by the experience and by Tyler’s detailed and generous hospitality.
Angela was wonderful, the bungalow was perfect, cozy, had everything we needed, and was in a great location! She had bikes to use to bike around town, we loved that! There are some great spot nearby, we took the bikes up to el segundo, fun brunch spots, this area has it all.
The space was immaculate and stylish, and the keypad check-in was a breeze - Brent even accommodated an early check-in for me since I was already in town on business. The beach is just steps away and we enjoyed having it almost all to ourselves!!! Easy short drive to grocery shopping, restaurants and down to the VA Beach boardwalk area.
Some of those special touches included fresh flowers,  fresh land coffee, homemade granola and containers of Greek yogurt for breakfast, evening snacks (cookies and tea), and a lovely patio,  The location was GREAT — a block from the 4th Street area in Berkeley, where we always enjoy spending time at our visits to Berkeley. We will definitely stay here again when we return to the East Bay
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Janet Luckman and Thomas George's bungalow . We had the whole place to ourselves with free parking and access to all things beach going (towels, chairs, bikes, etc). The cottage itself was decorated in a most beautiful and artistic way.
I would definitely recommend people to stay here! We had a wonderful stay in Laurel and Sky’s lovely cottage. The cottage is in a quiet neighborhood and the many windows make it light, sunny and welcoming with a view onto the surrounding hills and the secluded back yard.
I love this place. It is super close to everything (beach, restaurants, grocery store stores, gas stations, library, post office, LAX). Tiana is super helpful with restarant suggestions, etc., and she is very quick to respond.
Then interior of the cottage is spotlessly clean, and more than adequately supplied with all the amenities that you would need for your stay there. Heather is a wonderful host!! I can totally see why she is considered a Superhost with Airbnb.
That's all I needed to start the petition for 10 stars on Airbnb. Even though I got in pretty late (flying from the east coast) their warm welcome was quite comforting after a long day of travel. The suite was very clean and had quite a few thoughtful touches.
We loved this location and vicinity . It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions.
Kind, helpful, caring, great conversations. Their house was emotionally warm and amazing in every aspect! My wife was amazed daily as was I.
It's so nice being so close to the water. At high tide you can't access the beach, but there are chairs on the bulkhead so you can still sit and enjoy the water. Chip provides a tide table so you know when the tide is low.
My family and I could not be happier with staying here. Not only was the coach house immaculate, but it was cozy, inviting, and full of thoughtful touches. The space was just right for our group, felt safe and private despite being in the city.
What you get is  (1) a large space with a comfortable sofa and bed as well as a table with 2 chairs, (2) a small, separate kitchen with a microwave, sink, and small refrigerator well-stocked with mineral water, juices, yogurt, granola and other items, (3) a bathroom with a very large modern shower, and (4) a beautiful private garden with direct access from the studio through glass doors. The location is super -- right next to Golden Gate Park and steps away from countless first rate restaurants and bakeries.
Angela’s place was antic . The space is well utilized and no space is wasted. Everything was clean and great amenities.
The unit was super clean, decor was lovely, and had everything I needed. If I ever need another secluded work spot in the future - I sure hope this location will be available. :)
She has thought of everything you could possibly need to make a getaway as comfortable as possible. All of the little supernumerary touches made us feel so welcomed. From the eggs and bagel in the fridge to all of the other snacks and beverages, she makes you feel like your staying at a family member home.
Closet space is amazing! And, even though the area is very busy with traffic, it's a very quiet corner. I'd stay there again, for sure!
She greeted me at my arrival to show me around and answer any questions. Her place is also really close to the beach and shopping. I highly recommend her place!
10/10 will go back!! Thank you again!
It is quaint, full of local  charm, great chow and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the bogus touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.
:) We really enjoyed our stay. It was just the right size for our time in the Sunset Beach area, it had a lot of quaint local places to eat at, and it was super easy to use the Muni Transportation to get to all the San Francisco places we wanted to visit.
Very friendly folks. We also hit a new spot called Wooden City on Pacific (GOOD FOOD & friendly service) and HONEY COFFEE at Alma Mater for breakfast (they had super yum meat, veg & vegan option + pastries and really good coffee). Eating in Tacoma is good these days.
It was antic and held us over until lunch. We loved our stay here and will continue to tell people about it.
The home is situated in a perfect location with 100% walkability to my favorite parts of SF, and has so much personality and charm. The entry, while shared, still feels extremely private and the room served us perfectly for our overnight stay. The suite is completely updated with high-end fixtures, gorgeous natural light, and complete privacy.
This home is in a great location, a few blocks from the pier and a short Uber ride from LAX. My husband and I just needed a place to crash for a wedding and this place was perfect. It made our weekend getaway feel like a vacation.
Peg and Jeff were very responsive and communicated with us on the day of our arrival and to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. Had a wonderfull stay. Noe Valley is the best area when you dont want the hustle and bustle from Fishermens Warff.
Bonus for all the extra linens, iron and ironing board, and bedding. Elizabeth was a really nice host. Every time we crossed paths she was very warm and welcoming.
Teresa Knight topographical point is ideal for folks wanting a quiet, peaceful place that is close to the beach. Teresa Knight was super responsive and helped out with a few things I had forgotten. And the bathtub!!!
There was a list of tips provided for us to go to eat, get coffee/ drink , etc. Fans of modern architecture will love what has been done in such a tiny cottage. Clean, cozy, comfortable (if you are willing to navigate a tight staircase a few times each day).
The kitchen is complete with stove, oven, microwave, electric refrigerator , cooking ware and utensils. The place is very close to grocery store, some resto and the Belmont Blue station. This is such a great place and I will definitely stay again when i go back to Chicago.
We enjoyed our stay, though it might be a little pricey for the space; it is essentially a well appointed basement apartment where no cooking is allowed. Amazing loft with about a 12 minute ride to downtown Tacoma. The loft felt like a home and we found it difficult to want to leave at times.
The cottage is a delightlful unit in a quiet residential neighborhood that is convenient to major streets and restaurants. The cottage had everything that we needed, including popcorn fresh from theatre, a Keurig coffee maker, regular coffee maker, coffee, drinks (sparkling water/coke), electric kettle, soap, shampoo, recommendation binder/information, TV in cozy living room, closet with a few hangars, built in individual heaters in each room, comfy bed, suitable for a couple, but may be tight for 3 or 4. It has a full kitchen and board games to match.
Enjoyed our visit. Appreciated our own entrance and all the extras, ie. bikes, boogie boards, sunscreen, refrigerator, microwave.
The kitchen is well supplied with pots, pans, utensils for cooking meals and this time we even bbq'd! Geneva is quick to respond to messages and flexible. A great superhost!
! In fact, the day my husband and I were due to arrive I notified the host that my husband was unable to come and that I was bringing another swimming mom with me instead. The host graciously set up another futon bed in the studio (which had to be brought out of storage.).
The position were amazing, and everything inside is new, clean and in great condition. The TV is hooked up to Netflix and Amazon Prime, so we had all the entertainment we needed. We were pleasantly surprised to see that Marcia had setup a donation-based snack and drink bar.
It’s a nice older home, located in a good area, within walking distance to plenty of awesome places. I was able to experience a nice mix of exploring and downtime during my stay. (Also, as a light sleeper I actually slept just fine with the white noise machine on — that was much appreciated).
A huge plus was the bed! 我們於跨新年的半夜入住,抵達時候剛好遇到Elizabeth主人,替我們簡單介紹房間使用｡房間跟照片看起來ㄧ模一樣,位於二樓,浴室就在房間旁邊,睡眠品質非常好,床好睡,沒有噪音｡一樓進門是客廳及廚房,很美麗的佈置及擺設,我們只能停留短暫的一天覺得很可惜｡停車就停在房子外面路邊位置蠻多,離機場開車25分鐘｡住宿附近感覺是很清靜的鎮靠近海邊,悠閒的步調,因為時間緊湊離開前特地繞去看了附近的海灘也很美｡住宿位置很好,環境好,滿分的一次體驗｡We stay after new year  (We have flight next day . location is close to airport about 25mins driving ) When we arrived we met the owner Elizabeth she is very kindly and introduced about the room to us.Room and bathroom was clean and beautiful.
Mona's place was lovely! The screened in porch with hammock where you can look out over a little tributary is so peaceful! The shower is fantastic and the bed was super comfortable.
Stephanie is a lovely host. I stayed at Stephanie's place for about 3 months, so if anyone was going to find something bad about this place, it would have been me. But I never did!
My favorite part about his home was definitely location. Brent was also super accommodating, very responsive, and would check in here and there to make sure we had a pleasant and comfortable stay at his home. Thanks again, Brent!
Plenty for a visit. The location is sooo perfect. Dolores park is spectacular.
This place is just as incredible in real life as it is in the pictures! I was afraid it was too good to be true, but I assure you, it really is that amazing! :) The place is impeccably decorated and our hosts were so welcoming!
She also went above and beyond to provide local tips--her guidebook was amazing. The cottage itself was charming and clean as well as outfitted with everything you might need. The bed was comfortable and easy to nest in the fluffy pillows and duvets.
Loft was perfect option for visiting out Tacoma friend. There were two separate sleeping space at opposite end of huge loft. I slept on the sectional which was super comfy especially with the high end linens provided.
I don’t ever write the views but I was compelled to let you view reappraisal for Bennie Dudgeon’s place. Just stop right now. And book.
All in all, a fantastic AirBnB experience! Cher Alexander is a wonderful host and her place is apparatus wonderfully for guests. You’ll enjoy the freedom of coming and going with keyed entry and plenty of house liberties.
The loft is very close to Downtown and major sights with easy acces to public transportation. Highly recommend.
Thoroughly enjoyed this property! The location was perfect. Cute and quaint with many comforts including bikes and beach gear.
Very easy and accessible which is exactly what we needed as we we're visiting for an outrigger race. Safe neighborhood, left my canoe on the truck overnight with no issues. Thank you Elizabeth!
We were not left short for anything. We explored Downtown Tacoma, Anthem coffee shop, 7 seas brewery, Valhalla coffee and a number of places. The host: Jeni is amazing.
Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach. I'd 100% recommend spending your time at Virginia Beach / Norfolk at Melissa's.
She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. I really wish that I could have stayed here longer, better yet live in a home exactly like hers (that’s how much i love it!!!) I recommend Leslie’s home and hospitality a million times over!
There were also bikes, beach items, towel and other things available to visit the beach and explore. Overall, my family of four (myself, my wife and two kids ages 8 and 12) had a great stay and would definitely return in the future. We highly recommend Arnold Jackson’s place.
Chuck is a wealth of information, cognition , traveled experiences, amazing people he was worked with/for, you will not regret staying here, I promise you. I'm a veteran Airbnb'er and my reviews are always honest to help that next future guest. For what it is worth, we will be back as we have formed a new friend at Wiseacre.
We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus. We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!
We especially appreciated using the bikes to ride along the beach in the morning. After a long drive, it was nice to be able to unwind in the room before going out. I would absolutely recommend these quarters!
This was our first time travelling to San Francisco, and we were very impressed with Tyler’s place. The location is perfect - close to transit to get to “touristy” destinations, but there is lots to see and do in the local neighbourhood as well. The beach, Golden Gate Park and lots of great restaurants (Hook Fish Co., Thai Cottage to name a few) are all within walking distance.
The hosts are kind and attentive. They were flexible with our need for an early arrival time and offered all sorts of tips for navigating the area. The space has divine natural light, is appointed perfectly, and has lovely energy throughout.
The bathroom is cozy and stylishly decorated with a fantastic shower and sink. Thanks again, Neva!
He was very generous in his offer to let us keep our belongings with him for safekeeping while we explored the area for the day, well past our checkout time. We highly recommend this AirBnB! We had a great time in San Francisco based on the tips from Jeffrey.
We would definitely stay here again! Lois Davis’s apartment was exactly as it appears in the pictures, It is beautiful and the perfect place to come home to after a big day exploring in the city. The neighborhood feels so safe you don’t mind walking to nearby restaurants late at night.
Once inside we were amazed on how clean the whole house (including the private bedroom and bathroom) is! Later that day we met Tyler and his partner. They were very friendly and we had a good talk about our trip, traffic, places to see and where to get different kinds of food.
This room has a common wall with the bathroom and a road with moderate traffic outside the bedroom window. The room is equipped with a nice sound machine and earplugs if you’re a light sleeper. While in town I also went to the Olympus women’s spa located 15 minutes away and Southern Kitchen which is down the street.
I appreciated the particular care Crystal Romero took to ensure our comfortable stay. The walk to the beach is short and lets out in kind of a private area since the access is through a regular neighborhood. I had a great stay and would definitely come again
If you’re looking at this and this space is still available, stop what you’re doing and reserve it. Then come back and read all of the 5-star reviews! Shipwatch Retreat is a beautiful, stylish and comfortable place for a break from the mundane or if you want as much out of your lodging as you do from your visit to WA.
Super comfy bed. Kitchen with all the basic requirements. Spacious living area with ‘Netflix-ready’ television.
The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. They had two small children and there was plenty of room for everything that they brought. There is also a nice fenced in backyard life space when the weather is nice for you to enjoy.
Their neighborhood is in an ideal location within walking distance of numerous excellent restaurants, as well as BART. I highly recommend Debra Dibble and Raquel Eastham's place!
the space is roomy, clean, and welcoming. the television has a Fire stick on it so you can access all your favourite apps for television, along with SlingTV for regular channels. Luis Hawkins was very responsive when we needed questions asked, which we really appreciated.
I can’t recommend this place enough! We felt super lucky to have found this place! Thank you for hosting us!
We especially appreciated using the bikes to ride along the beach in the morning. It is a very short walk to the beach and nearby restaurants. I really appreciated the snacks and coffee ready for us when we got there.
And the walkthroughs and notes were all so clever. We also were able to find free parking each day within a few blocks of the place, which was great. Location-wise, it’s great.
Jo's topographic point is centrally located in Tacoma. Jo provides all the amenities one could possibly need and the house is superbly clean. Highly recommended place to stay in if ever visiting Tacoma.
The bathroom was nice too with a great shower head. Angela provided all that you needed to feel at home. The lighting in the bungalow was perfect and so inviting.
We were visiting New York for the first time, and we decided to stay in Queens to experience cordial reception in a more cozy way than a hotel, and staying at Robert Huckabaa's topographic point was a great choice. One day on our way back, we were really tired from walking around Manhattan all day, and as we came out of the subway, got in a taxi and where at the house witihin 3 minutes. There are taxis all the time.
We could not have been more pleased. We loved riding bikes, being one block from the beach and the comfortable bed. I can’t wait to stay here again!
A beautiful place very clean and everything you need. This is a very bright, airy, quiet, roomy and clean place with a real kitchen, outdoor patio, a short walk to the beach in a lovely neighborhood. The hostess is a good and friendly communicator and respectful of privacy.
My husband and I had a lovely stay and really appreciated how well stocked the space was. As person who commutes by foot regularly, I thought it was easy to walk to the Mission District and the BART. The only thing I didn’t love was not having a lock on our bedroom door, though we had no trouble during our stay.
We had a great stay at Tyler's place! The room feels like a really nice hotel room with every thoughtful amenity you could imagine. The fridge was even stocked with local beer and cold beverages.
We used this Airbnb for our last night of vacation when we needed to get to the airport the next morning. We walked to the pier and ate dinner and watched the sunset. We were greeted by Elizabeth and encouraged to get anything we needed from the kitchen or to use her fridge.
Kelly's master suite is a FANTASTIC place to stay in the city. Close to UCSF, public transportation and a wide variety of restaurants and shops between 7th and 9th Avenue in the Inner Sunset district. Check in/out was a breeze and Kelly is highly responsive.
Redondo beach was a great spot, a little quietter spot - away from tons of tourist , but still not far from the more popular area . Janet Luckman is a great Airbnb host. My wife and I have stayed at many Airbnb’s and can honestly say this was our best experience.
We loved getting to chat with her. The cottage was sparkling clean, beautifully decorated, and stocked with any amenity one might need during their stay, be it toiletries, board game /DVDs, or pantry items to snack on! There are lots of sweet helpful signs placed strategically around the space that add a warm, personal touch to the cottage.
The place is clean and homey, with little amenities tucked everywhere but in a comfortable 'lived-in' style. I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the size, layout, and presentation. One of the awesome cute touches they have are post-it notes everywhere, small paper sign that explain things in a sometimes funny manner.
She gave us a tour of the room and told us everything we needed to know. Although we only got to spend one night there we will absolutely book Elizabeth’s place again on our next trip to CA.
All the things you want - good communication, easy check in and out, convenient parking, a beautiful and comfortable space to call "home" for awhile. And then she goes beyond all that and stocks the fridge with delicious foods, thoughtfully selected, so you can enjoy your breakfast or a snack and get a "taste" of the local fare. You won't find a more thoughtful or helpful host or a lovelier space for you stay.
Thank you Jerry and Julie for being such amazing host ! The home was immaculate and is very well taken care of. Being able to look out on the water while enjoying our dinner was absolutely amazing.
Things like bathroom supplies, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips, bandaids, toothpaste or toothbrushs, etc. Not sure if the hosts leave their house whenever they have guests but you do have to enter the host’s main house in order to get to your place downstairs, so that’s a small weird. Overall, it was a great stay for a single night.
The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 minute walk to the local Richard Batton and 10 mins to shop , including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown.
Elizabeth’s home was sparkling clean and next to EVERYTHING! Close to the beach and up the street from a cute center with a lot of restaurants. The house was setup with great security features that helped us feel safe and also made check in easy!
But Heather was still there waiting to show us around and to give us the key. I would definitely stay here again when I come back to visit. Thank you Heather and family for an amazing stay.
We were traveling with our crawling 9-month-old and that’s always a little worrisome for a young mom, but Nina had the place so amazingly clean, it was fantastic. We were excited that the pool was still an option in early October, our little guy LOVED it, and we enjoyed it too, very brisk and refreshing temperature. The kitchen was stocked really well with cooking utensils, and some breakfast options were available, along with a great array of breakfast beverages.
We booked 1 week and had no issues, communication was excellent (George is very friendly and cheerful. Colleen and George were very helpful and always gave us space if we wanted. George very nicely baked up some blueberry muffins, ahh they were amazing I wish we could have some more now  All in all it was one of our favorite Air B&B's visting America.
Great stay! The house is very clean and organized. Elizabeth was friendly and welcoming when we met her.
we were able to drop off our bags earlier the checkin, which was awesome. Keurig,  towels, a fridge, water bottles, and great water pressure in the shower with very easy communication! oh, and the location made it very easy to relax in Hermosa.
We had a great stay at Heather and JP’s. Our schedule was a bit in flux but they were very accommodating to our changing arrival time. The space itself is really a hidden gem tucked away behind a lovely garden for privacy and quiet.
They were very helpful with advice on transportation and food, and great for a general chat as well. Staying with Dennis Steward and Christian was more fun and comfortable than I expected! They shared their local knowledge, homemade bread, common space, and activity recommendations.
Edward Ramsey place is very nice and the location is outstanding, and I know because I grew up here. It’s quiet, convenient, and close the beach. Plus it’s only a short drive to Hermosa and Manhattan Beach.
Elizabeth responded quickly and the king bedroom/bathroom were comfortable and just as described. Check in directions were clear and a big plus that parking was available. Nice host, thanks so much.
Be sure to come here if you want to experience the quieter (better) side of Virginia Beach! Rayford Kelly is a great host and her place is incredibly cozy and very relaxing. The mattress is very comfy, very firm (slept well even though I usually prefer a softer mattress) as is the rest of the room.
Christina was a great host and made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable. The location of the house was fantastic - it was 15 minutes or less from grocery stores, 24 hour fitness, parks, hiking trails, movie theaters, restaurants, etc. Parking in the neighborhood was no issue at all.
This was my first time at Debra Dibble & Arthur Paddick's topographic point . I just loved it!! I regularly come to Tacoma to visit my daughter at college.
We loved everything; from the comfy bed to the amazing shower and the big TV to watch movies late at night coming back from the city! He responded always directly and was very flexible too. Location is also perfect.
We were not left short for anything. We explored Downtown Tacoma, Anthem coffee shop, 7 seas brewery, Valhalla coffee and a number of places. The host: Francis Jones is amazing.
If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable. The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal.
A most remarkable aspect of our stay was the surprisingly numerous items that are available for use, from makeup mirror to the fantastic 3-speed cruiser bicycles, that made our stay so much easier and more pleasant. Omg! I cannot talk highly enough of the place and the hosts!
Whole Foods is just a few short blocks down the hill. Or you can borrow a bicycle and ride over to the Village or to the pier as well. Scott was super nice and flexible and we appreciated being allowed to use the washer dryer.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. Thank you ! !
A very pleasant experience. He was available when needed, but unobtrusive when not. The house is well maintained, in a nice neighborhood with restaurant and shopping within walking distance.
Grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are also within walking distance. I did not use the microwave or mini-fridge, but the fridge is sizable for being mini! Photos and description are accurate.
Cher Alexander is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! She provides a stocked fridge with yogurt, juice, milk, granola, tea, water, fruit, etc. This made our mornings super easy to get in a quick bite and hit the road.
It was the first time that I stayed at a house that was shared by the owner. Scott was there to help us if needed, but was not in our way at all. We loved the location that was walking distance to the pier and to the bike trail.
She lives in a very quiet neighborhood, I stayed with two of my other friends and we did not feel unsafe at all! This small apartment has everything you may need and more!! From restroom amenities to having Apple TV to having small snacks!
The bathroom featured a great shower with all the amenities (body wash, shampoo, conditioner) and good water pressure--because yes, we all know that matters! It is well-decorated, well-lit and felt like home. Everything was brand new!
Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars!
Susan had also prepared her own short review of some of the local restaurants which was extremely helpful. The beds were very comfortable and the space otherwise provided everything we needed. Susan didn’t miss a detail.
Hosts are super responsive and work hard to make your stay great. I highly recommend Proctor Cottage! I chose the place because of the reviews and the pictures.
Relatively quiet area given proximity to major Oakland-Berkeley streets and Rockridge BART station. Lovely going to sleep upstairs with the rain falling. We had a nice time with a day for exploring & a day mostly on site.
Also her dog is such a sweet boy and her cat is so freaking cute! The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. All the little things really made me feel so comfortable (water jug filled and chilled, emergency kit just in case you forgot something, all the makings for a quick coffee and breakfast).
Jeff even allowed a 45 mins late check out because we had a last minute meeting that we needed to finish before leaving. !
We had a fantastic stay at Debra Dibble house. We especially liked Debra Dibble beautiful patio in the morning, where we could watch humming birds while enjoying a cup of coffee. Alejandrina Anderson was very hospitable and friendly, and made us feel right at home.
This place is like your home away from home. The guys very sweetly put out fruit, granola bars, yogurt, milk  and coffee. There even were freezer packs in the freezer.
The lovely courtyard with fish pond and plants is spectacular and the on site laundry much appreciated. The location was particularly close to family for us, but we were also close to public transportation, loved walking to the many nearby shops and restaurants and found parking to be no problem. Mike and Ben were very attentive to our needs and have become good friends.
Tons of activities and restaurants nearby, and just a few blocks away from the beach. I completely recommend staying here!
You can see the ocean from your bedroom window. Shelton Gill saved us from having to rent them, and we enjoyed riding many miles along the beach. Scott is a great host- I give him my highest recommendation!
The artistic touches and the environmental concerns were a plus. We felt like we were guest of Arnold Jackson and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with excess for comfort and enjoyment. You don't need to bring or buy much.
It is as nice as it seems in the pictures. The cottage is well equipped and has also nice supernumerary like beach cruisers, beach towels etc. Tiana was great and helpful host.
What you get is  (1) a large space with a comfortable sofa and bed as well as a table with 2 chairs, (2) a small, separate kitchen with a microwave, sink, and small refrigerator well-stocked with mineral water, juices, yogurt, granola and other items, (3) a bathroom with a very large modern shower, and (4) a beautiful private garden with direct entree from the studio through glass doors. The location is super -- right next to Golden Gate Park and steps away from countless first rate restaurants and bakeries.
City noises- trains, cars, people- but that is fully stated and there are ear plug left for guests for that reason. So I expected it. Communication was EXCELLENT!
Just stayed here a second time. It is just lovely. The bed is celestial .
Angela’s place was wonderful. A lot of Keurig selection and yummy snacks. The area is convenient with walking distance to wholefoods and shops and the pier.
We are glad to have met her on our way out and wish we saw Jesse! Thank you again Neva, we can’t wait to visit soon!
Pictures do not begin to show the beauty of this place. Such a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and fantastic apartment with incredible amenities. We literally didn’t need to worry about a thing!
Peg and Jeff were very responsive and communicated with us on the day of our arrival and to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. The location was fabulous! We highly recommend staying at Peg and Jeff's topographic point .
Traci is a professional chef, and she leaves out breakfast options that make 'continental' blush. We will definitely go back when next in town.
Susan’s home was our first Airbnb experience. She pays attention to every detail, and you can tell that she LOVES what she’s doing because it is clear that heart and soul went into making this space a truly charming experience for any houseguest. She provided snacks and food, coffee, and beverages.
Neva’s place was conveniently located for a week of traveling around the LA area. We would highly recommend staying here!
When I first got there, Sheri Vowell greeted and acquainted me with the place. My favorite parts are the loft bed (heads up you do need to climb a ladder) & outdoor shower. There's clean towels, a kitchenette (no stove), tea, coffee and even excess toiletries to use if you need.
I'm a veteran Francis Jones and my reviews are always honest to help that next future guest. Oh by the way, 5 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from literally everything (food, shopping, historic sites, gardens, etc...); I now understand why this property is voted by Airbnb a top USA Property - it really is AMAZING!
If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.
Location is in a very safe quite vicinity . Can walk around late at night without problem. Room was super clean and comfortable bed.
I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list. Loved the extra blankets to snuggle up on the couch. television is HUGH!
Close to Train Station. Beautiful houses and yards in the neighborhood made my walk to the train station very enjoyable. Thank you Igor.
Staying at Lori Stewart’s place is an A+ experience. As a visitor to South Bay, Los Angeles, you couldn’t ask for a sweet situation! I cannot wait to return!
If you’re visiting San Francisco for the first time I absolutely recommend staying at Tyler’s home, just make sure you check out Outerlands (across the street) for the best brunch in the city! The description of the apartment is very accurate and in the folder he has prepared, you can find any information you need about the apartment but also the neighborhood and useful tips for San Francisco. This place is like a home, with all necessary amenities, bed linen, towels, a fully equipped kitchen, a washer and a dryer.
The outdoor shower was a great extra feature— we were a little doubtful about showering in the chilly evening , but the hot shower with surrounding fairy lights was HEAVENLY. Also, the process of checking in and out was super easy and fast. We loved our stay at Elizabeth Jones's place and would highly recommend this rental.
All of the recommendations he provided were first rate. It's very easy to get to the main attractions using public transport or you can walk to Mission and explore all the wonderful murals in the neighbourhood. Highly recommended.
This space is beautiful and private. Robert Huckabaa has thought ahead to make the rooms welcoming and comfortable, well-stocked with anything you might need for your stay. There is a little market within walking distance with a lovely coffee shop (I love coffee - big bonus for us).
We were “cool” from there. The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a bike shop close by called Switching Gears. We rented a couple of bikes and rode thru the state park and to the boardwalk.
We had a great stay at Logan Square. Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help. Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy vicinity around half an hr from Downtown on the train.
Inside was soooo clean. Light space. GREAT television .
Thank you is not enough Gloria! The place itself is beautiful--spacious, stylish, comfortable, with a lot of attention to detail and very very clean. Gloria is a great host and replies back to any questions immediately.
We drove a few minutes, parked near the station, and caught a train that got us to the heart of the city in 30 minutes. Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc.
We highly recommend this home for your stay in the area and will definitely be back one day! This house is absolutely beautiful. Every detail is thought out.
Great food & drinks & several theaters within 3 blocks in any direction. The neighborhood is on the upswing and there are so many cool antique shops and small businesses everywhere. Very friendly folks.
The location allowed us to easily reach Manhattan by subway. Being able to do laundry is always a great perk when traveling for several weeks. The host was quick to respond to our question .
Fantastic place with many beautiful and funny details. I especially loved all the different kinds of lamps and the green plants. The neighborhood is buzzing.
Added bonus was the $12 uber (cheap!) My aunt and I had a really great time! Wish we could have explored the antique shops.
Christina's place is GREAT. So clean, lovingly furnished and well appointed with coffee, mugs, spectacles , plush towels. The location is antic and the sunrise... do get up early to see the pink morning light over Puget Sound.
We arrived from the airport at 11am. We walked straight down avenue A to the walkway. Its a great way to see the sunset!
Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city. Thanks Anne for a lovely stay!! !
The bungalow is very comfortable and clean in a great location for visiting LA and the beach. And you could not ask for a better host! !
They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. This is the fourth year I've stayed at Susan's Charming Proctor Suite. It has become my home away from home.
What a delight to be in a private area, yet still feel part of nature. The shower is hot, the towels fluffy and warm. We also love the compost toilet.....very easy to use, hygienic, no odor and very ecological.
This was my second time using Air Bnb and my mother’s first and we both absolutely loved the Cozzy Cottage experience! We traveled all the way from New Jersey and this place literally felt like our home away from home. The neighborhood is super cute and most important, very safe.
Tammy’s place is 2 blocks from the beach and about a 5 minute walk from the downtown Hermosa area. This place is absolutely perfect! Clean, cozy, private, amenities, bicycles, coffee machine, microwave and a small fridge in the room.
It's a cute, cozy, and very clean cottage/cabin. The kitchen is well supplied with pots, pans, utensils for cooking meals and this time we even bbq'd! She also stocks the freezer with coffees and gluten free breads!
There is a manual of 'rules' on the table and I was thinking that it was going to be one of 'those kind' but when I opened it - it really was a how-to guide on how to make yourself at home. So I did. I started to get nosy and open everything and got loads of brilliant surprises, all sorts of games and fun things to find.
Michael is an absolutely wonderful host; his work and art literature can be found spread all over the studio, it is quite inspiring. For those that want a real cultural Chicago experience, this place is it. I am already booking my next trip and staying here.
The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked. The location was very close to the beach. We decided to take our car to the beach when we went, but we didn’t necessarily have to.
The room itself is so spacious and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. I like to walk to cafes and shops, but this location isn’t for doing that. There is plenty within a short drive though.
There is a walk out private porch. This was my first experience with Airbnb. It was great, the place is very lovely with an amazing neighbourhood.
Shantell Preusser was the most gracious, amusing , warming, magical host. In our 4.679 years of dating this was the best topographic point for us to retreat, recover, and nourish our soul . I will be back over and over and over again.
Beautiful room, sparkling clean and large shower with immediate hot water, comfortable bed with high-quality linens, public transportation easily available, close to several coffee shops and yummy bakeries, easy walk to Golden Gate Park, close to Safeway, and immediate response from Joan Litwin to any request. No noise; felt very secluded even though the place was right in the middle of everything. The breakfast items that were available to us, plus the bottled water, were very much appreciated.
Coffee shop , grocery stores, and restaurant are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). I hope to be back soon! Thank you for welcoming us, Joelle!
Arthur Paddick's place is a nice, cozy space. The noise did not bother me one bit and Arthur Paddick provides white noise machines just in case the noise is a bit bothersome. The bed is super comfortable and the kitchenette is great for heating up some food or making something small.
He showed me the flat and gave recommendations when I arrived. If I come back to Chicago, I will happily stay there again :-)
She provided us with breakfast (yogurt and granola), tea, coffee and fruits! Throughout our stay, she was always there to respond to any questions or concerns we had. She was always very sweet and kind to us.
He really has thought of everything and has equipped the room and en-suite with all the necessities for guests. The apartment is well located and is in walking distance to the trendy Mission District. Tyler has a lot of useful tips to share for tasty restaurants and bars.
Great location. Very convenient to lots of stores and the pier/beach. So many nice touches and the owner is always available via phone to address any concern.
Bed was so comfy, I slept great! And of course, the patio was AMAZING! Great vibe.
Everything was brand new! Some of the best details are not currently featured in the photos, so I'd like to call them out: next to the fridge was a cute baker's rack with everything you could possibly need--mugs, cups, wine glasses, plates, bowls, silverware--you name it. They also offered a variety of tea and starbucks ground coffee--as well as sugar, creamer etc.
There's no wonder why she's called a SUPERHOST and always booked! Pictures are accurate, and if anything kind of undersell the place. It’s more spacious than it looks.
The house is in a quite neighborhood. Whole Food is only a few hounded feet away. We walked on the pier almost everyday, listened to the wave and watched the dolphin jumping.
Everything was well equipped. Dorothy Moser was a great host and made certain I had everything I needed to be comfortable. She recommended some great places to check out in Oakland during my visit.
Francis Jones place is easily the nicest airb&b we have stayed in. A really fantastic experience! !
There is too much fun to be had hanging out in this area of town. It’s very close. Loads of good bars and food.
It was so wonderful to have a chance to stay with Zeena again... and a great way to introduce my husband to Airbnb! The private room is quiet and has a very comfortable bed! Ensuite bath with lovely amenities provided.
The best part: I was able to bring my dogs! Fantastic hosts and will be back!! Thank you again guy for making my family trip wonderful!
They shared their local cognition , homemade bread, common space, and activity recommendations. They were available to chat and debrief after a full day's activities, but not overbearing at all! I would love to come again if I'm back in the SF/Oakland area.
Tyler is a wonderful host! Needless to say when we come back to SF, we will stay here again! :)
The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. The book of local recommendations were such a nice added bonus along with the booklet of their favorite SF public spaces. Just overall a well thoughtout and quaint Airbnb experience.
Had the best time! Erik Dickson had amazing hospitality, explained a bunch of things to us upon arrival and was very good at communicating! A perfect topographic point for a couple people for a getaway.
), coffee station, wine bottle donation option, sweet WiFi, bathroom soaps and toiletries, slippers and robes... to even just leaving the light on for us each night so we could be welcomed home properly!!! Just so much thought went into creating the amazing guest experience here. And the walkthroughs and note were all so clever.
The walk to the beach is short and lets out in kind of a private area since the entree is through a regular neighborhood. Robert Turpen An place is ideal for folks wanting a quiet, peaceful place that is close to the beach. It's definitely walkable (2 long blocks), but having a car was great and allowed me to check out the beautiful trails of First Landing State Park.
It truly felt like a home away from home. We had such a wonderful experience at this amazing space! We realized right away that Bob and Sharann could easily charge twice the amount they are asking for each night, just because of the value of the place alone.
The room itself is bigger than I expected, which was nice as my husband ended up needing to do some work. Elizabeth's place is tucked into a neighborhood, but walking distance to the harbor and beach. We also walked to a great pancake place about 1/2 mile south on PCH (Wildflower Cafe, I believe).
Do expect to walk up a slope and climb stairs to get to the entrance and another flight to the room. The room was super cosy and had everything that we needed. Thoughtful touches included a nicely designed welcome magazine orienting you to the house, facilities and neighbourhood, providing snacks, drinks, ear plugs, white noise speaker and Apple TV.
Marc was very helpful at check in, the topographic point was well stocked, getting to ride the motorcycle and having a parking pass was very thoughtful. A great topographic point and we'll be back for sure! !
Paul’s place is exceeding . It’s located in a great location, very walkable area. The place is very stylist, extremely clean, and offers all the comforts you’d need.
Tyler has a lot of useful tips to share for tasty restaurants and bars. Would definitely like to stay again, and would highly recommend that you do.
We had a great time at Scott's place. It was great. Super close to Redondo beach and really peaceful location.
And fun to look around at the art they are creating in the space when its not being rented to outside folks. The loft was a fantastic place for hanging out, playing some pool, watching some movies and just restful . The location worked well since my son was in Seattle the night before so had a quick walk from the Amtrak station stop in Tacoma to the apartment.
Short walk to beach and restaurant . Rayford Kelly was a marvelous host and made us feel completely welcome.
There is a walk out private porch. This was my first experience with Airbnb. It was great, the topographic point is very lovely with an amazing neighbourhood.
Great place to stay. The unit was so quiet at night that I didn't have any issues falling asleep (and I'm a light sleeper too!). Host was very nice and informative.
Wow, what can I say! Like all their other guests, I agree this home is spectacular for its location, privacy, comfort, and the most hospitable hosts. The garden is so peaceful and lovely in the morning where we had morning coffee.
We loved Roberta Hallenbeck’s cute bungalow and our only sorrow is we didn’t have more time to enjoy the good location and the cunning back patio. Roberta Hallenbeck went above and beyond providing amenities, the bungalow was extremely comfortable and clean, and I would absolutely stay again! It was the perfect topographic point for my coworker and I to relax while in town for a conference and still feel like we were enjoying the good LA vibe.
It truly felt like a home away from home. We had such a wonderful experience at this amazing space! We realized right away that Sheri Vowell and Deborah Hines could easily charge twice the amount they are asking for each night, just because of the value of the place alone.
The shower was hot and we appreciated the tea and coffee in the morning. I parked a car and it was very easy to find parking. I left before the street parking time limit kicked in so this wasn't an issue for me.
the room is huge, cleaned and beautiful with a big super comfortable bed. You will find everything you may need (like hairdryer, iron...). Elizabeth was nice with us.
We used the cruiser bikes daily for rides to the Pier for brunch or Hermosa for fresh oysters. Paul is an incredibly friendly and welcoming host who will help you find the best spots in town. Pro tip: we found a great gluten free spot, Arthur Paddick, just a few min by car from the house.
I would reccomend this loft to anyone staying in Tacoma. Absoslutely worth it. Thank you is not enough Gloria!
The flower vines were in bloom, the view walking up onto the deck and the details of decor even on the outside let us know this place was special! It is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, cozy and the linens are top notch. Tony and Attina were there as needed, friendly when we saw them and eager to make our stay fantastic, even giving us a late check out which was very much appreciated.
The grounds are dramatic and vast with something to peek your interest at every turn. The home itself is so incredibly spectacular with the intent of Frank Lloyd Wrights' unique architecture of bringing the outside into the home. Morning sunrise and evening sundown are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area.
The neighborhood is quaint and quiet, and the space was marvelous. Of particular note was a most excellent shower - an area that can be shoehorned in at some other places, especially when the rental has been crafted out of a basement or attic. This shower was spacious, clean, substantial, with great water pressure.
We felt more than safe coming in and out of Ken & Curt’s coach house and felt safe knowing they were close by. Thank you guys again for having us!
Bed was super comfy and the amenities top notch! Marc and Tammy are the most welcoming and accommodating hosts. Marc gave us great tips for where to go and what to do in and around Hermosa and Manhattan Beach, and was very responsive if we had any questions.
There was a full fridge, microwave, toaster oven, hot plate for cooking, plenty of dishes for eating. The bed was super comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and warm blankets. The highlight of our trip, for sure.
This little cottage is nestled in the back of Angela’s lot. When we walked back we were greeted by the delicious smell of different flowers growing overhead and around the yard. There is a private courtyard for the cottage with an orange tree and a lovely sitting area.
We were so pleased with everything else, we would forfeit those for what we did have. Oh, and we LOVED having Netflix available. This was Brian and mine once a year get away from the responsibilities of life (kids, dogs, careers) and we loved the ability to “Netflix and chill” w each other.
This is exactly how it’s described! This is my favorite Airbnb I’ve stayed at! I had a wonderful 3 days and can’t wait to go back again!
Our daughter and her boyfriend came up from LA to join us. The three sleeping area each had very comfortable beds, good pillow , and plenty of blankets of varying weights. Each bathroom was large with large, fluffy towels, shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash.
Stayed at this place to surprise my boyfriend for our anniversary and he was blown away by how gorgeous and spacious the loft was! Gloria is also a very friendly and helpful host who communicates and responds quickly. It definitely felt like a home away from home!
Jodi Stallings called me day of to see if I wanted an early check-in and also to confirm my muffin choice. The communication and welcoming environment is just wonderful. I will always be checking here first for availability when I am back in the area.
Absolutely perfect. Location was amazing with lots of great restaurants in the area. The space was clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable.
The home is located in a nice quiet residential area and there is plenty of street car parking for those renting a car. She and her family are such amazing people and made our stay a memorable one. Also this home isn’t far from San Francisco it was a quick 15-20 minute drive.
We loved everything here, from your hospitality, attention to details, the unit location that is few minutes walk to Ashby bart station, the extra personal touch like complimentary basic food for guests,...... the list goes on. Both me and my wife love the way you decorated your unit and its cleanliness. We love to use  your kitchen too.
The place is decorated super cute and trendy. This was our first Airbnb stay and our first time to Norfolk! We had such a fantastic time.
The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. He provides full use of his kitchen, even offering eggs, bread, and lots of pots, pans, and kitchen utensils. We kept a deep-dish pizza in his refrigerator and microwaved it in the morning to eat, using his kitchen knives and plates.
It takes 30 min. by subway (the nearest metro is 10 min walk). For us a perfect stay for a wounderful time in NYC.
We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing. Unfortunately due to delayed luggage we lost some time and didn't get to explore as much as planned. Deborah Hines was very friendly and offered if we needed any extra supplies due to the lost luggage.
Walking on the beach in the morning and watching surfers out on the water was a real treat!! We can't wait to come back to San Francisco and stay here again!!! Thanks Heather!
What can I say about heather... she is really a super host !!!!!!! Go there and be prepared to feel like being at home or maybe sometimes better !!!! Ps: To buy a muni ticket for the days you stay in Sf is for me the best way to be mobile in the city.
Julia and Adriana are amazing hosts! If you are visiting Oakland/SF and want to be close to OAK, Oracle Arena/Coliseum--this is where you want to be! I came to Oakland to attend a concert and was blown away by the studio.
At high tide you can't access the beach, but there are chairs on the bulkhead so you can still sit and enjoy the water. I saw seals or sea lions out in the water every day I was there. I hope to be back in the summer months!
I really wanted to ride a bike on the boardwalk, but didn't have time, so I guess I'll be back! My bf and I stayed at Scott's place for 3 nights and were very very comfortable and entertained. :) The Alexa gadget was really cool to have around, especially in an unfamiliar locale if you want to ask it questions about historic weather, population, about the forecast, and my bf needs white noise to sleep so it even does that.
And I highly recommend a low-key bike ride up and down The Strand. I don't know if it would be too hectic in the busy summer months, but it was a perfect way to laze-away a sunny spring afternoon.
Angela is a very warm and responsive host and added little touches to make us feel welcomed and at home. She has created a cozy place perfect for a couple’s retreat.
All of the recommendations he provided were first rate. It's very easy to get to the main attractions using public transport or you can walk to Mission and explore all the fantastic mural in the neighbourhood. Highly recommended.
The shared patio was a really nice place to relax after a day at the beach, the area is nice with a relaxed vibe and it was so much fun playing with her puppy!! Neva’s place was perfect for my husband and I’s little beach getaway. It’s close enough to walk to shops, restaurants and the beach.
The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. Great restaurants and shops are a short walk away, great views as you walk outside and the decor was also - comparable to any nice hotel. The added amenities, like the coffee and tea and the record player and collection of records were wonderful additions too!
Lois Davis's loft is simply beautiful, clean and exactly as pictured. Many tourist spots were just a 15-20 minute walk away and it was also close to the riverwalk. There are many good restaurant and bars near by, easily in a perfect location.
The informal dining table in the kitchen worked well for us when dining at home. The bedroom with queen bed and bathroom/shower were all on the cozy side, but the two of us managed just fine. The queen bed was quite firm but also comfortable, and we slept great.
I loved the personalized welcome and quick response whenever we had a question, as well. We enjoyed our stay at Stephanie's apartment. The location was perfect for us as we come to Tacoma to visit family in the Proctor area, a short drive away.
I loved the loft room with its lovely linens, comfortable bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light. I will absolutely be returning to have another restful stay and see the new additions/ change that have been made to this ever evolving space.
This place is lovely. It’s a very clean and well restored apartment. The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level.
This is an amazing find in a city crowded with excellent listings. Check-in was seamless and Tyler's done a fantastic job adding small touches that make a big difference. The rest of the apartment is just as welcoming.
This location is so very convenient, parking is steps away, private, room and amenities are all there for any traveler tourist or business. The cherry on top is Paul who provides all the information you'll ever need for the surrounding area. I'm still full from all the wonderful restaurants he recommended.
It was clean, spacious and was safe for a single person's stay. I would recommend to friends, family and people reading this to stay at Betty Maust for a cost effective, fun, safe and beautiful place to relax and enjoy Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, etc., and LA!
We felt like we were guest of Mark and Raquel Eastham's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. It's a comfortable space in a very convenient location (quick walk to BART station) on a quiet street, and had everything we needed, and more, to make us feel right at home. We slept like logs in the extremely comfortable bed.
We had a delightful chat, and I felt like I was staying with new friend . I highly recommend their home to others.
She also provides us with bicycles so we can took a bike trip along Redondo Beach and Manhattan beach. I can’t wait to visit her next time!
Puerto Rican restaurant abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout.
The kitchen and living areas are comfortable (only two chairs at the table, though) and nicely decorated. The bed is under the eaves, so watch your head! The bathroom is part of the bedroom, with no door separating the two, though the toilet is mostly hidden behind the sink, and there is a door between the bedroom and the living room.
We enjoyed our stay at Rod's place! The location worked well. Not far from the metro , walking distance to many attractions, and several restaurants and convenience stores right there in case we needed something.
Jerry & Julie have created a masterpiece with this home. The layout and design of the house is tailor-made for guests with families, or couple looking for a quiet retreat. The bedrooms have plenty of room, the bathrooms are spacious and the living room is cozy with a warm fireplace.
Great location, great comforts , clean, great accomadations and recommendations! 20-30 minutes from Santa Monica, Downtown LA, and Hollywood.
We absolutely loved  Michael’s place. The very huge Loft is artistically and tastefully furnished. The wide roofgarden filled with a hundred of flowerpots is the best location during breakfast and evening hang out .
If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a bit tricky on the streets, especially late at night. We would definitely recommend this place and neighbourhood. Precita Park Cafe is 2 blocks away and the coffee & breakfast sandwiches are amazing!
Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. If you have any questions or concerns the response is very quick. Highly recommend, and planning on coming back.
We much preferred the Chesapeake Bay beach (almost no people) near Chris and Tim's cottage. Vicki and Rick - San Diego, CA
Paul's topographic point offered  even more than we expected. Everything felt brand new and stylish, spotlessly clean, quiet, comfortable and safe. It is a spacious feeling studio with many special touch and comforts to make you feel at home.
Would highly recommend From the very start Bob and Shantell Preusser were warm and welcoming. They made sure our stay was everything we wanted it to be!
Angela’s place was exactly as-described, and exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for in an AirBnB for a first-time trip to San Francisco. All-in-all a very cool spot that’d be perfect for either personal or business travel. Angela was also immediate with her responses, and helpful with her tips.
They have considered everything and even left a bottle of wine. I can see why their place is booked solid. If you see an opening do not hesitate.
The room was impeccably clean, spacious, quiet, and VERY comfortable, with beautiful linens and decor. The location is prime—within walking-distance to the Redondo Pier and within in a beautiful neighborhood setting. If I am fortunate enough to be back in the area, I will DEFINITELY stay here again!
Instant smile when I arrived. The location was great and the privacy was perfect. The hosts were amazing at accommodating any needs I had and were always quick to respond if I had any question .
We had a great stay at T’s this past weekend! Accessibility Note: The only thing I do want to mention, as one of the main reasons we booked this Airbnb was because it was listed as “step free”, is that there is a small step to enter the Airbnb that I was not able to independently navigate in my manual wheelchair. Still a 5 star Airbnb - but would be important for other wheelchair users to know.
We had a great stay at Logan Square. Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help. Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train.
AND THE BED! So comfy!! We got a wonderful nights sleep.
So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe . So your place very  amazing  it’s worth every penny that I spend. I know that the  Quality  That I got can’t beat it in a hotel even a  Waldorf Astoria.
Please don’t hesitate in choosing to stay at Jeff’s place. The location is fantastic and safe. There’s a great coffee place and supermarket across the road.
I would definitely come back and stay here again!! Pamela Drew even allowed a 45 mins late check out because we had a last minute meeting that we needed to finish before leaving. Thanks so much for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home!
We loved this place! We loved the bathroom - the shower is so beautiful. Bed is massive and so comfy too!
Although, we had our own supplies it was just convenient knowing that the supplies were there if we needed it. Last, but not least the sky view of the place is absolutely breathtaking. How beautiful to wake up to and go to sleep to the beautiful view.
It was sparkling clean and stocked with everything you’d need from keurig coffee and granola parallel bars to maps and information about the city. I appreciate their recommendations for the area and their help carrying my baggage up the hill and back from where I parked. Love that there is street parking!
Also Pamela Drew goes above and beyond to provide extra amenities that made us feel at home. All in all we had an amazing time and would absolutely come back!
I really enjoyed my stay at Dan & Traci's. I was in town on business and the location was great for driving to Oakland and El Cerrito where I was working. In the evenings I enjoyed being able to walk around the lovely neighborhood and to College Ave where there were lots of nice shops and restaurants.
The loft is very spacious, stylish, comfortable, surprisingly private despite the location, and secure. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom up-to-date with an excellent shower, very clean… We had everything we needed. Brian and Hillary were very helpful, checking in by text to make sure all was well.
I love that I was welcomed to utilize the living room, kitchen, and patio area. Everything was well equipped. The room itself is nice and clean, and the pillow was comfortable .
PERFECT place to say in SF. ace clean. Entry is easy with coded lock - location is excellent, close to Dolores Park, BiRite market and Pizzeria Delfina and so many other great walkable places between the Mission and Dennis Steward.
Clifford Winkler’s place was an easy walk to my venue on the beach. The bed was especially luxurious – enourmous with super high-quality sheets and blankets and a broad assortment of pillow . The master suite was private and massive and gorgeous and super high-quality.
We really enjoyed staying at Robert Huckabaa's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday.
Crystal Romero greeted me warmly with her ace sweet doggie. Crystal Romero's place was cozy and very clean. Crystal Romero also had thoughtful extras such as a basket of travel item in case guests forgot something - which I did so I appreciated the lotion.
Highly recommended !! Tammy and Marc were really kind, nice and helpful! The place is cosy in a very nice location, close to the beach.
This is my second stay and it is as perfect as the first. My husband’s health took a turn and Kara and Nick took the tome to listen to the ramblings of this middle aged lady after a very long day. They even offered their laundry facilities!
Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood. We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.
Their home is lovely, and the room is clean, light, with plenty of room for 1 or 2 people. Their bedroom is across the hall, but I never saw them; they know how to provide privacy. The bathroom is just down the hall, & you don't have to share it.
Heated floors, a fireplace, fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. My colleagues and I kept looking around saying, "I love this place. I don't want to leave".
Linda's place is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museums. There were snacks and a bottle of water in the bedroom (no plastic - yeah!). The kitchen was new, and Linda made space in her freezer so we could refreeze our ice for the ice chest.
Neva's topographic point is a perfect studio in Redondo Beach. Looking forward to our next trip to the area so we can stay here again.
Shelton Gill and Sheri Vowell have truly thought of every detail to make it a comfortable stay. Great stay with Sheri Vowell and Shelton Gill! Awesome space for 2 and a great location.
Thank you, Joan Litwin and Charlotte, for providing your amazing home as a wedding venue. All of our guests commented on this unique and stunning property which allowed both intimacy and plenty of space to spread out. The accommodations were comfortable and we enjoyed the eye candy of lake views from the expansive living room windows.
Incredible design, and extremely comfortable. I loved this topographic point and definitely recommend staying here! Again, such a lovely space.
The house was cosy and beautiful, & it’s so nicely decorated! Looks so much better in real life as compared to the photos! Requested for some fire log on our last night to set a little fire outside the house, and Deborah Hines was so fast in helping us to set it up after hearing our request, he even went ahead & hang some pretty lights outside for us, really makes us feel so happy!
Luis Hawkins and Marc are exponential on what they do and are by far the most amazing and accommodating hosts ever. The room has all it needs and is centrally located within walking/biking/driving distance to all but seems like an oasis all on its own. Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any!
There are bicycles, a beach wagon, beach chairs, beach umbrellas in the shed outside. You will love it!! !
However, this ended up being something I loved. If you like to stay in places that are just as interesting to look at as to stay in, this is one you should check out. If you like and appreciate thoughtful modern design, you need to stay here.
Thank you so much for your amazing hospitality. Tyler has done an exceptional job of curating a beautiful and peaceful space for his guests. He has thought through every single detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robes - he has anticipated his guests' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special.
I recently stayed at the Private Cozy Cottage a 2nd time, from Jan 30th to Feb 6th. And I was not disappointed at all. Heather really knows how to take care of her guests.
 small things like the coffee and bikes really made you feel at home. We would love to stay with them again.
Bennie Dudgeon is nicest of hosts! From the moment I arrived It felt like I was staying at a friend’s house. We hit it off right away and even talked in kitchen for a while before I unloaded my car and got a tour of the house!
The suite is completely updated with high-end fixtures, gorgeous natural light, and complete privacy. Michael Krieg is extremely accommodating for check-in and check-out and highly communicative with prompt, informative responses. He was very generous in his offer to let us keep our belongings with him for safekeeping while we explored the area for the day, well past our checkout time.
We loved our stay at this cute and stylish studio. Loved the size of the bathroom and shower. The studio was clean and had many great amenities like a heater, fan, and humidifier.
Clifford Winkler topographic point was great for our weekend beach getaway! The room is very large and offers a double vanity sink, large shower and a nice balcony to sit on and take in the views. Coming and going was very easy.
It is easy to come and go and she respects your privacy if that is your wish. I really loved it here. 5/5 would stay again.
We prefer this location to many other neighborhoods - Noe Valley, North Beach, Richmond, Marina, even Pacific Heights. Just find a parking space and forget the car - home of Uber and Lyft, so easy! Proximity to the beach and Golden Gate Park are huge pluses!
The day of the trip, I realized that the cabin was only supposed to welcome 2 people so I told Miranda Malone, and he was very nice at accommodating this last minute change. Miranda Malone came to welcome us when we arrived. An amazing experience.
We arrived to a fresh baguette on the counter and milk in the fridge for our coffee. The studio could not be more centrally located with Bart just down the street, Oakland to the south and Berkeley to the north. A lot of coffee shops, restaurants and parks surround this neighborhood.
Location is seriously second to none. Convenient access to multiple restaurants and coffee shops. Parking was as easy as it comes in San Fran.
And fun to look around at the art they are creating in the space when its not being rented to outside folks. Easy entree to the highway was convenient and worked well for us. Our lone wish, was that it was in a location that had some more food/drink options and more foot traffic to feel safer.
She welcomed and treated us like friends. Elizabeth’s home is exactly that, a home. With the house being two blocks from the beach, you can go for a nice run along the coast to Redondo pier and back while enjoying an amazing view.
There is an entry room with couch, then walk through the main bedroom/living area to get to the dining room/kitchen, and at the end of the kitchen is the bathroom. Some really great food choices around here, it was easy to feed 4 of us either out or in the apartment. Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at.
Dennis Steward is great at communication and gets back with you within the hour. I highly recommend this clean, spacious, quiet studio on the ground floor of a classic San Francisco house in the Inner Richmond District. What you get is  (1) a large space with a comfortable sofa and bed as well as a table with 2 chairs, (2) a small, separate kitchen with a microwave, sink, and small refrigerator well-stocked with mineral water, juices, yogurt, granola and other items, (3) a bathroom with a very large modern shower, and (4) a beautiful private garden with direct access from the studio through glass doors.
Thank you, Edwin Green. We chose Edwin Green’s topographic point because of the bikes he had available, and ended up loving everything about the place! Great location and amenities.
My husband and I travel a lot and I can say conclusively this was the most adorable place we have ever stayed in. If you appreciate fine detail, this is the place to stay! It was just a short walk to the beach, ecological preserve (hiking), and good restaurants.
We really enjoyed that. We'd definitely stay here again! Sheri Vowell much more like a cute little hostel so we didn't feel like we were invading anyone's personal home.
If you are wondering whether or not to book your stay here, stop and just do it. She is an excellent host, cook and interior designer. The breakfast alone worths the money.
The view toward the garden in the back of the house is  amazing and the whole ambience is very peaceful. Nina's place is in a quiet location and beautiful apartment. The apartment is comfortable and quaint.
The suite is amaizing and I have no words to describe the bathroom! I had not the opportunity to meet Kelly, however my partner did it. She was very nice and helpful.
The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the vicinity nor get to ask for vicinity tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!
Tyler himself is very accommodating and gave us loads of useful tips on our first day of how to get around, useful apps and even gave us great recommendations for what we should do on our first day. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again without hesitation. Thanks for everything Tyler!
What a treasure this was. She gives new meaning to the term "super host"!
Tiana could not have been better! If it were up to me, I would live in the little casita forever!
The desk has been moved closer to the door, which makes it a convenient spot to place your keys or bags. I'm looking forward to coming back--now that I've found this gem, I can't wait for the next concert at Oracle!
If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll definitely look into staying at Crystal Romero and Traci’s place and give myself more time to soak it in. There were lots of nice touches and this had more of a bed and breakfast vibe to it. Thank you Crystal Romero and Traci!
Gin and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! It was quite warm when we were there and the AC in the room was great. Meatball is the cutest (loudest) house greeter ever, we love him!
Nina and Merv really take pride in their property and are so generous. Having the puzzles and drawing books was fun as well. Thank you so much.
There is an entry room with sofa , then walk through the chief bedroom/living area to get to the dining room/kitchen, and at the end of the kitchen is the bathroom. Raquel Eastham provided us with local baked yummies, coffee, teas, juice, milks, fruits, oatmeal, yogurts, boiled eggs- very well stocked for breakfast. But no cooking, so we ate out for lunch and dinner, called ubereats once.
Big room with a king bed, master bath. Jodi Stallings was a wonderful host! Her topographic point makes you feel right at home.
Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city. Bed was comfortable, pillows were pretty flat but not terrible. The place was very clean and I felt safe the entire time with a secure lock on our bedroom door.
Very comfortable, stylish, clean apartment. Small snacks (chips, granola bars) were unexpected and very welcome - we were running late for an event when we arrived and weren't sure we'd be able to eat dinner that night. Easy walk to the L and more food.
It was such a warm genuine welcome. This was my 3rd visit to the little house and I'm already looking forward to my next visit! Erica always goes above and beyond to make sure that each and every guest is comfortable - plus the extra touches are like nothing else I've ever experienced in an AirBnb!
We had a wonderful time at T's home. Everything was very clean and functional. The location is great, as it is walking distance to the beach.
Very clean apartment; convenient location. I was the only person in the apartment which was fine; good for a few days stay. A couple would need to be close to be comfortable, in my view.
The space itself is really a hidden gem tucked away behind a lovely garden for privacy and quiet. Just a note to be careful on the steps approaching the bed/loft area and to watch your head as it’s a bit of a low clearance. We had an easy time street parking our car directly outside the unit which was extremely convenient and one less thing to have to worry about.
LOVED my first stay and can’t wait to return. The perfect beach cottage close to any and everything with all the comforts of home. Park right next to the cottage, drop your bags and relax.
Some reviewers and Jose himself mentioned that he and his family live above the apartment but we barely heard them to be honest. Excellent value for money!
The pictures do not do this space justice, not to mention the good vibes too. We will be back again. :)
It’s bright, clean and Marc supplies you with just about everything you need, to have a nice, comfortable stay. We live in a very quiet neighborhood in Phoenix so the noise out on the street, definitely caused us to not have as restful of a night’s sleep as we had hoped. Our night was garbage night and the process by the city sanitation workers out on the street, was fairly involved & loud.
Thank you, Scott. Scott is great at communicating and very helpful if asked for local tips on what to do/where to go!
Jo's place is centrally located in Tacoma. Jo provides all the amenities one could possibly need and the house is superbly clean. Highly recommended place to stay in if ever visiting Tacoma.
She was a great and responsive host. This is a GREAT AirBnb if your coming into the the San Fran area!! Jeremy Johnson has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and relaxing!
We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Mona's place again! The place is decorated super cute and trendy. It felt like we were staying in a Pinterest/Instagram dream.
We loved this place! It has everything you need from lotion to shampoo, coffee, chocolates on the pillows and Netflix. We felt very much at home.
Amazing beach cottage! Tiana is an awesome host !She waited for us when we first day checked in just want to say hello to us and show around her house to make sure everything is OK to us｡Very nice lady!We love her house,everthing is so comfortable!It takes us just few minutes to the beach｡Redondo is a beautiful and quiet place to stay｡you must love here and Tiana‘s property!Highly recommend!
Her place is very well located, very stylish and clean! I would love to come back some day!
Maggie responded quickly to all of my concern . The bed is extremely comfy. We really enjoyed our time in the apartment.
The bathroom is big and nice. The room has everything a normal hotel room would have, and more. Erik Dickson and Marc are very helpful and friendly people World Health Organization are passionate about hosting guest .
Svitlana and Mitch This is a perfect location for a stay in downtown Tacoma. It is convenient to shops and restaurants.
Scott is a great host who has gone above and beyond to create a great experience for his guests. Overall Scott was very helpful and easy to communicate with. He has a beautiful home that is everything pictured and more.
Francis Jones’s a fantastic host and it shows. Great location and the 3 bikes he has for guests came in handy. Very short ride or walk to the beach (less than 2 blocks).
Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessity - so no need to pack or buy any! We can totally recommend staying at Cher Alexander's   topographic point . We really enjoyed our stay and we wish we could have stayed longer.
We were greeted by Elizabeth and encouraged to get anything we needed from the kitchen or to use her fridge. We went to bed early and got up and went to breakfast right down the street and headed straight to the airport. Perfect for what we needed.
This space has everything you could think of that you might require for a few days away. There was good communication with Lois Davis when we were delayed five hours, The cottage was warm clean and welcoming. Having robes in the closet and breakfast supplies for the morning was invaluable after arriving 5 hours later than planned.
My sister was actually the one who found the private cozy cottage for us. I'd like to say it's one of the best places I ever stayed for AirBnb. Lets just say that Heather was awesome!
Even though he had little to no notice we were booking that night he accommodated us and everything was more than perfect! Such a cool host and a experience me and my friends will cherish and remember forever!
We took full advantage of all the vicinity had to offer, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping and more using reference material provided by the hosts. Highly recommend. This is a major value adjustment .
Cher Alexander place is everything you want in a stay away from home. Would definitely recommend!
I plan to make this my go-to when coming back to the area, and wouldn’t hesitate to book again. The experience was great and the host is awesome! Denise was quick to respond and a great host.
I would definitely come back! This was a perfect Airbnb place! It is as nice as it seems in the pictures.
T’s beach cottage was my first airbnb experience and it was amazing! I didnt cook since I was in town for a wedding, but I was still appreciative of the attention to detail. Third, check in/check out was easy: great communication and easy to follow instructions.
Perfect for 2 people. we hopped on the bikes every day and loved the location. The topographic point was so adorable!
Michael even came to join us for a while. The location is fantastic. The apartment is very central and in one of the most popular parts of town.
Quiet, very private, calm . Looks exactly as pictured, lovely and warm. Alejandrina Anderson and Cher Alexander greeted me on arrival, even though it was past stated check-in time, to show us the studio, where everything could be found, and invited me to enjoy their lovely garden (with koi pond) at any time during my stay.
Will be back. We booked their place for a BFF reunion with our 14 year old daughter #girlsonly. The Beach Cottage is the perfect topographic point for a couple or family to stay.
Highly recommended if you are staying in the Redondo Beach area. Very large space and private. Got a great restful night’s sleep, loved the private bath (beautiful shower), and had plenty of room to get repacked for my flight.
The apartment is very central and in one of the most popular parts of town. The down side to that is that the apartment building is right next to a night club, so if you're staying over the weekend you'll hear all the music through the wall as well as the people down on the street (Chicagoans love honking their horns at all hours of the day/night ?!). Michael offers some ear plugs though, so unless you're a light sleeper you should be okay.
We have had an incredible trip! The whole building was super clean, comfortable, stylish, and safe. Shantell Preusser was always super quick to respond to any questions we had and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants.
Same was true for the day of my check-out - Mike kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. If it's available during your stay, book it.
He also showed us their beautiful backyard which was lush and refreshing, and was able to take Instagram worthy pictures in the garden and pond. We highly recommend Ben and Mike’s home. Thank you so much for hosting us!Hope we cross paths again!
We loved the modern design and really cool efficient use of space and the tranquil garden setting. I just wish we were there when it was warmer and sunny so we could sit in the garden outside. Colin was super quick in his communication and was there to greet us when we arrived.
BEST Airbnb and host EVER!!! Tiana is extremely friendly and super hospitable. I would give her 10 STARS if I could :) you MUST stay at this adorable cottage.
Chuck's sense of humor is delightful and we truly loved our chats with him throughout our stay. Thank you, Chuck, for a celebratory weekend my family and I will always remember! Cheers, Charlotte
The apartment was in a safe area (our number one priority). It was BEAUTIFUL and the bed was the MOST comfortable we have ever slept on. It was centrally located next to cvs, a food store, etc... walking distance.
Staying at Christian and Jackie's was absolute perfect. The house is lovely, clean and spacious and there is even a back yard where you can sit and have a nice breakfast in the morning. The hosts are friendly and helpful.
Clean, nicely decorated inside . A newer wood deck that wraps around the front. A view of the sound.
Lovely stay at Elizabeth’s house in Redondo! She’s was so accommodating with my late arrival. Easy to park, clean, large and comfortable room and the perfect location block from the beach (perfect for my morning run).
The location of apartment close to subway and bus stop, shops, restraurants and cafes. Also I have to acknowledge the communication prior arrival was really quick and clear. Thank you Shantell Preusser and John Brashier for having us.
Parking was no issue. Kim & Taj were quick in responding when I booked this space months prior and very thorough in check in/out instructions several days before arriving. Would stay here again in a heartbeat and wish I could call that little space home!
You will not be sorry. But the thing that puts her place over the top is her attention to detail. Hardboiled eggs, yogurt and OJ in the fridge.
The locations is within minutes of walking from fantastic restaurant . The house of stocked with snacks, drinks, and even ramen! The washer and dryer was super helpful given we stayed for a week.
Neva went above and beyond providing comforts , the bungalow was extremely comfortable and clean, and I would absolutely stay again! Plus, her two dogs are super cute! The shower is really awesome- so that was a plus!
Tyler's home was great! It was exactly how it was described. His home was very comfortable, easy to check-in, a great location, and parking was a breeze.
I can’t wait until my next Oakland visit and the chance to stay at the casita! My husband and I enjoyed every minute we spent in Melia's lovely casita! This was our second trip to visit our son who now lives and works in San Francisco.
Oh my goodness, I wanted to stay forever!! It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. Jesus was incredibly accommodating when I asked if I could arrive early and very quick to respond to messages.
They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. The Suite has everything I could need and more, thanks to Susan. Thoughtful touches, like a "welcome back" bottle of wine and fresh flowers, a fresh-fruit basket, breakfast items in the refrigerator, fresh pastries - the list goes on.
The location is minutes from the expressway , UPS, old town Tacoma and Ruston Way. The cottage was without a doubt one of our favorite AirBNB stays! the property is beautiful, and Michelle's garden and neighborhood were spectacular.
Along with fresh flowers, she left a basket of snacks (breakfast bars, cereal, oatmeal, chips and cookies), and a special dark chocolate orange treat. Christiana checked in with me just to make sure I had everything I needed. Great experience.
Stayed at this place to surprise my boyfriend for our anniversary and he was blown away by how gorgeous and broad the loft was! Gloria is also a very friendly and helpful host who communicates and responds quickly. It definitely felt like a home away from home!
I've found my second home! In fact, one can virtually arrive with their clothing and will find all they need in full stock at the cottage. I plan to stay again and again.
Giant room finished with antic materials. This room is probably the best place we have stayed in an Airbnb so far! large room with a king bed, master bath.
They are excellent hosts who are kind, considerate, and thoughtful. They provide a coffee maker in the room, and breakfast items in the kitchen each morning, which is such a great help. Matthew An puts flowers from their garden in your room, which is a lovely and thoughtful touch.
Christiana checked in with me just to make sure I had everything I needed. Definitely a little gem in Tacoma.
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. Beautiful place and a wonderful host! Thank you for a great first experience.
It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.) If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment.
Coming and going was very easy. The front door offered a key pad and there was also one on our bedroom door for added security. There is a shared kitchen and living room area.
The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber.
The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. If you want to have a a good time in Chicago, don't stay at Danielle's place..... If you want to have A FABULOUS TIME IN CHICAGO, STAY HERE!
Street parking was easy over the weekend and it's only a 5 minute walk from the BART. The cottage itself was clean, light (with tons of windows) and a lovely design. We felt like we had our own tiny house for the weekend!
! Heather's home is in a supreme location if you're looking for a section of San Francisco that is wonderfully calmer and more tender than the others while still providing lots to do and see (doesn't hurt to also be in an area where parking is easy to find!). Her shared home is beautifully decorated and we enjoyed looking through the big binder of things to check out— even me as someone who's spent seven years in the past living in this gem of a city.
From the apt I walked all the way home from UCal Berkeley and the Botanical Garden, which is probably only for people who love to walk as I do. I also walked easily over to Cesar Chavez Park and the Marina. Otherwise, you can take Uber or Lyft or public transport via 511.org to get where you want to be, or walk a block and a half to the cute shop and restaurants along 4th Avenue.
The space is exactly as described. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh.
Can walk around late at night without problem. Bathroom was amazing clean with all shower products provided. Big super plus bonus if your a dog lover .
Neva was a great host! Very responsive. The space was cute, clean, and had good amenities.
This is a must see and must stay home if you’re in the Tacoma area! Thank you Lindsay Brown and Julie for being such amazing host ! :)
Joshua’s place is spacious and welcoming with a large bedroom, washroom and living space. We appreciated our host’s friendliness and he has an adorable puppy who is friendly and sweet  (the puppy is active at times so sometimes we could hear her playing about upstairs!). Joshua shared his tips with us and we loved his recommendation to try out “Betty Maust ground”, a lovely restaurant across the street.
My favorite part was the way she had stocked the bathroom with all these adorable little toiletries. Angela’s place was wonderful. A little smaller than we expected but all worked out great.
You will be spoiled here. Even as someone with no background in interior design, it was obvious that each furniture and item was placed with purpose in mind: contrary to the actual physical size, the rooms felt spacious, and things were easily findable and accessible. The location allowed us to easily reach Manhattan by subway.
I phoned my family every other day. Couldn't ask for more. This was our honeymoon and our first airbnb experience and it was a very good one.
Jo made every accommodation we had asked for and then some. Jo showed us all the best spots including running along the waterfront and through beautiful and safe area of the city. She gave us all the good tips of the local bar, Vietnamese restaurant and coffee shops.
Paul was an amazing host, responsive and super communicative. I definitely will try to book again when I visit again!
So close to everything. Neva's place was great, everything that I needed and super good location within walking distance to the beach, restaurants and a supermarket. Only met Neva briefly but she was so nice and I would have enjoyed to spend a bit more time more her for sure if she wasn't heading to Arnold Jackson for a ski :)
Would definitely stay here again if I’m in the area. Heather’s space is beautiful. Super comfortable bed.
We were “cool” from there. There is construction so you have to careful when walking. There is a local transportation system that will take you to the local bars and back to the cottage.
We did not have our own vehicle. If you are not used to driving in hill , be advised that this area is quite hilly and the roads are narrow - so do take your time getting in and out of the neighborhood.
This was my first stay in an Airbnb and I was very satisfied. There were extra blankets, which was fantastic. The place was comfy and well styled with awesome books on San Francisco.
I booked it right away without any issues. It can perfectly fit up to 3 people. It also has one of coolest showers I’ve ever seen In a home.
Heather's place has been by far the best Air BnB experience to date! Her apartment was beautifully kept and furnished and located in a great part of town - just slightly away from the hustle & bustle but a quick muni ride into all the action which made it a perfect home base for exploring the city. The apartment itself, check-in process and amenities provided by Heather were all amazing and definitely above and beyond what I would normally expect.
And you could not ask for a better host! Clean, well maintained, and very comfortable place to stay (with dedicated parking!). Conveniently located  in the heart of a friendly oceanside community walkable access to some of the more peaceful, not-too-crowded beaches in Los Angeles.
It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. Very, very comfy couch and bed. The wine and snacks were a lovely touch.
Jodi Stallings place is like everything you want from a boutique hotel with none of the bother of dealing with other guests or the awkward encounters that sometimes come with them. It offers a beautiful queen-sized room with a street view, a spa-like bathroom (super fluffy towels, lavender shower products..), and a small station with a microwave, coffee machine,  kettle, and plates for all your lite bite need . It also has good and easy to control heat, which was a welcome respite from the cold rainy weather during my stay.
The location was perfect, easy walk to the beach and pier. Paul was so kind & welcoming, as well as knowledgeable about the area. I will definitely be staying there again next time I visit, hopefully very soon!
We enjoyed our stay w Cher Alexander and Laurie. The location was perfect—just stairs away from the Fourth Ave Strip. The evening we arrived Laurie drove us on a brief tour of the area to point where (and where not) to eat.
Angela’s place is perfect for a solo traveler or a couple. The only thing is there are no windows so it can get quite dark. I love fresh air so in order to air out the studio I had to leave the door open a little.
We felt incredibly safe and welcomed in Min’s home. He is fast to respond and assist with any questions you might have. I can not recommend this place enough!!
She even had beach towels, beach umbrella and anything else you may need for a trip to the beach. She was easy to get ahold of and gave us lots of recommendations for all kinds of things to do/eat. The space is small but fairly spacious for 2 people with a nice sized bathroom and small kitchen.
Dan and Traci's place was a wonderful place to stay while visiting Berkeley. The room is cozy and gorgeous. It is snug for two, but we were comfortable; all the built ins and storage nooks and charging corners made it a pleasure, and the view is unparalleled.
Thank you Ewa! Ewa and her place are both wonderful! Ewa met us outside when we arrived to show us where to park and gave us a short tour of the rooms.
I had a lovely stay at the Garden Hideaway. Mishaa & Denise are excellent hosts. It's exactly as described - a standalone cottage/room in the garden, separated from the main house.
Great hostess and cute bungalow. Space is small but set up well. Outside space is private and very comfortable for reading or just enjoying the outdoors.
My boyfriend and I needed a “down/relaxing” weekend. We really enjoyed: Chapel pizza, Rockafellas, the Waterfront, Repeal Bourbon and Burgers, Jeremy Johnson’s, Bad Ass Coffee nd the Shack on 8th! We also did a dolphin cruise through Ruddees.
Sheri Vowell is friendly and prompt. I loved having a small balcony for outdoor space, the bed and linen and bath were scrumptious and I wish I have more time both visiting with her and staying in her lovely home.
Scott, Thank you for your hospitality, we very much enjoyed our stay at your place, we would highly recommend your space and look forward to our next Visit. We especially enjoyed the close proximity to shops, the beach and use of your Beach Cruisers !!! Felipe & Russ
I loved the photos to describe how to find the entrance to the unit. Pam and Richard are wonderful hosts. We arrived a bit earlier than we expected, and they graciously welcomed us and allowed us to settle in.
Beautiful room, sparkling clean and large shower with immediate hot water, comfortable bed with high-quality linens, public transportation easily available, close to several coffee shops and yummy bakeries, easy walk to Golden Gate Park, close to Safeway, and immediate response from Chris to any request. No noise; felt very secluded even though the place was right in the middle of everything. The breakfast items that were available to us, plus the bottled water, were very much appreciated.
Our stay at Gregory Simons place was amazing. I've been to many AirBNB's and with many Superhosts, but the attention to detail and the thoughtful touches that she had were outstanding. As a guest, you get the feeling that she really cares about your stay and wants you to be as comfortable and happy as possible.
I was able to easily Lyft to my favorite go-to spots in SF. The decor and amenities of the bedroom were awesome. I enjoyed using the AppleTV and playing music while I got ready to go out.
The topographic point itself was fantastic as well. With the ocean just a few blocks away, this place is an ideal location. You get the fresh ocean air but you're just removed enough from the traffic of PCH  to enjoy a peaceful and quiet night's sleep and still within walking distance of the Redondo Beach Pier, among many other places to see.
A lovely part of Berkeley, with beautiful gardens all around and the street is incredibly quiet so you can get a good night's rest. Justin is really friendly and accommodating too. The icing on the cake for us was that the apartment looks out onto a green area that made it very light and private - and we saw a deer right outside the door!
Then the next day we went to downtown Berkeley, to the Bennie Dudgeon's Market and to the Berkeley campus. Then to San Francisco where we had lunch in China town and watched the Women's March on Market Street which was HUGE! The second evening we walked to dinner at a restaurant just a few block from the cottage.
We would definitely stay here again! If you are looking for a homely, tranquil place by the beach away from the hustle & bustle of the city this is the perfect topographic point . The apartment is spotlessly clean, homely and has everything you need to relax and enjoy your break.
We will def choose this place again if we visit SF. This was an extremely nice place, located in a really fabulous neighbourhood with plenty of parks and restaurants to explore. The room was spacious, very open and clean and perfect for two people.
Such as breakfast options, cooking supply , and a french press for coffee lovers! After long days out in the city we enjoyed being able to cuddle up on the couch and stream some movies. We  really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it for anyone looking to explore the beauty in and around San Francisco!
The owners have lovingly seen to every detail of the place, from providing coffee and tea (and a jar of jelly beans!) to feather pillows and even a "white noise" devise for sleeping. The garden area, too, is lovely.
Danielle’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. There were four of us, so we did two in each bed — totally comfortable. As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm.
This is the gold standard of any place we stayed! Elizabeth provided excellent communication and high end bedding and mattress. Best sleep I've had!
The neighbourhood is quiet, the apartment immaculate, and the bed was Very Comfortable (so much so that we had a full night's sleep, even with jet lag!!) We enjoyed our stay, though it might be a little pricey for the space; it is essentially a well appointed basement apartment where no cooking is allowed. (this is where the four stars kicked in) There were plenty of delightful treats however, and a microwave is in the kitchen for warming up take-away food.
On our first morning we did not have any dollars yet, so they lent us some money to get on a bus to the city. The room is perfect, really private with a great bathroom  completely for you. It’s clean and the bed is really good.
Ernie and Lenora were amazing hosts and their hospitality is off the charts. The check-in process was seamless. The entire house was clean, cozy and QUIET and all the amenities you could possibly think of were on offer: coffee/tea maker, bottled water, soap, shampoo, towels, iron, ironing board, fans etc........
You must go steep stairs but that's all right . Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. The hosts thought of everything and really added the perfect touches to make this place feel like a home away from home. We stayed for five days and were very comfortable.
She allowed us to keep our luggage in the space until we headed to the airport and indicated that if she ended up needing the place earlier, she’d store it at her home for us. It was spotless, cozy, and beautiful. The next time I stay in Tacoma, I will definitely be staying there.
All of our guests commented on this unique and stunning property which allowed both intimacy and plenty of space to spread out. The furnishings, artwork, and decor add to the charm and whimsy of Wiseacre. Everywhere one turns there is something else to discover - many pieces provide a chuckle, as does Chuck himself (and his adorable Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Charlotte).
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. Lindsay Brown’s topographic point is conveniently located near the Land’s End Coastal Trail which for adventurous hikers will take you all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. The magnificent vistas you will see on your hike will make you forget you’re actually getting a great workout.
Easy to park, clean, large and comfortable room and the perfect location blocks from the beach (perfect for my morning run). It’s a very beautiful room! Much better than a hotel room.
It is as nice as it seems in the pictures. The cottage is well equipped and has also nice extras like beach cruisers, beach towels etc. Tiana was great and helpful host.
Arthur Paddick is great as well. She provided great instructions ahead of our check-in and communicated to us on our third day about potential Internet problems as she was having some service done. We didn't even have to ask if there was a problem - she was on top of it!
Wow- we have used Airbnb so many times but this was by far our best experience! The “ plus” exceeded our expectations. The little excess touches made all the difference and I am not sure I could ever go back to a standard.
Tip top of a spot. Can't say enough good things about Tammy...I'd let her baby sit the kid I don't have. There's a bike two boogie boards and a beach chair too.
Not sure what renting bikes elsewhere would have costed but the ease of use with these and being able to ride them everywhere back and forth made the trip that much better. Tons of activities and restaurants nearby, and just a few blocks away from the beach. Joan Litwin provides special touches that really made the experience for us.
She even had beach towels, beach umbrella and anything else you may need for a trip to the beach. She is absolutely a wonderful host and super welcoming. We highly recommend this lovely home.
Michael and Ben are great hosts - great response rate during check-in. This was our second visit to Ben and  Michael's place. We loved it last time and it was just as good this time.
The house is beautiful and the location is convenient to Manhattan and extremely convenient to JFK. Please be prepared to relax in this quiet, organized, efficient and peaceful home.
This was our first stay at an Airbnb, and we couldn't have been happier. The location of his apartment is fantastic. It's easy to get to and close to a lot of great restaurants.
Our stay at Susan's place was amazing. I've been to many AirBNB's and with many Superhosts, but the attention to detail and the thoughtful touches that she had were outstanding. As a guest, you get the feeling that she really cares about your stay and wants you to be as comfortable and happy as possible.
This is one of the best properties we've stayed in for a few reasons: great location, value, quality of space and amenities provided. We are a family of 4 and the guesthouse offers enough space to sleep us all with parking and a small outdoor space to enjoy the coastal breezes. Not only is the location fantastic (1 block to the beach) but it is so nice to enjoy a property that is completely ready to go!
Already planning our following trip to Tacoma! This little cottage is a great discovery , and Robert Huckabaa is an incredibly generous host. Cottage includes hair dryer, and pretty much anything you might forget to bring with you (extra toothbrush, toothpaste etc).
Lastly, Charlotte was a little love to have around! Thank you, Chuck and Charlotte, for providing your amazing home as a wedding venue. We hope to see you again soon!
Check in was very easy and Tiana allowed us to check in early. Finally throughout the stay she was always available with any question that came up. I would definitely stay at this topographic point again.
A cozy, clean and comfortable spot in the historic North End! The bed is super comfy and the sofa bed is also comfy! The space can fit up to 4 people!
Star and Austin provided so many nice touches, including bikes, a hammock, beach towels, premium TV (Netflix, Prime) - even aloe vera gel in the fridge for the inevitable. House is a five minute walk to beach but also situated in a quiet cul de sac, aside a pond. Coffee and filter water provided, but there's no kitchen, so plan to eat out or buy prepared foods.
The day of the trip, I realized that the cabin was only supposed to welcome 2 people so I told Lois Davis, and he was very nice at accommodating this last minute change. The place is so stylish, it has everything you need for an awesome time (coffee, teas, grill, salt, pepper, monopoly, Arthur Paddick....during the day we walked up the hill to a lighthouse, we grilled, and sat in the morning on the deck for a nice cup of tea. I will absolutely come back!
Not sure what renting bikes elsewhere would have costed but the ease of use with these and being able to ride them everywhere back and forth made the trip that much better. Tons of activities and restaurants nearby, and just a few blocks away from the beach. Christine provides special touches that really made the experience for us.
! Richard Batton was a  warm and very welcoming host, who offered many thoughtful touches to this apartment: food in the fridge, plenty of towels and blankets, and lots of suggestions for visiting Tacoma well presented in a booklet. The neighbourhood is quiet, the apartment immaculate, and the bed was Very Comfortable (so much so that we had a full night's sleep, even with jet lag!!)
The space was cozy and clean and Chip (and his sweet dog Olive) thought of everything! We found the inclusion of some fun games and activity to be very charming as well. We'd love to return to spend more time here!
The room was clean with plenty of towels. Francis Jones, beach chairs and towels were provided. All in all great stay and would definitely come back to Tammy in the future!
Chip communicated quickly and easily and made our stay in Vashon a stress free one. The house catered to a relaxing and freeing weekend. I highly recommend dipping your feet in the water it'll definitely wake you up.
BTW, although a lot of the restaurants were closed when we went out for dinner (Monday night), we fell in love with the patio area at Jupiter and their salads were amazing. Linda and Dan's cottage is the perfect place to relax after the hustle and bustle of a jam packed vacation. It was wonderful to have full privacy while maintaining precious views of the beauty of nature right outside the windows.
We will definitely be returning. Thank you
Neva's in-law unit was the perfect location for a little weekend pickup at the end of a week of conferences in LA. It's super close to both Redondo and Hermosa beach and it was easy to get to and from the board walks and restaurant . The unit is a perfect size for two people and came with all the amenities you'd need.
Her bungalow is simply charming and extremely clean with every amenity you could want. was a huge asset and the location is  superb. If you're heading to the Redondo area look no further as you've found the best spot in town!!
Even though our stay was short, my new wife and I were extremely satisfied and delighted with our stay at Zeena and Miranda Malone's home! However, one of our favorite parts of their home was their dog, Samantha, who was so cute and loving! We would recommend this to anybody looking for a comfortable and clean room, kind hosts, a great meal, and a very adorable dog!
This topographic point is PHENOMENAL!!! We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds. The comforts provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush?
The cottage is just lovely, the kind of place you want to wrap up at the end of the holiday and take back home with you! The residential area is also very pleasant. We were there during the Oakland marathon so the topographic point was busy and buzzing, which only added to the atmosphere.
I stay in a lot of Airbnbs, and many do not provide these items. The cottage is NOT a basement apartment, either which is great. Private parking spot right next to the cottage and it has its own little patio outside, plus it's spacious.
We really enjoyed our stay. The double sink were great. The walk in closet was amazing .
Every last touch one could think of was addressed. The house has a beautiful little backyard with comfy patio furniture and blankets provided. It's the perfect space to meditate.
We live in a very quiet vicinity in Phoenix so the noise out on the street, definitely caused us to not have as restful of a night’s sleep as we had hoped. Enjoy!!! Pamela Drew
Added bonus was the $12 uber (cheap!) My aunt and I had a really great time! Wish we could have explored the antique shop .
Lindsay Brown’s home is quaint, cozy, and equipped for even the coldest weekend in Chicago! We were greeted and welcomed by Lindsay Brown himself. He reviewed the check in procedures with us and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.
Trent was ecstatic that you had three different contraptions to brew coffee (he prefers the French press) and did a very childish happy dance when he saw you had fancy sugar cubes. A lot of Airbnbs provide coffee, but rarely do I see black tea! It was nice to enjoy the views of the Sound and admire the beech tree on your property to a nice cup of tea/coffee.
Cozy Room 3 is exactly that - small and cozy and thoughtfully arranged, sparkly clean, and comfortable. I had an early flight and only spent one night there (barely) and I wish I would have had more time there to enjoy the home and neighborhood. I did take a nice long walk in the neighborhood, which was lovely.
We definitely recommend staying with Lia and Pamela Drew in their sunny, cozy, clean apt. and benefit from their great personality and hospitality!
Scott responded very quickly to our questions and if we had any trouble accessing the house. Scott is a great host! His place is gorgeous & he includes MANY extras!
It was spotlessly clean, and there were fresh towels and bathmats placed out. The room is literally a five-minute walk from the Ashby Bart Station - from here I caught the Bart to Downtown Berkeley and San Francisco. There is also a lovely bar on the corner which had live music and poetry reading while I was there.
The whole place is a bright designer solution of usage space in a most  effective manner. We appreciated a prompt communication in cases we had questions. It was great that Maggie and John made it possible for us to keep our luggage in their storage room even after check-out die to our late flight.
Best of all was the attention to detail. We absolutely loved our stay at Sierra's little cozy apartment. It was decorated nicely and had everything we needed included a Lara bar that was needed for my post surgery wooziness.
The entrance and foyer are ground level with parking right in front. I was there during a heat wave and while there's no air conditioning, fans kept the rooms cool. I highly recommend this place.
Had the best time! Paul had amazing hospitality, explained a bunch of things to us upon arrival and was very good at communicating! A perfect place for a couple people for a getaway.
We had a great time at Tylers place. We loved everything; from the comfy bed to the amazing shower and the big television to watch movies late at night coming back from the city! Tyler is the best host we ever had, he helped us so good!
This is my second stay at Igor. The place is sparkling clean, quiet  neighborhood, and is definitely worth your stay if interested in that area .. he is definitely a super host .. expect to be back again
Amazing room and amenities! It feels better than most hotels. Comfortable bed, comfortable spaces, thoughtful touch with the snacks, list of places to eat and explore, and the towel warmer!
Tyler is a fantastic host! Needless to say when we come back to SF, we will stay here again! :)
Loved having Logan visit us in the court :) Neva was very lovely and accommodating. Beyond excellent experience!
Mishaa & Denise put fresh coffee, biscuits and water out for when I arrived, which made it feel very homely. I was the only person using it while I was there. It was spotlessly clean, and there were fresh towels and bathmats placed out.
I live in Tacoma and have traveled the world for 25+ years, and must say I plan to again drive the 3 miles from my home to Thomas George's studio, just to take a "stay-cation". Only thing that was unexpected is that the beds are water beds. First for me to sleep on one, and it was quite different.
We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. We highly recommend staying at T's beach cottage. We can't wait to come back again!
Chip came to welcome us when we arrived. I couldn't have asked for a better host. Chip communicated quickly and easily and made our stay in Vashon a stress free one.
Before I been there, the host sent me  a lot of notes to help me find this house. The host helped me and showed me how to operate the light . That’s an excellent experience.
Crystal Romero was very responsive and very quick to answer my questions. He helped us get parking, gave us a tour, and got us all settled. Perfect host.
The walk to the beach is short and lets out in kind of a private area since the access is through a regular neighborhood. Katherine's place is ideal for folks wanting a quiet, peaceful place that is close to the beach. It's definitely walkable (2 long blocks), but having a car was great and allowed me to check out the beautiful trails of First Landing State Park.
Our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to  Betty Maust's experienced guidance. He's a wealth of help at just the right moment! His home is airy and warm, an uncommon juxtaposition.
No detail, no matter how small, was overlooked! The bathroom featured a great shower with all the amenities (body wash, shampoo, conditioner) and good water pressure--because yes, we all know that matters! :) A double sink with counter space came in super handy as I was staying with a friend.
You will enjoy the atmosphere of the candles and lights. I cannot believe how special and wonderful Arthur Paddick space was! Truly the best airbnb I have ever stayed in.
The suite was very clean, they had thought of everyone a guest may need. When we checked in, Francis Jones greeted us and gave us an extensive orientation. It was great!
You are only a 5-7 min walk to the L.  Bus transport is easily accessible. As well, the neighborhood is very cool. It is close to many other fun areas of west Chicago.
I arrived rather late in the evening (around 9:30ish), and Matthew An came out to greet me and show me the place. Once inside the apartment, there are a set of doors that lead out to the garden which is also enclosed. The apartment was very spacious and tidy.
Nice host, thanks so much. I stayed at Deborah Hines place after getting in from a long flight, before driving home the next day. It is close to LAX and if looking for a great topographic point in LAs South Bay I would definitely recommend her home.
I can’t say enough good things here! This is my second time at Christiana’s place. The location can’t be beat.
Thank you so much for hosting us!Hope we cross paths again! Edward Ramsey and Ben are possibly the best hosts I've ever had at an airbnb. They are amazing.
The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level. We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the land floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private.
Also recommendations are printed out for you. And even has an Alexa for you! !
Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! Shantell Preusser and comfy! We loved our stay at Jeanna's, the place really felt like a home to us.
Would gladly stay again! Me and my boyfriend decided to visit Virginia Beach for few days in the peak season and Katherine’s place looked the best on this website according the monetary value and the handiness to the beach! When we arrived, it turned out to be so much better than we expected because we could just walk to the beach and to the local restaurants without using our car.
The guest room is set up with helpful guides about walking San Francisco or visiting the Golden Gate Bridge. I left her house each day and walked to all my destinations (although ambitious, it can totally be done from this location). She also had a helpful "where to eat" handout on the desk when I got there.
We love this topographic point because it is absolutely gorgeous and stylish. My wife and I just got married and spent a few days in Chicago and we were glad to stay here for our mini-moon. Communication was also great from the start and it was clean.
Elizabeth’s place is everything you want in a stay away from home. The drinking water and fresh flowers were a nice, thoughtful touch. Elizabeth was very accommodating and friendly.
In my three years of experience with Airbnb, staying at Edward Ramsey’s place is bar none the best experience I’ve ever had with an Airbnb listing. Edward Ramsey and her cozy oasis truly surpassed all of my expectations. After sharing with her the reason for my stay, she completely went out of her way to think of every detail and amenity that I needed to feel comforted and at home.
Jo was a fabulous host. The room and bath were comfortable and tastefully decorated. She even baked granola in the morning for our breakfast!.
We visited San Francisco on our honeymoon and weren't  sure what to expect since neither one of us had ever been to the west coast. Our host for the week definitely helped us to feel right at home in an unfamiliar place. Mishaa was so kind and hospitable.
And sparkling clean is not an adequate word to describe the bedroom and bathroom. I will keep using Airbnb when travel but I think Dorothy Moser's five+ star cordial reception has set an extremely high barroom for my future stay :)
He kindly offered for us to use his washer/dryer in unit, hold our bags after checkout until we headed out of the city, and of course gave us many recommendations and fun Chicago facts. We can’t wait to return.
Brent and Barry introduced themselves to us on our 2nd day due to our late check-in, they were both so very friendly, they made us feel right at home. They both were super quick to reply to any questions or requests that we made,  our whole experience was AWESOME! We sure hope to come back next year and stay again!
It is restful, quiet, and so comfortable. The hosts are fabulous in terms of thinking about every single thing that a guest could want. They communicate right away and are very helpful.
Michael made sure we had everything we needed while we were there and we loved chatting with him! We were literally headed to the airport talking about when we were going to come back. Thank you again Michael!
It is ideal for the single traveler and couples. I would love to stay in their beautiful suite again on my next visit to San Francisco.
We would highly recommend staying here and definitely wouldn't hesitant to stay here again! Rayford Kelly's house is fantastic. Definitely one of the greatest AirBnBs out there.
They also have the coolest book where you can take a photo of yourself and write about your travels - so it was really neat to look through it and see all of the people who had stayed with them before us. Laura and Ralph are the most gracious of hosts. Upon our arrival they greeted us with bright smiles and delicious home baked banana bread.
The space itself is warm and inviting with an excellent back porch. There’s great coffee and snacks provided as well. We loved our stay!
The place is conveniently located and the bikes she provides are a great way to get around town. Within walking distance of restaurants, grocery stores, cocktail lounges, beach, everything. A must stay.
Talk about finding a great house for a family gathering! Our daughter and her boyfriend came up from LA to join us. This house is away from the hustle/bustle of the Seattle area, yet convenient to Seatac airport and both cities.
Nala's place is absolutely perfect. We felt like one of the locals in this studio apartment, and we both already decided we're keeping this in mind for our next trip! Some great points: - Decor is adorable.
When we woke up the view was amazing! It was lovely. The Neighborhood felt very safe and quiet.
He’s led an interesting life and the chance to chat was a real treat, and probably our favorite part of the stay! The apartment is lush and artsy; it’s got a real lived-in, make yourself at home feeling. We felt welcome right away, and it really did seem like a home away from home!
The next time I’m visiting LA, I’ll be looking to see if Paul’s place is available. Thanks for everything, Paul!
This is the best Airbnb place we have stayed at and we’ve stayed at a few. It was really near to local shops and restaurants and a beautiful park. Parking was never a problem.
Elizabeth’s place is everything you want in a stay away from home. The location is excellent for visiting Redondo Beach Pier, and many nearby amenities. The value is great for being so close to the beach.
Heather’s place was fantastic. The place itself is sparkling clean, has beautiful garden, comfy bed and any facilities you may need during your stay (including the use of a washer & dryer). The book with very personal SFO advise is very useful and the spots recommended were fabulous!
The location is about a half hour from the beach and located in a quaint neighborhood. I wish we came during a warmer season so we could use the pool and hot tub. The guest house was neat and homey, decorated very cute.
Would definitely recommend for a relaxing beach getaway. This is my second stay here. Me and My Husband stayed for our Anniversary and had a peaceful relaxing time.
This is a great place that puts you in walking distance to Redondo Beach. As someone visiting LA for a couple days, I wanted to be close to the beach and this place definitely had it. In fact, not only could I walk to the beach, but there is a cool outdoor courtyard that you share with Neva that is super cute.
Noe Valley is the best area when you dont want the hustle and bustle from Fishermens Warff. They have good tip for the area too. Nice and comfortable bed!
Funky artwork throughout, which we appreciated. Could Uber anywhere in the city for less than $10 if willing to share a ride (but not during rush hour). Highly recommend, as long as you are able to negotiate a long flight of stairs.
This is a lovely apartment and Miranda Malone and Laurie are very accommodating hosts. It is convenient to a BART stop - either a walk or short Uber ride - that makes it easy to travel to business district or the Airport. I would heartily recommend staying here.
This was a quick weekend stop after I got engaged. The first night was pretty hot and Tim put a dehumidifier in the cottage. When that was not sufficient, the next morning he put in the AC.
The love of my life and  sweetheart Was so happy to stay there. This has created the most fantastic experience and weekend. Tiana and her husband invited us to use the bikes to go riding.
there's the cutest private garden right outside the backdoor, perfect for lounging in the morning with a cup of tea or at night near the outdoor fire pit with a glass of wine. the place was quiet at night and has a super comfy bed. we didn't cook much in the space, but the kitchen was stocked with all the basics, including a coffee machine.
We had a wonderful stay. The outdoor shower though was great, and refreshing, and a very unique enjoyable experience. Overall it is such a great space, location, amenities as advertised, and Amy and Dennis were so responsive, welcoming, and we loved meeting their dog too!
Sheri Vowell does so many lovely things for her guests. All the things you want - good communication, easy check in and out, convenient parking, a beautiful and comfortable space to call "home" for awhile. But to all this she adds plush robes and slippers, loads of downy towel , television and streaming channel option , and shelves of books if you'd like to explore something you haven't before.
There are quite few restaurants within biking/ walking distance as well that were recommended by Star and Austin. We saw them once or twice as we were coming and going from the home. They were extremely hospitable and I greatly appreciated that they checked on us via message after the first night to see if we needed anything (which we didn't!
The hosts are amazing and provide everything needed, including bikes, boogie boards, beach chairs and towels. Highly recommended !! A+++
Thoughtful touches included a nicely designed welcome magazine orienting you to the house, facilities and neighbourhood, providing snacks, drinks, ear plugs, white noise speaker and Apple TV. He even replaced the beer in the fridge with Prosecco and Bennie Dudgeon after realising that we were drinking wine. The neighbourhood seems relatively safe and the cafe nearby is a great place to grab a meal and just chill.
Jeni’s place was the perfect home for our stay in Tacoma. Walking distance to some fun breweries & restaurants, but also a quick car ride, Uber, or scooter ride from others. Jeni was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area.
He liked to be out with the flowers on the rooftop. This location is a prime spot for everything you need. We walked everywhere and parked our car in the sterling garage a block behind our building.
As soon as you walk in, you'll see how spacious the room is and how tall the ceilings are. The porch is a lovely spot to gaze at the side of the hill. Also, the bathroom is probably the nicest part of the place.
We used them every day and biked up to Manhattan Beach. If you're on the fence, just book it :)   Thank you for everything Francis Jones!
Very comfy bed, great shower and close to the beach areas. Great value,  communication and check in was seamless. Would definitely stay at the cozy Petite Boutique again.
Chuck is a fantastic host, with a gorgeous home rich in history; we couldn’t have been happier. I had a little trepidation at first, I am not someone who knows Tacoma well and the direction I came from was not great. I pulled up to the cabin and saw a charming well-taken care of abode, with a grill out front and little hearts carved into the wood panels for the railing.
Zeena is very knowledgeable about  local activities and has great suggestions if you want to do some site seeing. The room is well appointed and spacious, with lots of spare clean towels. When I stay with Zeena, I am in the lap of luxury!
They also allowed us to stay late on our last day due to our flight. Edward Ramsey and Debra Dibble’s place is perfect. The location can’t be beat (especially for the price.)
The private parking lot in the back was a major plus and the area was very safe and trendy with tons of shops and restaurants up Milwuakee Ave. Ewa provided many different amenities when we checked in and lots of useful local tips. Overall great experience and would definitely come back again!! Thank you Ewa!
We loved this location and appreciated the quiet neighborhood with the conveniency of being minutes from the airport. But the bed, after traveling all over Washington and B.C. was amazingly comfortable!
Apartment is beautifully decorated and such a beautiful patio. As a runner I enjoyed having the running/walking path that runs parallel to the ocean. And I would recommend the Java Beach Cafe for breakfast.
We were visiting for our 10th wedding anniversary and she made our stay excess special with many thoughtful touches. The place is cozy, comfortable, stylish and there are so many small details that make it feel just like home. Location is excellent with many amenities within walking distance.
It is also a walkable distance from many amazing restaurants, which is very convenient. Walking around (or even running on the beach, if you’re into that) provides a great opportunity to take advantage of the great weather and the vibe of this beach town! The neighborhood is beautiful and very quiet.
Crystal Romero's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit eccentric, quiet, & " comfortable ". I'm a 60's guy, and this suited me to perfection. I almost passed up on using my reservation because I was ahead of schedule and could have made home that night, but I'm so glad I didn't; it is such a serene place to spend some time.
He also directed up to a website that gave us a parking garage just three minutes' walk away that was only $20 for 24 hours. Fantastic place with many beautiful and funny details. There is loads of artwork and antiques.
The check-in process was easy. The parking is at the back and there is a narrow pathway next to the house where you can walk from  the parking lot to the front door. This can be a bit inconvenient if you are carrying many luggage.
Marc gave us great tips for where to go and what to do in and around Hermosa and Manhattan Beach, and was very responsive if we had any questions. I would recommend this topographic point to anyone looking to stay in area.
Her TV was connected to netflix so it was nice to relax before bed while watching our favorite shows. She also has plates, cups, coffee, and oatmeal available. Although we didn't use any of it, we thought it was a nice touch.
drive down Bridgeport to Ruston (depending on the time of day)  and you are at the Vashon ferry. I had to cancel my stay at Jo’s place because of the weather. But Airbnb is still asking me to write a review and so I’m going to review based on my communication with Jo even though I didn’t get to actually stay.
You want to stay here!!! Deborah Hines place was so perfect for two couples. Although their place is only listed as a private room you have so much space and privacy that you’d feel like you have an entire place.
You can tell they love their home and we felt lucky to be able to stay there. It's very special. There is also a cute little garden where you can relax with a glass of wine (and still get wifi if you need it).
There are bicycles, a beach wagon, beach chairs, beach umbrellas in the shed outside. Sparking clean, bright and fresh. The cottage is well appointed and efficient.
Room was clean, broad , and they do complementary linen change and room cleaning at the end of each week. I especially loved how I got my own guest parking spot, private entrance, and private bathroom. It was like my own apartment, and I got a lot of privacy overall.
Jo how does get on our way when it was time to go I was able to make suggestion . Jo is a gracious, friendly lady who has traveled extensively and her home shows this. Her art collection is fabulous!
We have stayed at numerous places in the Hermosa Beach/Redondo Beach area and this is bar none the best place to stay. Tiana’s beach cottage is a wonderful place to stay in Redondo beach. Not far from the beach and well located for any of the beach attractions.
Very friendly folks. UW TACOMA & the museums are about a 20 min walk away. We intended to hang out at the new McMenamins but spent most of our time at Denise's suggestions Red Star Tacos  & The Devil's Reef (a hopping tiki bar with BIG + unique drinks).
We had an easy time street parking our car directly outside the unit which was extremely convenient and one less thing to have to worry about. We also appreciated the easy self check-in/out process. The location was convenient to exploring some really cool shop , bars, and restaurant nearby.
I especially enjoy riding bikes and loved the trail! We expect to stay there again on our following visit.
What can I say? Marcos Blount place was just what I needed! I loved the sheets and the big bed was super cozy and comfy!
Apartment is cozy and comfortable for two people. Overall we had enjoyed our stay! Thank you Angela for your hospitality:)
Great place to stay. The place was clean and spotless. Very spacious.
Bennie Dudgeon was a great host! When we almost missed our connector flight she was willing to accommodate early morning arrival. Luck allowed us to catch our flight and she was still available to check us in later than expected!
The loft is very stylish, very clean, and comfortable with great comforts [e.g., internet, washer/dryer, French press and coffee, snacks, eggs, etc.]. Perfect launching pad for exploring the best Tacoma has to offer.
The neighborhood was quiet except for the occasional neigborhood children laughing and somobody playing saxaphone in the evening! (loved both). Linda recommended a groovy grocery store called Stadium Thriftway, that was just a short drive from the home.
Her communication is so friendly and helpful that she really made our stay even more memorable. It's a pretty special place...Jump on it if it's available!
The neighborhood is buzzing. The loft is very close to business district and major sights with easy acces to public transportation. There are many delightful restaurants around the corner.
The patio was peaceful to unwind and giant closet space was helpful to keep stuff out of the way. Neva’s Petite Boutique was exactly as stated in her description. I liked the convenience of being a 2 min walk to Carl’s Jr., Jersey Mike’s, and Rite Aid.
Wow! Jeff & Mike are excellent hosts. They welcomed us and gave us plenty of information about the city.
Some reviewers and Deborah Hines himself mentioned that he and his family live above the apartment but we barely heard them to be honest. Excellent value for money!
Loved our stay. We literally wouldn't change a thing: comfy bed, Roku TV with Netflix, lots of closet space, clean, plenty of sunlight, good WiFi, private entrance, parking and the beach practically in your backyard! Paul was quick to respond and very friendly.
Paul was so kind & welcoming, as well as knowledgeable about the area. Thanks so much Paul! Your place offered all the charm of beach city if LA that I grew up loving, with the perfect feel of a vacation atmosphere.
Neva's place if great. Heaven. Thanks Neva!
Overall, this place felt like home and was very cozy. Our family of 6 greatly enjoyed our stay at John Mullins's place. If I could give it 10 stars I would.
Maggie's place was awesome,  great touches, place was clean and had everything you need to make your stay a comfortable one,  would definitely recommend her place, and would stay with her again. Would definitely stay again!
Edwin Green was up in the morning with coffee which my husband enjoyed. There was a private bathroom for guest with toiletries. Check in was easy.
I have been to many airb bnbs across the world, and this is the one I have felt most welcomed at. We had a marvelous stay at Marcia's place. Not only was the space adorable and the views fantastic, but Marcia was truly a host who went above and beyond to make our stay spectacular.
The bed was comfortable and easy to nest in the fluffy pillows and duvets. The setting was lovely in her amazing garden which you are able to enjoy even if only on your way to and from the outdoor bathroom--which may have been my favorite part! There's something so satisfying about simply existing and appreciating what you have that added the magic ingredient to this stay.
Chuck and Charlotte (the sweetest pup) were the best hosts. Chuck was very attentive and responsive to all of our questions, and also provided helpful tips to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable. The house was sparkling clean, the bedrooms were comfortable and well appointed,  and the amenities were plentiful.
We loved everything about this ( web site hidden by Airbnb) close to beach, beautiful, clean n fresh and just perfect. We actually hate leaving. Tiana is a super host for a reason she is 100% SUPER.
It was close to all of the delicious food and shops on 4th St, fairly close to campus but was nestled in a beautiful neighborhood with ample parking. I would definitely stay there again if I was ever in town.
You would not be disappointed if you stayed here. Amazing experience all around! !
My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Tim and Chris were SO helpful with offering suggestion on what we could do and see while we were in town. We just had to walk across the street. There are endless amounts of things to do and see within close proximity of the cottage.
Everything we needed was there from hanger to coffee to Qtips (an added bonus!) I highly recommend this bungalow to anyone visiting Redondo Beach!
Neva is warm and welcoming, and meeting her sweet pup, Arnold Jackson was an extra special dainty ! Loved it!
There is an keyless entry to the apartment. There is a beautiful patio , private and confortable. We had all we needed for our weekend.
These include the signage throughout the place, the ability to have a place for dirty towels, the quality sheets, the fabulous decor, shampoo and soap for showers, the walking distance location, secure access to the building, ability to lock the room, news quietly on in the morning in the main area, cool multi-plug device next to bed for cell phones and more, continental breakfast, and I could go... Jimmy was fantastic from start-to-finish—a host who obviously understands his business—and the room was exactly as promised. I wasn't there long, so I can't speak to much in the way of amenities, but that's actually what was cool for me.
You won’t regret it. !
We had such an amazing time riding the motorcycle she had available for us on the beach! It is the perfect getaway location!
Neva was out of town and asked someone else to look after the house. Nova helped me meet my personal needs. The location is very convenient, only 10 minutes walking distance to Hermosa beach and close to restaurant and market.
There are just no words to describe this place. Chuck was the most gracious, funny, warming, magical host. My boyfriend and I laughed, cried(happy tears), relaxed, and stood still.
We had a lovely stay here and would come back in a heartbeat! Scott was so welcoming and responsive, and very thoughtful about making sure that we had everything we needed. The coach house is bright and spacious, tidy, and had plenty of amenities -- from toiletries to an iron to fresh eggs in the fridge.
Elizabeth's place is very nice and cozy. We could access the room simply. I have to mention the good quality of the bed;)!
It's an enjoyable experience staying at Mishaa's place. We stayed 8 nights there and were very satisfied with the place. The room is at the back of the house and it stands alone in the garden.
The neighbourhood seems relatively safe and the cafe nearby is a great place to grab a meal and just chill. Do head over to the nearby Bernal Heights Park, hike up to the top for amazing 360 view of San Francisco and a cute swing on a tree! Finally, Tyler was a great host who responded promptly to messages and was very accommodating.
He reviewed the check in procedures with us and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. You can expect a clean home with plenty of sleeping space, additional blankets, and towels. As a guest you have your own entrance, control of the thermostat, and a ton of storage.
And sparkling clean is not an enough word to describe the bedroom and bathroom. Zeena even provides the earplugs and eye pads for light sleepers. Thank you Airbnb for introducing this wonderful experience into my life and I'm becoming a big fan and advocate of Airbnb because of this stay.
It's well decorated and stylish. One more thing, the room has an Amazon echo point called Alexa and I like it so much! I'm gonna buy one for myself.
I had no trouble getting in each time.. the women at the front desk were all friendly (I made a point of saying hello to each of them so they were greeting me like old friends after 2 days). I highly recommend Rod and his lovely apt.
! A great place with thoughtful touched and decor! We loved the place and the location was perfect....truly one block from the beach!
The house is literally across the street from a market and Starbucks and right next to a parking lot, so we did not have maneuver San Francisco’s crazy parking zones. We came from Napa and arrived three hours before our check-in time, but Arnold Jackson allowed us to drop off our (ridiculously huge) bags and even brought them upstairs and had them waiting on our room at 3pm! The room was just as pictured; it has huge ceiling , beautiful finishes and the en-suite bathroom is stunning with the best lighting and full-length mirror.
The vicinity is super cute and most important, very safe. The Host Heather is so nice and her hospitality was AMAZING! The Cottage is located in front of Heather’s home so she is there if you need her for anything.
It was our first experience staying at an Airbnb and it did not disappoint. We had no hassle and it was like home away from home. Tyler has the place kitted out wit everything u cud possible need.
Luke was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. Overall a great airbnb, as described, and would stay there again! Thanks luke!
Big room with a king bed, master bath. It is walking distance from the beach, restaurants, Whole Foods and good coffee. Erik Dickson is an attentive and kind host!
I love this place. It is super close to everything (beach, restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, library, post office, LAX). Tiana is super helpful with restarant suggestions, etc., and she is very quick to respond.
There were also bikes, beach items, towels and other things available to visit the beach and explore. Overall, my family of four (myself, my wife and two kids ages 8 and 12) had a great stay and would definitely return in the future. We highly recommend Paul’s place.
She was a great and responsive host. This is a GREAT AirBnb if your coming into the the San Fran area!! Chris has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and relaxing!
We really enjoyed our stay. The double sinks were great. The walk in closet was awesome.
It was BEAUTIFUL and the bed was the MOST comfortable we have ever slept on. I know this probably was Not their norm but it was a nice touch to leave it there. There isn’t a dishwasher and the microwave is on the bottom drawer but this didn’t bother us.
We plan to stay here again during our next trip to Tacoma!. Jo's place is centrally located in Tacoma. Close to everything!
Along with fresh flowers, she left a basket of snacks (breakfast bars, cereal, oatmeal, chips and cookies), and a special dark chocolate orange treat. The space is bright, warm and comfortable. The location can’t be beat (coffee shop , restaurants and grocery stores nearby), with a great position of Commencement Bay.
Dan and Linda’s small, secluded cottage was exactly what we needed to escape to at the end of a long, crazy wedding day! We loved the little bouquet beside the bed that matched our wedding florals - a lovely and thoughtful touch! Their hospitality really went above and beyond what was required or expected, and we felt like special guests in their beautiful home.
The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab.
and was constantly making sure that I had everything I needed. I'm so glad that I finally had a chance to meet her in person as she's absolutely lovely - thanks Erica for another wonderful trip and I'll see you next time!
The cottage is cute as a bug and oh-so-comfortable. I was overwhelmed with her quick responses and generosity in helping us on anything that we inquired about. What a treasure this was.
The shower is awesome. T was super quick to respond and knowing I would arrive late, she had lights on ready for me. Just what was needed after a long day of travel.
It is within easy reach of public transportation into the heart of the city, but it is far enough away from the city to offer a quiet respite from the hubbub of San Francisco. heather apartment was exactly as I expected it to be, it is exactly as pictured, clean and aired. The location was ideal for us, we didn’t want to stay downtown we wanted chilled and slow which is exactly what we got.
There are some nice amenities like an overhead projector, kitchen, games, drawing table, bar area. Access was easy and secure. Very clean.
The bungalow is NOT a basement apartment, either which is great. Really worth the stay.
Super welcoming and helpful hosts. Loved our stay!! !
Thomas George is absolutely wonderful and the house is gorgeous! The location is prime and walking distance to everything you could want, from parallel bars to beaches! Definitely cannot wait to return and stay here again!
I know that the  Quality  That I got can’t beat it in a hotel even a  Bennie Dudgeon. I will definitely come back and stay with you guys . I really loved everything, I can’t describe how grateful and greatf for you both.
George very nicely baked up some blueberry muffins, ahh they were amazing I wish we could have some more now  All in all it was one of our favorite Air B&B's visting America. We stayed far out from San Francisco City because the prices were so high, it depends on what you you want to do in the city. We don't regret booking our from the city.
Igor's house is immaculately clean and fresh. He does not allow outside shoes to be worn inside which I appreciate as it is a rule in my own home. The house is beautiful and the location is convenient to Manhattan and extremely convenient to JFK.
My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Tim and Chris were SO helpful with offering suggestions on what we could do and see while we were in town. We just had to walk across the street. There are endless amounts of things to do and see within close proximity of the cottage.
Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed comforts . Overall, would highly recommend! !
The space was decorated really nice, everything was very comfortable including the beds & lounge area plus there was thoughtful amenities like a mini fridge, coffee maker & washer/dryer for guests to use. I’d highly recommend their place if you’re in the area!
And little handwritten notes everywhere. I find their helpful notes, discover indulgent treats, and settle in to the comfort of this wonderful  BnB. "Above and beyond" expectations is clearly their motto.
The photos of this place do not do justice to how lovely, warm and full of thoughtful touches it is. And ofcourse, how can I not mention about the cutest, warmest cat I've ever met and that's Sir Dumpling! He is so adorable and I had a lovely time playing with him even though I am not an animal lover and a little paranoid around pets.
Angela was easily one of the best sweetest hosts i’ve stayed with! She was so thoughtful and made our stay so easy and comfortable. The place was also so beautiful and so homey.
And there were ample towels, toiletries, and plateware to be found. I literally rolled in with my suitcase and I was home. If I were to make any change, it would be the small addition of having more blankets or sympathizer available.
I could go on and on. I wish I could give more than five star . We would return to Tacoma just to stay at Proctor Cottage!
All in all great stay and would definitely come back to Tammy in the future! Great location at Hermosa beach! Lovely private one (Website hidden by Airbnb) has a microwave, mini fridge( with bottled water) and keurig.
He has a lovely terrace filled with flowers, which was a perfect place to relax. The bed was very comfortable. Michael was proactive in communicating and very quick to reply to questions.
We were able to walk to the beach in the morning and down to our favorite donut shop called Bluestar donuts amazing and a great restaurant that I think on yelp is five star called eat at Brian Burns which is right next to a wonderful coffee shop called the boy and the bear. Everything we needed in a place to stay was supplied by our wonderful hostess would stay there again for our next visit in the Redondo Beach area
This was my first time staying with a superhost, and Francis Jones certainly lived up to the designation. We got in late and he was kind, helpful, and communicated promptly and clearly. The beds and linens were super comfortable, very nicely made.
The popular dinner/bar spot “MUA” is only a 6 minute drive away. There are plenty of outlets around the studio, and the different lighting options are a plus. I didn’t want to leave!
Janet Luckman is prompt to communicate - super helpful when arriving after dark and it's hard to the see the house numbers in the neighborhood. The neighborhood appears quite safe - no concerns at all. It is quite close to several state and city parks along the shore of Puget Sound.
The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra warmth. The thoughtful provision of soaps, shampoo, tissues, coffee, water, teas are terrific. Plenty of towel , laundry service is included.
It was our first experience staying at an Airbnb and it did not disappoint. A small cold in the mornings, but there is a heater there and tons of throws and blankets. The kitchen is well stocked wit tea, coffee, sugar, oil, sauces.
Before checking in, she was very responsive and wanted to accommodate all our needs. She’s so sweet, considerate and thoughtful! She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible.
Check in was easy. Will definitely recommend other AirBnB hosts to stay at Igor's! This is coming from my parents who have never used AirBnB (due to their age) and never been to the US but Igor has made the experience so seamless.
We had more than enough space and the entire lot is very private with a beautiful backyard if you want to take a few moments to observe nature. Christine’s place was perfect for a stay that my girlfriend and I made for a long weekend. The house was perfectly clean and well decorated and easily accessible to the beach.
And, the entire suite was spotless--a clean freak's dream! This was probably the best Air BNB I stayed in. Great service and cordial reception by the host .
The shower is really awesome- so that was a plus! Close to the beach and good coffee!
The bed is very comfortable and will be a great asset to you when you are done with all of your activity in Tacoma, especially since this is centrally located. The parking spot is also a big plus.
My Dad enjoyed the tasty and healthy breakfasts. At the end of the week, we hugged our hostess and thanked her for my Dad's wonderful stay!
Brian and Hillary are so responsive and kind and make checking in and out so very easy. The loft is a full floor of open space with lots of natural light. There are so many unique touches and amenities.
Michael's loft is simply beautiful, clean and exactly as pictured. Michael is a great and friendly host, I would definitely want to stay here again if I were to come back to Chicago. Thank you so much for sharing your loft with us and it was lovely to meet you!
The kids playground across the street and dinning/shopping area within a couple minute drive. We enjoyed the easy check in/check out and the way the place is set up. Bennie Dudgeon is very responsive and available to provide any help and answer any questions.
There is no doubt that I will return to this Airbnb if I ever find myself passing-through Tacoma again. I had a wonderful experience at Jimmy's place. For one, the place was easy to find especially with Christmas lights already up.
Pro tip: we found a great gluten free spot, Robert Huckabaa, just a few min by car from the house. Michael Krieg's place has everything you could possibly need or want. He even messaged me at noon to say the space would be ready for early check in.
Friendly notes around the space helped with any questions we had and a binder gave more detailed information plus tips on where to go and places to eat. The loft was absolutely spotless, beautifully and tastefully furnished, and really fun (games, puzzles, pool table, music, and even a scooter!) If you plan to do all your cooking there, you might feel limited as there is just a hotplate, microwave and toaster oven in the kitchen, but it is enough for simple meals.
Lots of food places available and Paul had a binder full of great local tips as well. Paul and Karen were very nice and was available if we needed anything. We had a 5month old baby with us and we had all the things we needed in the guest house.
The area is definitely a mix of lower to mid income resident and students. We felt very safe walking the neighborhood. And we had plenty of room in the space to spread out!
I would recommend their place and I hope to stay again sometime. Peg and Jeff’s topographic point was absolutely beautiful. Such a great location and is really central to everything.
We were pooped and called it a night. When we woke up the position was amazing! We had some coffee and just relaxed for the morning.
Exactly what is promised is delivered. !
Highly recommended if you are staying in the Redondo Beach area. Wow! I needed a topographic point to spend the night before a morning flight out of LAX, and this room was amazing!
Location is also perfect. Dont hesitate to book!!! Would absolutely recommend Tylers place.
From the very start Bob and Sharann were warm and welcoming. The outside space is beautiful too. With its own entrance the whole space, inside and out, felt very private.
Kitchen with all the basic requirements. Uber/Lyft is cheap and easy to get to all the main parts of the city.
Thanks again for offering a wonderful place to stay. Susan’s home was our first Airbnb experience. We weren’t sure what to expect but she was there to greet us and as she walked us through her home I was absolutely floored!
Separate, private entrance with private seating area and space for bikes, boogie boards and more. Very clean and comfortable updated bathroom and bedroom. Comfy bed.
There are plates, cups, and plastic ware, which is a nice touch. I usually wear shower shoes or re-clean places, but at Mona’s place, there isn’t a need! It really is spotless.
Tiana was amazing with communicating and making us feel at ease on a staycation. Def would stay there again!
Paul’s guest house is wonderful! The location can not be beaten, a very short walk to the beach and some lovely restaurants. We were only there one full day so we didn’t get a chance to use the bikes provided, which was a shame, the route Paul recommended sounded wonderful and had we been in Redondo Beach longer we would have loved to venture a bit further.
Also the stocked fridge with juices, expensive granola, and toiletries provided was very much appreciated. It is located in a quiet residential part of town which really makes you feel like a local. Very close to Golden Gate park which has lots of activities.
With epicurean touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. The place is super easy to get in an out of without feeling obtrusive and us super comfortable with lots of great design and style. The fridge was stocked with awesome beer, the bed was incredibly comfy, and the bathroom has a heated floor...what the heck else do you need?
Definitely recommend if you need a place to stay in metro Seattle. Arthur Paddick’s topographic point is simply the best value for an entire space listing all around the Puget Sound. The pictures just don’t depict the quality and value you’ll receive.
He is perfectly welcoming, doesn't overlook details, and truly made my stay in Chicago special. Same was true for the day of my check-out - Mike kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. As for the space: it is stunning.
It was truly cold in Chicago when we were there, and it was wonderful to have plenty of clean towels, sheets, and warm blankets. We were a little surprised that he popped by to say 'hello' twice before 10 am on New Years Day (and we were rushed to get to our breakfast reservation), but it was good to speak with him. We'd love to stay again sometime.
around the space that took care of any questions we might have had. The location and view was also just as excellent as advertised. We were able to walk down through The Mission and find some delicious restaurants.
and the house was gorgeous - the photos definitely do not do it justice. Not only that, but Christian is a foodie and an Oakland connoisseur, and he spent 20+ minutes talking to me about restaurants and local food recommendations. His wife also makes bread and they grow oranges in the backyard - what an awesome, hip couple.
Tammy and Marc have truly thought of every detail to make it a comfortable stay. Walking distance to restaurants and shops and only 1 block from the beach! Would definitely recommend for a relaxing beach getaway.
It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touch that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.
We loved our stay at Ron & Laurie's place! We wish we'd had more time to enjoy the adorable back yard. They thought of everything!
Maggie's townhome consists of renovated "apartments"- ours had two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a little kitchenette and dining area. Maggie’s place was outstanding. Super cute, stylish, and clean.
Thank you so much Tiana! We had a great weekend in Tianas cottage. The location is perfect for a relaxing getaway.
Crazy nice  6) high quality beach umbrella, towels, chairs, and bikes. It was enough for two but it seems she would give more if you needed.
Melia's place was outstanding! It is in a great location, quiet neighborhood and easy to find and navigate. We did a lot in and around the city, about an hour drive anytime we went into San Francisco but that's because of bridge traffic.
Everything was perfect during our stay here! We used the hot plate and toaster oven for our cooking needs, making it very easy to save some money instead of going out to eat! The space is perfect for two and had fun amenities like a very large TV and varied National Geographic magazines.
Food around the neighbourhood was fantastic! You could easily get anything you wanted. We fell in love with this big supermarket across the apartment.
This suite was..  sweet! The place was just lovely! Probably my best experience yet.
We will try to stay again when we return to Forest Hills. Betty Maust's place has a nice ambiance and was very clean. The room was perfect for my needs...doing some work (good wifi!)
The space is furnished and decorated beautifully. We found beach towels, chairs and plaything . He offered us an umbrella as well, but we had brought ours.
Very convenient to lots of shop and the pier/beach. Would deff book again.
We were invited to a wedding at Thornwood Castle but didn't want to pay the high nightly rate to stay in a hotel in the area. Always doing "entire place" Airbnb rentals, we were a little nervous at staying at Bob and Sharann's private room. However, we couldn't have been happier.
This space is a perfect little place right near the beach. Thank you both so much
The host was very communicative, thorough and very helpful. The bungalow felt so nice and homey. She has a bed and a couch that opens up into a bed.
We could use a pack and play for our baby and we could have even used bikes. Tammy and Marc are wonderful hosts. Always very thoughtful with their guests, we had everything we might need, beach towels, bikes, disposable plates, coffee, beach chairs, scissors, you name it.
Liz’s home is beautiful, spotless, and comfortable, and it’s located just a few blocks from beach. Elizabeth home is gorgeous and our room was spacious and comfortable. The location was fantastic for going to the beach or visiting the surrounding area‘s.
The house is 10min walking from a but street with nice bars, shop and restaurant . Oakland and Berkeley offers ad well many interesting topographic point to discover. Definitely the best place we could find in the area, if we could ine day come back, for sure will come again here!
The cottage had the relaxed classy beach decor we were looking for, with a comfortable bed and a great shower. There is a private outside sitting area where we could let the dogs walk around safely on their own while we enjoyed the CA weather, a definite plus for any dog owner. Just a block or so from the ocean, it was a great location where we could easily explore the Redondo Beach neighborhood.
the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. 10/10  Thanks
Scott was such a warm and welcoming host, and his place was everything you could ask for and then some. All the amenities you could ask for in great location close to the pier. Couldn't have asked for a better experience!
Then come back and read all of the 5-star reappraisal ! Close to Dash Point State Park with views of the water, Vashon Island and the Olympic Mountains you will not find a more luxurious and well stocked home. We will definitely return!
The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.
Communication with Jeremy was very easy. If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.
I was the only person in the apartment which was fine; good for a few days stay. Arrival instructions were simple and having the lockbox for entrance and the combo door lock made it easy for arrival and departure. It all worked very well for me.
His topographic point was the perfect topographic point for me and my husband. Heater in the closest which we used because we didn’t know it’d be that cold in June! Teresa Knight TV that you can log in to your Netflix/Hulu/etc accounts.
Literally nothing bad to say. Edward Ramsey place was impeccable on every level. The home was so bright and cheerful, and the kitchen had all the amenities and then some for those that are super inspired to cook for themselves.
She was a terrific resource for local eateries and things to do, and knowing our interest in glass art, she procured a pass to the Museum of Glass in Tacoma! We plan to stay here again during our next trip to Tacoma!. Thank you, Cher Alexander.
We loved staying here! I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there.
We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Mona's place again! There was a bottle of wine, beer, and snacks waiting for us. We took full advantage of that Had a wonderful nights sleep, and woke up to an email asking if everything went ok our first night...which it did.
This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud. My daughters played pool, on the Wii, did homework on the computer and we had fun listening to music on the record player provided! The space is so clean and the location is so handy when attending events at the Tacoma Dome.
Happily, we were more focused on spending time to catch up since my son and I are on opposite seashore , and hanging at the loft provided us that...even though our pool skills could use some work! There were little notes all over the space to let me know which things I could use (a fun sketching table, puzzles, and a big projector to watch Arthur Paddick and play my favorite playlists!) The atmosphere Jeremy Johnson and Hillary have brought to this loft is fun and I'd recommend it to anyone with some artistic flair who wants a getaway near the Tacoma dome!
Unfortunately there was construction next door, luckily I had earplugs and I’m not a light sleeper. !
I can’t rave enough! Thanks so much Tyler !
Scott was so welcoming and responsive, and very thoughtful about making sure that we had everything we needed. The neighborhood is peaceful, with easy access to public transit and some great cafes and restaurants nearby (try brunch at m. henry!)
Both the room and location are wonderful, it really is like a hotel experience only more stylish and there was a sofa (very comfortable) nearby if you don't want to sit on the bed. Speaking of the bed, it's really comfortable and perfect for resting after a day of hiking the hills of San Francisco, and Tyler provides multiple sheet options for you which is a nice touch. It is also worth mentioning the view which is something else, from both the bedroom and the living room.
Our stay at Derek and Gregory Simons place was amazing. Though we had an early check in, the rooms were speck free, clean and ready. Edward Ramsey was so warm and also helped us with our bags.
We did not drive to Jeremy Johnson's house but she offered parking in her driveway. Jeremy Johnson provided separate entry codes for the front door and the room. The room itself was better than expected.
She also has bagel in the fridge as well as eggs. The outdoor space is really pretty at night. With lights surrounding the area as well as the orange tree she has.
The bikes provided us with one of our favorite days in LA and it was these thoughtful amenities that made it one of the best Airbnb corset I’ve ever had!!! Hope to be back soon!
Sophisticated yet very homey. Lovely modern kitchen with everything we needed. Truly nice spot.
Amazing room and amenities! It feels better than most hotels. Comfortable bed, comfortable spaces, thoughtful touches with the snacks, list of places to eat and explore, and the towel warmer!
Shelton Gill and May are great hosts. They are very courteous and accommodating. I highly recommend Shelton Gill’s topographic point .
Star and Arnold Jackson provided so many nice touches, including bikes, a hammock, beach towels, premium TV (Netflix, Prime) - even aloe vera gel in the fridge for the inevitable. House is a five minute walk to beach but also situated in a quiet cul Delaware sac, aside a pond. Coffee and filter water provided, but there's no kitchen, so plan to eat out or buy prepared foods.
We could not expect anything better for our last days in LA. She welcomed and treated us like friends. I would certainly spend more days in this house if I could.
OMG, the bathroom is so well stocked with literally almost anything you need, even hair products and a dryer! The towel warm was a luxurious touch. He’s such a great host, I would absolutely stay again.
Kelly's master suite is a FANTASTIC place to stay in the city. I HIGHLY recommend this unit and will definitely be back!
The walk in closet was awesome. The shower was gorgeous. Edwin Green was very hospitable and friendly.
The space was clean and efficient. When we were planning our exploration of San Fran, Lori Stewart and Lauri visited our space, drawing maps, suggesting favorite restaurant . It was sweet.
That’s rly sweet. There’s a few restaurants nearby which offers decent brunch & dinner. Am in love with the vintage store at telegaraph Ave (walkable distance) opposite aunt Clifford Winkler restaurant.
Fortunately, Elizabeth was willing to lose a good night's sleep to meet us, after our flight was canceled and our final flight arrived so late. The bed was very comfortable, as were the pillows. Closet space is amazing!
Would recommend! Francis Jones is a wonderful host! She is very sweet, helpful and good communicator.
It was stunningly pretty and very quiet and safe. This is definitely a fantastic get-away in the heart of one of the most beautiful and stylish neighborhoods in San Francisco!
My boyfriend went to the gymnasium downstairs, while I enjoyed the coziness of lounging around in the living room. My boyfriend and I had minimal interaction with the host, Aaron, but he’s easily accessible. Really nice guy and genuine when we spoke on our last day!
Marc was very helpful! making sure we had bikes , boogie boards, and chairs for the beach. we were able to drop off our bag earlier the checkin, which was awesome.
Guys! Francis Jones is an absolutely wonderful host; his work and art literature can be found spread all over the studio, it is quite inspiring. The place is nestled in a lovely block on River North practically unnoticed to the eye if you are not paying attention.
It was quiet and had plenty of street parking. Plenty of towels, blankets, and sheets. The radiator heaters were a nice reminder of home (the East Coast).
I contact Tony and Marcos Blount to ask what I should do. Within ten minutes, Tony was there with a replacement, and told me not to worry about it. While he was at it, he replaced the propane tank on the grill for me.
Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short block (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway. So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shop .
Recommended! This cabin provided such a lovely respite. It is so quiet and peaceful there.
Her response was quick and she was always caring about us. !I definitely recommend her place!! !
They are lovely, kind people and we look forward to seeing them again. You can also walk to Laurel shopping district for a bite to eat and other shopping needs. One note: This place is best for a couple or small family, as you have to walk through one bedroom to get to the other.
They couldn’t have been better host . :)
Shantell Preusser was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area. While attached to another house, we never heard the neighbors or had any issues. The house is pretty close to some nearby homeless shelter & streets filled with tents,  but this is a common occurrence all over the Seattle/Tacoma area & we never once felt unsafe.
We spent 10 days in these charming garden apartment and what shall say....... everything is exactly as Heather describes it. It is really charming, quiet, warmly decorated, the garden is so beautiful and for your own, the beach is only 100 m away, the muni transportation system to go downtown or where ever you want is just 2 blocks away, the same with the golden gate park. Supermarkets, nice cafes and restaurants are also nearby and you really don't need a car to explore everything.
• The bathroom was outfitted with much more than we needed. The towels were soft and fluffy and there were plenty of them. • The lights and heat are controlled by a Nest system with sensors to turn lights come on and off as you enter and leave a room.
Paul is a great Airbnb host. Great location in a very nice guest house. Would recommend to others and will hopefully return one day.
Super clean, well directed with the perfect floor plan. Great linens and towels. The shower is awesome.
Very easy and accessible which is exactly what we needed as we we're visiting for an outrigger race. Safe neighborhood, left my canoe on the truck overnight with no issues. Thank you Bennie Dudgeon!
All of our guests commented on this alone and stunning property which allowed both intimacy and plenty of space to spread out. The furnishings, artwork, and decor add to the charm and whimsy of Wiseacre. Everywhere one turns there is something else to discover - many pieces provide a chuckle, as does Jeremy Johnson himself (and his adorable Lauren Jensen Charles Spaniel, Charlotte).
She is very sweet, helpful and good communicator. Her place is very well located, very stylish and clean! I had a parking space for my car and coffee machine!
The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a bike shop close by called Switching Gears. Also, there is a quaint coffee shop and a beautiful preserve a few blocks away. We had a great time!
It’s quiet, convenient, and close the beach. The room was so broad and comfortable! This is the gold standard of any place we stayed!
The location can’t be beat (especially for the price.) Self check-in as well as parking was all a breeze and if you have any questions regarding your stay, Marc and Francis Jones are always readily available to assist you. They do a great job of recommending restaurants, shops and nightlife all within walking distance which is just one less thing you have to worry about.
Before I been there, the host sent me  a lot of note to help me find this house. On top of that, the location is awesome - two blocks from the beautiful beach and the bike path and close to tons of restaurants. We loved that motorcycle were provided!
The deck is gorgeous and it was the BEST location. We took one Uber the whole time we were there. Luis Hawkins made sure we had everything we needed while we were there and we loved chatting with him!
The beach is just a hop skip and a jump away! This is truly a precious gem! My wife and I will only stay here now if we go to LA.
I would not hesitate to recommend this listing. The cleanliness of her home was impecable, and the beds, and pillows were super comfortable providing for a great nights sleep. My kids loved that the tv had a Roku stick.
Loved the little back yard oasis where our daughter enjoyed taking some amazing pictures. It was such a warm genuine welcome. Thank you again so much and we will definitely recommend your place for future stays...Tanya and Francis Jones 07.09.2018
We were met with incredible hospitality, a beautiful space, a super friendly porch, and a fantastic location. You could walk to a place to eat or down to the beach. We were able to keep our vehicle rental off the street and park in a private space.
Lindsay Brown is very friendly, helpful and thoughtful . Her home is in a great neighborhood, safe, quiet, close to beach. We will definitely stay at her home again.
My husband is a man of few words...and fewer superlatives. She could not have been a more welcoming host. Not only was the space immaculate, she had left us a fantastic variety of fruits, baked goods, beverages and even small samples of local ice cream.
Amazing, amazing amazing! We were so happy when we arrived. We felt at peace, happy, and safe.
I liked how they had put a Keurig, water and small brochures of local activity and places in the bookcase. The room and bathroom were nicely decorated, very clean, and they even provided shampoo/conditioner and little soaps! I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend these hosts!
Scott was so thoughtful in every detail of setting up our stay. Also, there were so many extra amenities we missed or were short on that Scott provided (ex. Lotion, sunscreen, shampoo/conditioner, and even floss!...
Don't overlook this cozy little apartment by the ocean--this place is a gem! We really liked the chill surfer vibe of the neighborhood, plus it was really nice to come back here after a day of exploring San Francisco for a glass of wine and some ocean air. Walking on the beach in the morning and watching surfers out on the water was a real treat!!
The lockbox was an excellent idea, I’ve never seen anything like that before. The backyard was so pretty as well as scenic. The room was comfy & tastefully decorated, tv was just the perfect size & my most favorite part was the beautiful shower & bathroom area.
Paul is always responsive and actively communicates with his guests. I will definitely be looking to book here again in the future.
I just loved it!! This is now on my "favorite's" list. Luis Hawkins greeted me and showed me around.
Roberta Hallenbeck was the most gracious, amusing , warming, charming host. Don’t hesitate. Book.
Bennie Dudgeon was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. Jeremy Johnson selection of games, book , local magazines, and a Wii.
This is one of those rare airbnb's that you don't want anyone else to know about! LOL. Great topographic point , so clean, easy parking, the location was fabulous...the bikes, the outdoor seating, the quietness, the uber comfortable bed, the amazing hot shower, etc.
We enjoyed the Odd Otter brew pub and the donut place about five door down. We could have had fresh brewed coffee with creamer in the home and taken advantage of the provided snacks, but we decided to wander in the morning. The bed was comfortable and there were lots of pillows.
Nice place for a quick visit. Beautifully decorated. Quick response to any of our questions.
Staying at Jose’s was magnificent. The neighborhood itself is very family oriented and I loved having his driveway to park in, made life a lot easier! We will definitely be back!
They also had great beach cruisers that they lend to guests, and we had a great time exploring the area and beaches with the bikes. Great stay, would def stay again if we're back in the area.
Good off street parking. Christine was an extremely welcoming and gracious hostess and gave my partner and I a good feel for the city of Virginia Beach as first time visitors. The guest house was exactly as described and pictured, and had pretty much everything we needed and more.
Tony and Attina have  laid out the minimal space in such a way that all needs were met -- beyond what I had expected. I TOTALLY recommend this sweet location to anyone wanting to give themselves an extra overnight treat.
Wifi was consistent, No TV but we have a mini projector that we travel with...just for unwinding and watching a movie at the end of the night. Thank you both for having us!
Such an amazing lady!! Neighborhood is safe. Great location!!
Joseph Lewis's place is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museum . Bed and pillows were comfy; the private bathroom had a bathtub with shower. Shantell Preusser was fast.
! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable.
Clifford Winkler and James Walker were great host . The room was perfect temperature and comfortable. I loved being able to have a cup of coffee in my room and takin my time getting up.
The room itself is so broad and the bed had me sleeping so deeply I forgot where I was when I woke up. I loved her home and yard with ducks! Quack quack   The neighborhood is pleasant for walking around if you stick to the high streets.
I can’t wait until my next Oakland visit and the chance to stay at the casita! On our last trip we stayed in several hotels and dined out every night. This time we wanted something more cost effective, more homelike , and a kitchen to prepare meals.
Christopher Brown! Blown away by all expectations. Scott is by far the best host I've ever stayed with, super nice with awesome recommendations.
The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. They had two small children and there was plenty of room for everything that they brought. There is also a nice fenced in backyard living space when the weather is nice for you to enjoy.
Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a small loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:  chefs kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. I look forward to returning! Mahalo!
Heathers apartment was exactly as I expected it to be, it is exactly as pictured, clean and aired. Having the beach directly across the road was icing on the cake and there are some great coffee shop locally. The metro is also just a few minutes walk and can get you to pretty much anywhere you want, there are also bus Michigan dotted around to get you to the zoo etc very quickly.
We felt super lucky to have found this place! We really loved our time here! :)
This place was amazing ! There were many amenities thrown in and water in the electric refrigerator . The host was readily available for anything we might need.
入住的体验实在太好了,我们那天飞机延误导致凌晨四点才到geroge的住处,没想到geroge没有睡一直在等我们,还超级热情的帮我们提行李介绍房间,实在非常感动｡房子的环境也超级好,干净有品味,有小院子可以bbq和烤火,是非常让人向往的小屋,房子在奥克兰,奥克兰的整体环境非常舒适,跟旧金山downtown的感觉完全相反,第一晚去check in的时候还看到了两只小鹿并肩过马路,实在太棒了,如果你看到了这个房子一定要来入住哦! It's a wonderful experience,We didn't arrive at geroge's house until 4 o 'clock in the morning due to the flight delay. Unexpectedly, geroge was waiting for us all the time without sleeping.
So great, we would definitely stay again. This apartment, although small, was perfect for our purposes. We found it comfortable (great bed), clean, quiet, beautiful (the bathroom, especially is gorgeous), and we had everything we needed and very close to the strand, the beach and restaurants.
Everything was nice and clean and the monetary value value ratio is very good. We enjoyed our stay. Beds were comfortable, everything was clean and nice.
Hope we have another trip in the future, we'll definitely stay again! This was my first AirBnB experience and it was simply amazing  - Zeena is a fantastic host who cares for her guests in the best possible way. We had a good room to sleep and it was a pleasure to wake up to the chirping of bird , something perfect to start your day.
I learned about a lot of things I can add and improve upon after staying here. Thanks Gregory Simons!
It’s extremely charming and has a lot of nice little tasteful touches. Thomas George, the host, was super thoughtful and responsive all the manner through. Check in was a breeze.
Also recommendations are printed out for you. Scott’s topographical point is the best! The room is broad , the bed is incredibly comfortable.
Both me and my wife love the way you decorated your unit of measurement and its cleanliness. This is definitely a rare gem to find because it really is a beautiful cottage. It was truly an amazing spot and we would definitely recommend her topographic point to any of our friends and family looking for a place to stay in the bay.
Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. Great smells, poofy robes, but tight shower. Susan is incredibly attentive, accommodating of your needs, but respectful of your privacy.
She also has bagels in the fridge as well as eggs. The outdoor space is really pretty at night. With lights surrounding the area as well as the orange tree she has.
Numerous personal touch make staying here a very relaxing and enjoyable time. We have stayed at numerous places in the Hermosa Beach/Redondo Beach area and this is bar none the best place to stay. Thank you Tiana - it I could give more than 5 star I would!
They absolutely loved it. This was a quick Uber to the mission where we went out for food and drinks. It’s also located in a quiet neighborhood so it was a nice retreat for them to come back and get a good nights sleep without the noise of the city.
All in all, a wonderful experience. You will love this cozy nostalgic trailer from the 1950s. Michael, Capra and Vyla are a wonderful host family!
Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city. In comparing the prices when looking at Chicago, this was by far the cheapest and despite it being a "shared" airbnb, it felt like a hotel (since we had an Ensuite) just a LOT cheaper! Also about a 1 minute walk to Gino's which was my favorite of all the deep dish pizza that I tried in Chicago!
Already planning our next trip to Tacoma! This little cottage is a great find, and Michelle is an incredibly generous host. Cottage includes hair dryer, and pretty much anything you might forget to bring with you (extra toothbrush, toothpaste etc).
I stayed at Tyler's place for a night and it felt like I was at a hotel. I slept like a baby! I also really enjoyed how eco-friendly everything was; from the spa local products being kept in glass bottles instead of plastic in the restroom to the ability to dim the lights and conserve energy.
Alejandrina Anderson topographic point is everything you want in a stay away from home. The location is excellent for visiting Redondo Beach Pier, and many nearby amenities. The value is great for being so close to the beach.
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. Kitchen was well equipped and has nice appliances and countertop . The TV is great place to relax after a long day hiking or exploring!
The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in "real" vicinity .
Our family enjoyed the space. The check-in process was easy. The photos and description are accurate.
Scott was so thoughtful in every detail of setting up our stay. We felt very welcomed and at home. There was still a great amount of privacy in having a shared space.
It was so cleanly,  impeccably designed, welcoming, private, and warm-we lacked nothing and only 2 blocks from beach! This was a special time for us. Thank you for making it possible!
I wish I could give more than five stars. It was a delightful stay. Thanks so much again to Michelle and Jeni.
This place is great! The location is fantastic, parking makes life so much easier, and the added bonus of bikes and all the beach supplies you need makes it even better! The space is super cozy, the bed is comfortable, and all of the extra touches made me feel right at home.
There are just no words to describe this place. After me and my boyfriend lost our dear grandmothers within four days apart, we needed a retreat. From the very second I pulled in the driveway I felt at home.
You do have access to the beach, however. There are adirondack chair set out and there's a short set of steps from the yard down to the beach. And the position there IS expansive!
This was one of the finest Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. However when we met Tyler, he welcomed us so nicely and provided us with a batch of tip on where to eat and what to do. The place itself is nothing short of amazing.
We felt like we were guests of Mark and Dennis Steward's staying in a topographic point they created out of love and with supernumerary for comfort and enjoyment. We loved staying at Dennis Steward's place! We were there a total of 5 night , and thoroughly enjoyed our time there.
Elizabeth’s place is everything you want in a stay away from home. Only a few blocks from the ocean, it’s also in a great location. Highly recommended!
The guest house was very clean and spacious. Will definitely be back and would recommend to solo or traveling couples!
Every time we go back to Tacoma in the future, we will be staying here. We initially were going to stay for just 2 nights, but our plans required for a longer stay and Jeanna was more than accommodating  When we tried extending our stay, we had issues with the Airbnb website and Jeanna was so understanding and caring about the issue we were having. Couldn’t have asked for a better host.
They even checked in with me throughout my stay to see if there was anything I needed, or if they could pick up anything at Whole Foods for me while they were out. The room is spacious and so pleasing to the eye. The bed is incredibly comfortable - like nothing I've ever had at a hotel or AirBnB ever, and the comforter was lush and cozy.
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. Tyler’s place is conveniently located near the Land’s End Coastal Trail which for adventurous hikers will take you all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. The magnificent vistas you will see on your hike will make you forget you’re actually getting a great workout.
Location is desirable and my stay felt very private. Thank you Elizabeth!! !
Thanks for a great place to stay! 5 star stay: pros: great location, stylish and well equipped, private entrance and parking, clean and bright, great wi-fi, oversized bathroom, and walkability to beach, shops and restaurants. cons: none.
She came over and we had a very cozy afternoon of studying and reading. I highly recommend this place!
Just stayed here a second time. Adorable. I am blown away by how many thoughtful touches Lindsay Brown and Marc provide, from beach gear to a bike, to a variety of coffees in the room (and even a kettle if you are a tea person).
It is so close to many amazing restaurants and cafes. Public transport into the city was no problem at all, it was about half an hour to most tourists destinations including union square, fisherman’s wharf and golden gate bridge. Chris and Rocky provided an amazing home away from Home in San Francisco.
Jo was a fabulous host. She was a terrific resource for local restaurant and things to do, and knowing our interest in glass art, she procured a pass to the Museum of Glass in Tacoma! A first rate host in a great neighborhood.
We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestion and handwritten welcome. Natalia was also a great host she communicated clearly and even checked in with us to make sure all was well. Thanks Natalia!
She was quick to reply when we had questions. SOL, Times Square etc. Something to consider.
Amazing, very cosy, very comfy beds, stylish apartment. Close to local transport, short walk away. Great hosts.
Leslie’s thoughtful, speedy  attentiveness made the lodging part of our trip an effortless high point. When my gf and I walked through the door we were blown away by how awesome this place is. I wish we could’ve spent more time just chilling at this home lol we were seriously in love!
I was able to walk were I needed because the location is perfect and so convenient. Igor and May were wonderful hosts. Their home is in a beautiful and very safe neighborhood.
The room was spacious, very open and clean and perfect for two people. It is a close drive from major sights like Fisherman’s Wharf but you can walk it too. Do recommend this beautiful stay which is perfect for short or long trips and James Walker is a fantastic and very accommodating host!
Very generous, thank you!! Susan was AMAZING!! My parents were visiting from out of town for their first trip to the Seattle/Tacoma area and to meet my fiance for the first time.
The space is advertised as a little noisy, but I found I hardly noticed the traffic or the trains (if you are very noise sensitive there are ear plugs provided for sleeping). I was also expecting a hot and stuffy space, being in a loft in the middle of summer, but the AC was strong and the space is just so open and comfortable. The kitchenette is perfect for whipping up a little food, but it is not a kitchen to prepare a big meal in.
Check in was easy. Access to the nearest public transport to the city is very close. Safe neighbourhood and very good value for money.
Absolutely wonderful location. Literally 2 blocks from the beach. And Paul had a couple of beach cruisers that he let us use as part of our reservation!
Shantell Preusser’s home was warm, inviting, and so clean. Shantell Preusser's house was wonderful place to stay! The location is outstanding - good area, quite place, private parking and close all places of interests.
Everything was as expected and described perfectly. The bathroom is very clean and updated. Edward Ramsey and Marc have added several thoughtful touches that make you feel very comfortable during your stay.
This studio is small but packs a lot of punches! The location was a true Airbnb in that you are in a neighbourhood, but still close to restaurants and BART (Mission). We especially enjoyed the tea/coffee/breakfast nook with its kettle!
The cottage has everything you need to feel immediately at home, check in and check out a breeze, great food in walking distance, and the beautiful beach steps away — I woke up to the sound of crashing waves every morning. And the bed! I asked her where she bought it so I can buy one!!
Jackie baked some bread and it was delicious. The house is very close to West Oakland BART station and it's a perfect location to visiting both Oakland and San Francisco. I definitely recommend to stay at their topographical point
with coffee maker, fridge, and fresh water. I like the way that our space was separate from the hosts' space, yet they were totally available. BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.
I loved the photos to describe how to find the entrance to the unit. I wish every host did this...I arrived during the day but still found it super helpful. Thanks!
It is the best Ikea styling I have ever seen in real life. The furniture, the decoration, the artwork are all simple, yet we felt like we could move right in and live here as a forever home. • The bed is like a cozy nest (loved the pillows).
We could not have been more pleased. We loved riding motorcycle , being one block from the beach and the comfortable bed. I can’t wait to stay here again!
Location is perfect for walking down to the waterfront. I'd gladly stay here anytime.
Nevas place was beautiful and clean. She accommodated all my request and was quick to communicate. I would rexommmend this place to a single person or couple staying in the area.
The location is also perfect, as it is close to Metro bus station and 63 Drive-Rego Subway station. Thanks again, Raquel Eastham!
The place is also incredibly convenient, a block away from the free train into business district Tacoma. The other wonderful aspect is their awesome art. I would definitely stay here again.
We went to the beach the night we arrived, which was just a short little drive, no more than 15 minutes with traffic. There is a microwave, standard coffeemaker and mini fridge in the space if you them but there were also several dining options nearby. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Michael Krieg place again!
Bennie Dudgeon and Ernie are warm and hospitable. They offered clear directions and instructions and Bennie Dudgeon was accommodating when I texted to check in early. Their home is attractive and tranquil, with a lovely garden in back.
 picture are accurate, and if anything kind of undersell the place. The queen size bed is comfortable and clean, but a bit on the firm side. (Which I prefer.
Chris and Tim's place was awesome! It was so relaxing and quiet. A block from the beach, it can't get any better.
Paul was a great host with amazing recommendations for anyone unfamiliar with the area! John Brashier, quiet, pretty space. I met Paul - he's very friendly.
10 out of 10. Angela's place is perfect for 1-2. My daughter spent the weekend there for a Mom/daughter birthday weekend.
Communication was EXCELLENT! The minor issues we had were quickly solved with a quick text. If ever a need for a place in Tacoma again, we'll be booking here.
Betty Maust personal touches make it extra special, fresh flowers, and snacks. I sleep better there than I do at home. That being said, the bed is super comfortable.
There were also nice excess touches of beach towels, snacks, bikes, water, iPhone speaker and remote controled skylight blinds. You can tell he thinks about the guest and cares about the quality of your stay.
Wow, if you are looking for an oasis in the middle of fast paced downtown Tacoma- THIS is the place for you! Gloria's place is beautiful, so spacious and has everything you could ever  really want in a home away from home. Gloria is also very responsive and makes sure you have everything you need which is so nice.
The location of the house was antic - it was 15 minutes or less from grocery stores, 24 hour fitness, parks, hiking trails, movie theaters, restaurants, etc. If I come back to Oakland by myself, I’d definitely stay here again.
It was very comfortable, relaxing and VERY clean!!! The pool and hot tub were incredible and so relaxing and the dogs were very sweet. Our kids loved when they come over to visit.
Although we only stayed for a night on our way back, I cannot recommend Elizabeth's place enough. Huge bed and room, clean, comfy, nice view and area. Elizabeth was super friendly and helpfull, she even checked us in earlier.
We enjoyed the private outdoor patio area right outside the bedroom. And the Apple TV was a nice amenity to have. We would definitely stay here again!
This is a small, but convenient apartment. Just what we needed for one night before we took our flights back home. It's very close to Redondo and Hermosa beach - we walked to both beaches the following morning.
A stone throws distance from Whole Foods to pick up some food and the neighborhood is lovely and we felt very safe. The only downside is that the bathroom is outside the unit albeit a private one. It was a little cold during our visit so walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night was a tad little inconvenient but this was clearly advertised in the listing so it did not come as a surprise.
No complaints! Elizabeth was such a wonderful host. She was very informative and responsive when we had questions prior to the trip.
We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, snacks, water, and a fridge. We enjoyed the view from the deck before we got dressed and headed to a lovely dinner at the Cliff House. We then came back to enjoy the view after dark and were able to watch some Netflix before heading to bed.
They do a great job of recommending restaurants, shops and nightlife all within walking distance which is just one less thing you have to worry about. If it is available, book this place without hesitation.
Melissa is nicest of hosts! From the moment I arrived It felt like I was staying at a friend’s house. We hit it off right away and even talked in kitchen for a while before I unloaded my car and got a tour of the house!
However, this ended up being something I loved. If you want a place that is peaceful and, to use the Airbnb descriptor - magical, you need to stay here. We loved the modern design and really cool efficient use of space and the placid garden setting.
Noe Valley is the best area when you dont want the hustle and bustle from Fishermens Warff. The appartment is really spacious and you even have a beautifull and nice smelling garden. Pegg made us homemade chocolade chip cookies and left it at the appartment when we went out.
We had the upstairs room  and while it said a shared bathroom I think we were the only ones using it. No air conditioning (most homes in the area don’t have it) so we slept with the windows open each night and that was nice. They did provide a fan but we only used it on the first warm night.
Highly recommend, as long as you are able to negotiate a long flight of stairs. Food around the neighbourhood was fantastic! There’s many cafes to chill out too.
From the second I saw the description of this home I was really drawn toward how beautiful it looked. I sent an email to Nina and she responded super quick and gladly welcomed us to stay at her home. I booked it right away without any issues.
Morning sunrise and evening sundown are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area. Gorgeous views! And, just as important to note - the friendliness of Chuck is real!
When that was not sufficient, the next morning he put in the AC. We were “cool” from there. The location is walking distance to some great restaurants on the water.
Elizabeth's home is clean, beautiful and has a hotel-like feel. The room is very spacious, bed is incredibly comfy, bathroom is spotless, and there is parking on premises. Only a five minute drive to the water.
I love fresh air so in order to air out the studio I had to leave the door open a little. Regardless, I would stay there again without a doubt. I left my phone charger and Angela was super helpful and let me borrow one while I bought a new one for myself.
Tiana and Derek were lovely host !Extremely accommodating, friendly and very understanding if we needed anything! Tiana was very prompt in responding to my texts and Derek was very kind to fill up air on the cruiser bikes that my brother and I thoroughly enjoyed! The cottage is super clean and zen like!
The hosts are friendly and helpful. Christian gave us brochures and tip on what to do as soon as we got there. Jackie baked some bread and it was delicious.
Great location! Love all the beach supplies-  chairs, toys, towel, beach bag! Perfect for a couple or family with 1 small child.
We make use of the wonderful washer and dryer that are available so that we can pack light. This was a great experience for my daughter and I! We were unfortunate in that we couldn't meet our hosts as they were away, but also very fortunate in that we had the whole lovely house to ourselves, for the price of a shared accommodation.
Loved our stay here. Lovely area and very handy to shops, restaurants and the subway link. You don't need to go far for the best value shopping around.
We loved our stay at this stylish studio. The vicinity was beautiful and we spent a batch of time just walking around and admiring the homes. The topographic point itself was quiet and spacious, with a private entrance and great natural lighting.
I met Teresa Knight multiple times during my stay; they were nice to talk to and they gave me multiple arrow on things to in the area that suited my interest. If back in the area again I would love to stay at their cottage again.
The screen in porch is nothing short of magical. Cute little touches of culture and art are sprinkled throughout the rooms without making the space feel too “lived in.”  That bathtub and shower will make your trip so worth it. AND THE BED!
Teresa Knight didn’t miss a detail. All in all, I would highly recommend Teresa Knight’s topographical point as somewhere to stay if you are in the Tacoma area. One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had.
Truly a great experience! Angela’s place was stylish, modern, clean, and provides just what I needed for my stay. The self check in process is so easy and the location of the apartment is convenient,safe and easily accessible(no need to go through gates or fences or side alleys,etc.
There were lots of nice touches and this had more of a bed and breakfast vibe to it. Dan & Traci are also really great hosts! Dan gave my sister and I a full tour of the home and ensured that all concerns were covered, and Traci blessed us with a delicious, hearty breakfast each morning!
I really can't find a single thing to list here that I didn't like. Absolutely wonderful.
Overall a great airbnb, as described, and would stay there again! And there’s not many great choices since it’s Federal Way. The shower is also very small and hard to use and I’m 5’4 and 100 pounds.
We will try to stay again when we return to Forest Hills. Highly recommend this AirBnB.
It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!
We would highly recommend John Brashier and John Brashier's B&B as a place to stay. They have book maps and guides available as well. The apartment is a cosy upper level with stylish bedroom, intimate living room with small kitchenette with microwave and small refrigerator.
But I never did! If you are coming to Tacoma, you won't regret staying with Stephanie! She is such a sweetheart and put so many cute details into her place.
Fantastic host, and the studio was clean, well-appointed, and very stylishly decorated. We stayed with our two child this time, but we'll be back again for a longer trip to enjoy this fun property close to the beach and some great restaurant (try Mama D's, especially if you have kids. Excellent food and family friendly!)
He is fast to respond and assist with any question you might have. Don’t miss out on a lovely stay here.
Tammy and Marc are exponential on what they do and are by far the most amazing and accommodating hosts ever. The room has all it needs and is centrally located within walking/biking/driving distance to all but seems like an oasis all on its own. Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any!
Perfect location, shower was amazing, very spacious & the bed was heavenly. Very easy and accessible which is exactly what we needed as we we're visiting for an outrigger race. Walking distance to the pier & beach.
We stayed at Wiseacre for an extended holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. Chuck is an excellent host - communication was always prompt and clear and we felt very welcome to share his home immediately. We have highly recommended and shared this opportunity with friend and family.
It’s clean and cozy and has everything you need for a weekend in NYC. The subway line into Manhattan is just a 15 minute walk away. Maggie is an excellent host, answered all our question quickly as well!
We really loved our time here! Tyler has put much thoughts and efforts into the overall experience & added extras (e.g. extension chords/chargers, female toiletries, night light etc) which makes one feel as though they never left home.
Susan & Khahn’s place is easily the nicest airb&b we have stayed in. The suite is so cozy and welcoming and beautifully furnished and there are so many thoughtful touches throughout from little caramels at the bedside to fresh hard boiled eggs, pastries and fruit for breakfast. Her communication was excellent, the space was spotlessly clean and comfortable, and she provided lists of local places for breakfast, dinner, happy hours, etc - it was such a welcoming and beautiful space and we will definitely come again when in the area.
The place was so clean and Paul has an amazing local guide! Plus the beach is walking distance!! Definitely look forward to staying here again!
He left a ha du guide for us to follow of the local places to visit. This is a return trip for us and we were unaware of some of the new kings in the area. He allowed us the use of bikes - which saved on rentals - and even replaced on of the bikes that had a flat.
Tammy and Marc were very helpful with everything. Me and my Sister went to Hermosa to have a Sister's  weekend. We chose Hermosa because we used to live there.
Matthew An was a amazing host and super nice! She offered me eggs and toast so i can make breakfast over the the span of my visit if i needed. She offered tips and always checked up to make sure things were going good.
angela's beach bungalow is THE perfect cozy stay for a couple or two friends and is one of the best airbnb's i've ever stayed in. walking into the space immediately put me at ease. candles were lit, everything was light, bright and clean.
Elizabeth's place is wonderful. It was our second time and we will be back! I love that there is a desk now, since I do have to work a bit while away.
We drove to the places we needed to go so I am not sure if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops. But Jeanna supplied coffee and granola bars so we were set in the morning. A couple things that you may consider that were not big problems for us but may not be perfect for other travelers: there is one big comfy bed in the bedroom and the bathroom is in the same room without a privacy door.
Her bungalow was adorable and charming. It had all of the amenities you would need and Sheri Vowell was always easy to reach. Sheri Vowell provided welcome bite , eggs and bread.
Pamela Drew place was warm and cozy. It had everything we needed and more. First off, the bed sympathizer and pillows were amazing!
We had an excellent stay at Tyler’s place. Also worth mentioning is the access to a washer and dryer - when you’re away from home for almost 2 weeks, it’s beyond helpful to be able to have a chance to do some laundry and have more clean clothes. Thanks Tyler for setting up a very lovely place for guests!
Apartment is cozy and comfortable for two people. Overall we had enjoyed our stay! Thank you Betty Maust for your hospitality:)
He is fast to respond and assist with any questions you might have. Don’t miss out on a lovely stay here.
which my wife loved, it made us feel like we were wanted as guests. Lots of windows and natural sunlight, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower was amazing. Christopher Brown is great as well.
Super convenient. Not to mention the bed were extremely comfortable! Would definitely love to stay here again if ever in the Chicago area.
Neva was extremely welcoming & accommodating. This was my first stay with air bnb & she exceeding expectations. It was the cut little place with everything you needed.
Elizabeth is a kind, friendly host. Just a few blocks from the beach. Great value for the money!
Good off street parking. We had more than enough space and the entire lot is very private with a beautiful backyard if you want to take a few moments to observe nature. Wish we had stayed longer, but if/when we return to the beachfront we'll definitely be keeping Christine's place in mind!
The place is also incredibly convenient, a block away from the free train into downtown Tacoma. Brian and Hillary were also very accommodating and on top of their communication (I quickly received a response to all my questions). Check-in is a breeze and the star lights were a wonderful welcome.
Big room with a king bed, master bath. It is walking distance from the beach, restaurants, Whole Foods and good coffee. Elizabeth is an attentive and kind host!
Great room with plenty of space and private bath. Really close to the beach as well. We were just passing through town so it was nice to have a welcoming topographic point to stay.
She was always very sweet and kind to us. We would definitely stay here again! The room was beautiful and worth every penny!
I can’t wait to go back believe me when I say this guy went above and beyond and it was second to none! The beach isn't crowded at all--and the water is pretty calm and fairly shallow, great for younger kids. The apartment doesn't only have a great location, it was sparkling clean and had a great beach house vibe to it.
Amy & Dennis’s cabin exceeded my expectations. The bathrobes and slippers they provide are also a nice touch! The cabin is very homey, and the coffee, tea, water, sugar, and cream provided were all very much appreciated.
A most remarkable aspect of our stay was the surprisingly numerous items that are available for use, from makeup mirror to the fantastic 3-speed cruiser bicycles, that made our stay so much easier and more pleasant. What an incredible find.... I almost don’t want to share it so it will be available again for me next time...
So spacious. Everything was sparkling clean. Shower so nice.
She even had beach towels, beach umbrella and anything else you may need for a trip to the beach. There is a little garden patio that is a nice place to relax in the evening. We were lucky to sit and chat with Angela one evening.
My wife and I came here for a long weekend and really enjoyed ourselves. The place was very clean and the TV was huge (75 in. I think) .. Christine had chairs, umbrellas, beach towels and blankets we were able to bring to the beach with us.
This is one of the best properties we've stayed in for a few reasons: great location, value, quality of space and amenities provided. All the beach gear you need (bikes, boards, chairs, towel , toys - everything!) and a very well stocked kitchen (cooking oils, seasonings,  gadgets, etc).
The walk up can easily deter you but oh man once you walk in- your transported to another place. Everything was spotless and everything you need is provided. I would reccomend this loft to anyone staying in Tacoma.
They're space is absolutely beautiful, and so thoughtful. Incredible design, and extremely comfortable. The space is actually much bigger than I had originally thought before I arrived in person, which is usually the opposite of what I expect!
Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a little loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:  chefs kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. Betty Maust place was beyond expectation. If you think the place is great from the pictures, you’ll be pleasantly surprised and pleased when you arrive!
Her place is minutes from the beach, it’s spotless- the ad doesn’t do the place justice. I’m new to the area and I offered for Raquel Eastham to come take a class at the gym I train at and she happily came. Her beautiful home is quiet.
We will def choose this place again if we visit SF. This was an extremely nice place, located in a really fabulous neighbourhood with plenty of parks and restaurants to explore. The room was broad , very open and clean and perfect for two people.
They had complied an incredibly extensive guest book for local tips and offered lots of delicious restaurant suggestions. There is also some fresh coffee and homemade granola to enjoy along with other thoughtful touches. The only thing to bear in mind is for light sleepers as there are some loud train nearby and quite a lot of light coming in.
It's well decorated and stylish. He also provides bicycles but we didn't have time to ride to the beach. Yes, it's pretty close to the beach.
For those that want a real cultural Chicago experience, this place is it. Book this place, you will probably want to move to Chicago.
Apparently, Teresa Knight place is popular with honeymooners and it is easy to see why. It is charming and feels like everything about the space has been done with thought and grace. I loved the cast iron tub in the bathroom, near the stand-alone shower, and the light from the discreetly placed windows.
We really appreciated their flexibility with check- inch and all the special touches that were included. You'll love it!
Staying here was like being at home. Marcos Blount’s house is beautiful and in a great location! Nearby you will find the RB Pier, restaurants, coffee shops and more.
This is one of those rare airbnb's that you don't want anyone else to know about! LOL. Great place, so clean, easy parking, the location was fabulous...the bikes, the outdoor seating, the quietness, the uber comfy bed, the amazing hot shower, etc.
Yummy coffee and ample dishes and supplies. !
He reviewed the check in procedures with us and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. You can expect a clean home with plenty of sleeping space, extra blanket , and towels. As a guest you have your own entrance, control of the thermostat, and a ton of storage.
We loved staying here! It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous.
Robert Turpen's topographical point if great. Heaven. Thanks Robert Turpen!
the stay in this house is awesome. Teresa Knight has one of the cleanest home I ever stayed at. It is a very short walk to the Redondo Beach Pier with some good seafood restaurants.
I loved the place, it was very bright clean as well as the shared bathroom. We barely met other guests of the house but when we did they were very nice as well as Elizabeth- she was very helpful and cared about our comfortness and about anything we had needed.
Clean bathroom/shower with water that stays hot. Wifi was consistent, No TV but we have a mini projector that we travel with...just for unwinding and watching a movie at the end of the night. There’s so many things to see and do or just relax so a TV isnt necessary!
Enjoyed my stay and would return. First time Airbnb'er here..  Neva's place was exactly what i was looking for.. Her place being a stand alone Casita is really nice, quiet and private as well.
We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, snacks, water, and a fridge. We enjoyed the view from the deck before we got dressed and headed to a lovely dinner at the Cliff House. We then came back to enjoy the view after dark and were able to watch some Richard Batton before heading to bed.
The space was super cute and also had everything you needed for an extended stay. Extremely clean and the host was very quick to respond/help with anything. The bikes they supplied were our favorite.
! In fact, the day my husband and I were due to arrive I notified the host that my husband was unable to come and that I was bringing another swim mom with me instead. The host graciously set up another futon bed in the studio (which had to be brought out of storage.).
Jeffrey’s home is quite stunning and located so centrally to so much! If you’re not into public transportation, the Uber rides to attractions/sites are all fairly inexpensive from Jeffrey’s home. The house is literally across the street from a market and Starbucks and right next to a parking lot, so we did not have maneuver San Francisco’s crazy parking zones.
There is a manual of 'rules' on the table and I was thinking that it was going to be one of 'those kind' but when I opened it - it really was a how-to guide on how to make yourself at home. So I did. I started to get nosy and open everything and got loads of brilliant surprises, all kind of games and fun things to find.
We appreciated a prompt communication in cases we had questions. The place is perfectly located  - max. 25 minutes Uber ride to JFK.
And little handwritten notes everywhere. After a day of driving, shlepping, packing/unpacking, cleaning, and generally helping my student move into or out of the dorm, what a joy it is to arrive at Susan and Khanh's home. Peaceful, spotless, welcoming, the music is softly playing and the stress is gone.
Maggie’s place is in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood, which is perfect for recharging after schlepping yourself around all day. The beds were soft, the shower was hot and we had all the comforts of home even though we were far from it. Additionally, Maggie is great about quick response and suggestions for what to do, while giving you your space.
We did not have our own vehicle. If you are not used to driving in hills, be advised that this area is quite hilly and the roads are narrow - so do take your time getting in and out of the neighborhood.
It really is spotless. Thanks for a cozy stay! I would stay here again for sure.
Angela's place somehow embodied stylish & at home all in one. Everything is white, which I loved because that makes it easy to tell how clean it is (no worries- her topographic point was immaculately clean). It was a 20 min drive to all the "touristy" things we wanted to do & a 5 min walk to the nearest bus stop.
Heather is a warm, thoughtful host who offers the visitor a clean and inviting apartment that stands out from the rest because it has a patio garden off the bedroom with beautiful flowers and trees. A small bistro table invites you to enjoy your morning coffee, while on the kitchen table a bottle of wine, some chocolate, and fresh cut flowers welcome your arrival. The apartment is comfortable, clean, and located right across the street from the ocean.
WOW! Hopefully, we will see you again soon.
How great is that?! Thanks, Susan!
The outdoor shower was a great extra feature— we were a little doubtful about showering in the chilly evenings, but the hot shower with surrounding fairy lights was HEAVENLY. Francis Jones was an amazing host and checked in with us during our stay. She was thoughtful and made sure every detail was perfect— leaving coffee beans and grinder for us, asking beforehand what kind of milk we use, leaving fresh robes for us to use for the outdoor shower.
Christina's topographic point is GREAT. The apartment is located very close to old Tacoma and while it is on a busy street, parking was ample and the location, tucked down away from the street, meant that there was no noticeable street noise. Everything about this stay was easy and pleasant and Christina was very responsive.
With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. Paul was extremely flexible in allowing us to book the night before to accommodate for our 6:30am flight arrival from Sydney so we could drop our bags, have a shower and settle in - he even left the lights on for us and gave us very straightforward check in instructions. He has some great tips for what to do around town, however a quick walk or bike ride up the beach will bring you to the great eateries of Redondo, Hermosa and Manhattan beaches.
Christiana’s Old Town Studio is wonderful. Christiana really goes the extra mile as a host. Along with fresh flowers, she left a basket of snacks (breakfast bars, cereal, oatmeal, chips and cookies), and a special dark chocolate orange treat.
This our go-to place for vacation! It’s always ridiculously clean and so comfortable, and Francis Jones and Tammy couldn’t be better hosts! Location is quiet both early in the day and at night, and so centrally located.
She is an exceeding decorator; the place exudes warmth and character. It is a great location close to the beach with easy parking. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to the pier.
Thank you so much for everything Maggie & Jon! Will definitely stay here again next time I’m in NYC! xo
You must go steep stairs but that's all right . Sassy the small dog of her is sooo cute. Very highly recommended! I have stayed in lots of Airbnb’s and this is one of the best.
There were bottles of water, juices, and yogurts in the fridge. Bathroom is super nice! The overall Airbnb is very spacious and very clean and has a cute flower garden out back!
Chuck's sense of humor is delightful and we truly loved our chats with him throughout our stay. Chuck’s beautiful home and landscape is only matched by his own wonderful personality, we decided that we will be staying here from here on out whenever we visit Norfolk so long as the space is available when we do visit. Most everything you can imagine is within a 15 minute drive with some great options for lunch/dinner at an even shorter distance.
We loved the modern design and really cool efficient use of space and the tranquil garden setting. This is a perfect hideaway with easy access to oakland and berkeley. Oh, and the bed was really comfortable - meant for sleeping in.
We briefly met Neva when arriving, she is friendly and nice. You really could walk to a lot of places or to anything you would need even a grocery store. Good food close by too.
We will definitely be back. Very clean, private quiet place minutes from the HB pier. Just a two minute walk to the beach and volleyball courts.
Michael was a great host with a lot of knowledge and unique insight to his city and recommendations during our short stay. The room was delightfully comfortable we almost missed walking around the city! :) I would not hesitate staying here again especially to see the outdoor patio all planted.
GREAT Tv. The bedroom is on the street side so u may hear cars but it is not like NYC with honking and screeching. I had no problem sleeping.
I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a wonderful respite from urban Berkeley. The cottage was so quaint and perfectly decorated, and there are some social pool who will chat with you in the garden if you like. I only wish we could have stayed longer.
Proctor Cottage is an excellent value and I highly recommend it. The host maintains a beautiful back yard (where the unit is located with direct access and parking from the alley) and was delightful and respectful. We are repeat visitors to Tacoma and will definitely try to book the Proctor Cottage again.
Welcome basket includes fresh squeezed orange juice, bread, delicious jam, etc. The house is very cute and thoughtfully decorated. The garden adjacent to the house is a nice surprise.
What more could you ask for. Our experience at Nina's is going to be hard for any other AirBNB host to beat! Thanks a million to Nina and Merv for a wonderful experience!
The perfekt Airbnb Experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We felt very comfortable with Angela. She really thought of everything, from slippers to breakfast in the fridge. And Angela was just adorable, warm and open.
BTW, although a batch of the restaurant were closed when we went out for dinner (Monday night), we fell in love with the patio area at Jupiter and their salad were amazing. Linda and Dan's cottage is the perfect place to relax after the hustle and bustle of a jam packed vacation. It was wonderful to have full privacy while maintaining precious views of the beauty of nature right outside the windows.
Marc's place is like everything you want from a boutique hotel with none of the bother of dealing with other guests or the awkward encounters that sometimes come with them. There's one short flight of stairs, so you've got to be okay with that, but the building has a kind of Baker Street charm and the location is great. About a 10 min walk from the BART and a short stroll to lots of neighborhood spots.
The loft was very cozy and comfy. It was very adorable. We arrived late driving down from Poulsbo after spending time with family on Easter.
Food around the neighbourhood was fantastic! You could easily get anything you wanted. We fell in love with this large supermarket across the apartment.
Dolores park is spectacular. Steps away. Also steps away was Linea Coffee.
You'll love it! Edwin Green’s place is so close to the Redondo Beach pier. We took our bikes and spent hours biking along the coast.
We were only a 5 minute walk away from the beach and just a hop away from a variety of great places to eat and drink. Chris & Tim made great recommendations for us and we are so appreciative of the attentiveness. They think of every little detail!
The bungalow was super cute, tiny but well furnished. Only two people stayed but could easily accommodate four . Location was perfect, super close to beach and restaurant .
Thank you Angela!! We loved staying at Angela’s place. It has a cosy, relaxing feel and only a few minutes from the beach.
We would definitely stay here again! the backyard is quiet, and lovely to sit outside at night. the space is roomy, clean, and welcoming.
Highly recommended! Extremely large room, clean, great condition and facilities. Elizabeth is very friendly, helpful and thoughtful .
We spent three nights here and our only complaint was we didn’t book it for longer. Very clean and quiet. I was visiting my daughter who goes to University of Puget Sound so this is about a 10 minute or less drive from her campus.
The proximity to the beach was amazing and we enjoyed the beach motorcycle ! Tiana could not have been better! She was so helpful and accommodating.
Matthew An's place is not fancy, but it was within cycling distance of the beach and restaurants, and she was friendly and helpful with dining suggestion . I saw Matthew An at checkin but got up early and left. The house was quiet.
Perfect Place to Stay! This lovely guest cottage was perfect, from the time we arrived with our two dog to the morning that we happily headed home. The cottage had the relaxed classy beach decor we were looking for, with a comfortable bed and a great shower.
The pool and hot tub were incredible and so relaxing and the dogs were very sweet. Cher Alexander was always available but giving us privacy. My husband enjoyed the few conversations he had with Robert Huckabaa husband.
There was a touchy gesture with welcome snacks and drinks in the refrigerator. There were all possible cosmetic skin  and hair caring products in the bathroom. The kitchen possessed all necessary items for preparing meals.
Convenient and delicious options so close to home. And you will feel at home there! The Pink Line is just a few blocks away and offers excellent access to the city so you can just park the car for your visit (plenty of street parking but be comfortable parallel-parking just in case needed).
Thanks again. Without a doubt one of the nicest Airbnb rooms I have ever stayed in. The room is large with a private balcony, walk-in closet, double sinks and marble vanity, sitting area and large screen TV.
Clean, well maintained, and very comfortable place to stay (with dedicated parking!). Great location. Private little apartment with outdoor lounge area access.
I was afraid it was too good to be true, but I assure you, it really is that amazing! We spent most of our days out exploring (spending a lot of time in the Mission district), but we were always excited to return to our room. The bed was very comfy, the amenities were perfect, and we really enjoyed the community space for winding down at the end of a long day.
Even though our stay was short, my new wife and I were extremely satisfied and delighted with our stay at Michael Krieg and Cher Alexander's home! Michael Krieg is a gracious host and has a lovely home to stay in, with a convenient location close to the sights around Gig Harbor. She has an eye for details and takes care of extra touches to insure that her guests are comfortable and pampered.
We got a wonderful nights sleep. Mona was so quick to respond and wonderful to talk to. Her restaurant/amenity suggestion list was really helpful.
Nina and Merv’s topographic point was absolutely fabulous! Upon our arrival we quickly noticed how the safe, quiet, and just beautiful the neighborhood was. The place itself was clean and they made certain we had plenty of towels, pillows, blanket , hangers, etc.
I don’t want to write a review because I don’t want to share this place with everyone, it’s an amazing spot. Ben and Jacqueline are amazing hosts, giving us tips on the area and San Fran, warned us about tolls, reservations needed for certain spots, and where the best people watching would be. I’d highly recommend seeing if they have an opening for you.
What a treat! Angela's bungalow is delightful. It is clean, cute, and well appointed!
Location-wise, it’s great. You can walk to the Mission (we did) or to the main strip of restaurants on Cortland in Bernal Heights. You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area.
I would have liked to stay for a week. Plenty of parking on a large cul de sac with no traffic.
It's well decorated and stylish. One more thing, the room has an Amazon echo dot called Alexa and I like it so much! I'm gonna buy one for myself.
Great stay! The house is very clean and organized. Joan Litwin was friendly and welcoming when we met her.
Fell asleep in an instant it was so comfy. Paul’s guest house is wonderful! Beautifully decorated and immaculately clean.
The space is clean and stylish! ).
Neva's place is perfect for those who want a good place to sleep that is close to LAX and events in LA. The room is small, but very comfortable, and the patio is a perfect place to sit and visit. We had our privacy with the advantage of being close to activities!
We really appreciated their flexibility with check-in and all the special touches that were included. You'll love it!
Don't think twice,  just BOOK IT. My husband and I whizzed all around the state of Washington and were happy to come "home" every night. We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the snacks Bob and Robert Huckabaa left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen.
Smaller space, but we still loved that it was very cozy and private for two people, especially just relaxing watching tv. We were even able to make use of the mini fridge and toaster oven as well. Sitting on the patio and enjoying the view made for a lovely last few minutes of our stay this morning!
This is a phenomenal place to stay. I’d highly recommend it to anyone who’s in town or just wants to a weekend to relax, plus you’re close to the beach
The apartment was very broad and tidy. There is a little kitchenette with a fridge, sink, and microwave. It was a nice surprise to see that the fridge was stocked with water, OJ, milk, and yogurt.
This was our first time booking an Airbnb and the bar is set really high for any future engagement anywhere else. The location is great. The loft is beautifully decorated, very cozy and very clean.
So we shortened our stay in San Fran. I live in SF and got this place for my parents when they were visiting. They absolutely loved it.
The cabin is small, but Miranda Malone has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay. Couldn’t have asked for a better Airbnb or a kinder host. Thanks again, Miranda Malone!
That’s rly sweet. There’s a few restaurants nearby which offers decent brunch & dinner. Am in love with the vintage store at telegaraph Ave (walkable distance) opposite aunt Mary’s restaurant.
Linda's place is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museums. The neighborhood was quiet and her house is lovely. Linda was very friendly but gave us total privacy.
Nala's place is a nice, cozy space. There is a bar below that can play music until 5am and some patrons that hang outside to smoke for a little. If you are a super light sleeper, this is not the place for you.
Entry is easy with coded lock - location is excellent, close to Dolores Park, BiRite market and Pizzeria Delfina and so many other great walkable places between the Mission and Castro. It's such a nice touch to have the coffee maker, kettle, and mini fridge. When people are traveling, we don't really get to bring home leftover from restaurants bcs there's nowhere to put them- so a mini fridge is such a nice touch.
Shelton Gill's place is ideal for folks wanting a quiet, peaceful place that is close to the beach. The public beach entrance feels very private and many times I had the beach to myself. The house is in an old neighborhood with lots of artsy homes and it felt very safe.
The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were lots of little extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of games for us to play after a long day on our feet. I was in town for the NeoCon Conference and the Coach House was the perfect escape from all the busy at the end of my photoshoot. I traveled with my mom and my kids and we were comfortable, delighted, and fell in love with the area.
Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city. Also very conveniently located across the street from a 7/11 that was either open very late or 24/7! We did not see Anne while we were there, however she was VERY quick to respond to any message I sent her and she was very friendly.
I had a place to park, easy to follow instructions on what to do at arrival, and all the necessities in the place. Elizabeth was the nicest hostess! I am going to recommend her to any friend or family member who is coming to visit the area.
We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the snacks Dennis Steward and Sharann left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen. We explored Mt. Rainier, Arnold Jackson and St. Helens and also spent a whole day in Seattle (even caught a Mariners game).
It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. delectable coffee and ample dishes and supplies. Thank you!!
Things like bathroom supplies, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips, bandaids, toothpaste or toothbrushs, etc. Not sure if the hosts leave their house whenever they have guests but you do have to enter the host’s main house in order to get to your place downstairs, so that’s a little weird. Overall, it was a great stay for a single night.
Scott’s place is super comfortable, clean, and friendly. He goes beyond the average with amenities. Feels like you have the whole place to yourself.
I'd definitely book again if traveling in the area. !
The location was perfect and the hosts were amazing. The cottage felt very private and yet we were close to a variety of things to do! We were only a 5 minute walk away from the beach and just a hop away from a variety of great topographic point to eat and drink.
Anytime I asked a question she got back to me right away! Very clean! Lots of closet space to hang coats and cardigans.
An awesome Airbnb experience....our stay at Edward Ramsey's place was great in every way. Very nice home in a great Queens neighborhood. Our friendly conversation with Edward Ramsey and May upon arrival set the tone.
The Neighborhood felt very safe and quiet. This tiny house was fantastic! Even driving up, it’s beauty hit us from the get go.
Great position of Oakland dock and a different view of San Francisco Bay including travelling under the Bay Bridge. Christian's Airbnb was GREAT! He was a 10-minute walk from the West Oakland Bart station (one stop to downtown SF!)
The space is clean, bright, and comfortable, with wonderful big windows that look out on the water. Marcia has thought of every detail, from chilled beverages in the fridge to an extra-soft blanket for snuggling on the couch. She's included restaurant recommendations (the takeout teriyaki we picked up was wonderful!)
 following time we're down in the area, we'll definitely be checking availability here. If my 6'2" husband had been along with me, it would have been a bit too tight. But that being said, the guest register reflected that many other couple had stayed there and were perfectly comfortable.
The loft is very close to business district and major sights with easy acces to public transportation system . Anyway, you won’t be disturbed in the loft - t’s quite and peaceful up here. The host is very nice and helpful.
Elizabeth’s home was warm, inviting, and so clean. Elizabeth's house was wonderful place to stay! The location is outstanding - good area, quite place, private parking and close all places of interests.
You really could walk to a lot of places or to anything you would need even a grocery store. Cal
We loved starting the day hanging out on the cute small porch swing, listening to the birds. That area really is the perfect place for a little retreat - so peaceful! Be sure to come here if you want to experience the quieter (better) side of Virginia Beach!
The beds were soft, the shower was hot and we had all the comforts of home even though we were far from it. All of this is for a antic price! If we come back, we will book with Maggie before looking anywhere else.
The only thing I would mention is not to bother buying your own guide book of San Francisco, there are loads in the apartment to use with local maps and Heathers own recommendations. Thank you letting us stay with you, it was perfect.
This place offers anything you might possibly need when traveling and many amenities. There are many particular touches which make you feel very much at home. The location is ideal and offers easy access to the beach, shopping, restaurant , and more.
This was the perfect place for us to stay in while in town for a family reunion. Esmie and her husband are perfect host and made us feel comfortable in their home. Although there were several other rented rooms downstairs, the house was quiet and our space felt private.
Lots of restaurants nearby. Basically it was like sharing his entire home. Scott's place is a great choice for a long or short stay in LA.
One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located. I sometimes felt like I wished I could lock the bathroom door for privacy- but it wasn’t that big of a deal. I would totally go back!
The hosts have also gone out of their way to provide local tourist information, some games and toys for children, and an assortment of DVDs. There is park with a brand new playground, with climbers, swings, and a zipline about two blocks away. Our son loved playing there.
The location is perfect - close to transit to get to “ touristed ” destinations, but there is lots to see and do in the local vicinity as well. Tyler’s place was spotless upon arrival and had everything we needed to enjoy eating in and cooking when we wanted to. We would definitely recommend Tyler’s place to friends and family and look forward to returning soon!
The experience here is truly seamless-- Tyler is immensely thoughtful, super responsive and considerate. I logged some hulu/netflix hours and loved the cozy bathrobes in the closet :) The bed is super comfortable, and there's every amenity you could think of. A fantastic alternative to overpriced/disappointing SF hotels for business travel.
She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. I actually work very close to Marcos Blount’s home so I am familiar with the area. So I can vouch for the restaurants like anchalee, cafe trieste, etc as very cunning and yummy places to eat!
Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! Immaculate home with a wide living room / kitchen area and a nice bedroom tucked in between. The home and garden were beautiful!
The Beach Cottage is the perfect place for a couple or family to stay. This location is close to everything and you're able to walk everywhere. This was my first experience with an Air bnb and it far exceeded my expectation .
Thank you, Scott. We chose Scott’s place because of the bikes he had available, and ended up loving everything about the place! Great location and amenities.
We wanted quiet and privacy, and this suits the bill perfectly. We did get a visit from his very sweet dog Olive, though, World Health Organization I'm certain was curious to see who was in the cottage for the weekend. She likes ear rubs.
Staying at John Brashier home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. We stayed at John Brashier place for two nights before leaving for two nights for a Yosemite tour and then coming back for another 4 nights. Miranda Malone was very accommodating and allowed us to store our luggage in his office and brought it down to the room on the day we returned.
Tyler provided us with all the space we required but was also available for any questions and tips as we needed them and after meeting him and his partner we feel like we now have a couple of new lifelong friends. Don’t stay anywhere else in ‘San Fran’ - just stay here, you won’t regret it.
The cottage is a cozy environment with a completely stocked kitchen; comfortable furniture; quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance to food, entertainment AND beautiful walking trails and the beach is one road crossing away! The hosts, Bennie Dudgeon and Shantell Preusser, do EVERYTHING they can to create the most welcoming experience. They provide particular treats when checking in (or back-in, in my case); they share some great tips on the amazing restaurants nearby; Shantell Preusser helped me navigate my first snow-driving experience with expert advise for a Californian with zero snow-driving experience!
Fell asleep in an instant it was so comfy. Both were within a short distance from the guest house and I highly recommend. Stop searching and book this place!
Neva is warm and welcoming, and meeting her sweet pup, Logan was an extra special treat! Loved it!
The place was extremely neat, with fresh towels and linen provided, along with all the bathroom essentials. Luis Hawkins was extremely responsive to my question and requests, and it was very easy to communicate. We had a wonderful experience at Luis Hawkins's place and I would recommend it to other travellers to SF.
There was a private bathroom for guests with toiletries. Barb showed us around the home and there is a code for the lock which made it very simple. Parking was right in front of the home and always for available.
What a great space, thoughtful touches with snacks, such comfortable sheet and comforters with many pillows. Everything was just as described. Quiet and a great set up for me, my 11 year old son and my sister as we explored New York City.
Angela’s place was exactly as-described, and exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for in an AirBnB for a first-time trip to San Francisco. It was just far enough away from the crazy city bustle to be able to relax when we wanted, but yet a 5-minute walk to shops and some seriously awesome food right in Bernal (GO TO TAQUERIA CANCUN), as well as a quick (~15 min) Uber/Lyft ride away from everything we wanted to do in the city (we could go out and do things in the city and come back to change/relax/drop things off multiple times per day without wasting much time). The place itself was very clean, and had some really nice amenities, such as a great shower, good size fridge, comfortable bed, and ever-important coffee.
The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra warmth. And the breakfast room and attached balcony are cheery , with Traci's homemade muffins, quiche, eggs, fruit.
My daughters played pool, on the Wii, did homework on the computer and we had fun listening to music on the record player provided! Brian and Hillary are so responsive and kind and make checking in and out so very easy. We look forward to staying again in 2019!
The location of the guest house was super close to both Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, as well as a nearby strip mall with Whole Foods and Paris Baguette. Angela was super apologetic about the light construction happening next door, but there's nothing she could have done about that. It didn't really bother us in the least.
It felt very secluded and quiet, but was just ~15 minutes driving from downtown Vashon. It was a nice walk down the rocky beach to the lighthouse. It would be absolutely perfect for a romantic couple of days with a loved one...winter (drinking hot drinks, watching the storms over the water) or Gregory Simons (enjoying the sunshine, walking on the beach).
That brings me to my 2nd point - the amenities at Scott’s were fantastic! Nice pool table, beautiful clean bathroom with lux feeling shower, the amazon echo was more helpful than I thought it would be and having access to a bike + all the beach gear (towels, beach chairs, etc) was an extra bonus. Finally regarding the location you cant beat it.
It’s always nice to have linens & towels provided as well! I would definitely stay here on any future visits & would recommend it for couples, families, or groups of friends!
Scott also provided snacks in the room and lots of toiletry items in the bathroom--even sunscreen which we shoulda used. Ha. The bed slept GREAT, Scott was kind enough to allow us to use his beach chairs and laundry facilities which was very helpful and convenient.
We were blown away with how comfortable we felt staying here! The loft was a perfect size for two, with great amenities in the kitchen, a  cozy living space with an electric fireplace under the TV, an awesome shower, and the most comfortable bed I’ve probably ever slept in. My boyfriend and I had zero complaints about staying here and were sad to leave!
We especially appreciated using the bikes to ride along the beach in the morning. Check in instruction manual were very clear and precise. The place was very clean and comfortable.
An easy 2 block walk to a great, family friendly beach area. Games in room for families, a few waters, soft drinks and snacks also provided. We felt welcomed.
We had no problem with this. If you do not have a car, San Francisco is hilly and the neighbourhood here is no exception.
What a great stay. Ben and Michael's topographic point is so pretty and clean and comfortable. We love old houses and it was a great quaint bungalow.
Amazing beach cottage! Cottage has everything you need, bed is very comfortable and shower is awesome! The hosts have done a great job creating a beautiful guest cottage, we loved our time there and wish we could’ve stayed longer!
They also allowed us to stay late on our last day due to our flight. Tammy and Marc’s place is perfect. The location can’t be beat (especially for the price.)
Thanks again Joan Litwin and Hillary for making our "stay-cation" so comfortable and memorable. A very warm welcome and very inviting and alone space. Friendly notes around the space helped with any questions we had and a binder gave more detailed information plus tip on where to go and places to eat.
The place itself was quiet and spacious, with a private entrance and great natural lighting. The shower was hot and we appreciated the tea and coffee in the morning. Check-in was easy using a keypad; however I did have to reach out first on the day of arrival to get the check in information.
Alejandrina Anderson provides a very comfortable and relaxing space. I highly recommend a stay at her place. So many thoughtful amenities were provided and the bed was divine.
Happily, we were more focused on spending time to catch up since my son and I are on opposite coasts, and hanging at the loft provided us that...even though our pool skills could use some work! This loft was bigger and better than I even imagined! The twinkling lights and thoughtful decor made the huge space seem cozy and inviting, and there was plenty of space to spread out and relax.
Extremely courteous! I HIGHLY recommend Paul’s place.
Neva's place was great! Clean, comfortable and great location! I appreciated the amenities she left for us (snacks, water, soap, lotion, tooth brushes, etc.)
It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. !
Great views of Oakland docks and a different view of San Francisco Bay including travelling under the Bay Bridge. You can catch any train into San Francisco. I would recommend anyone looking for a warm and friendly household must stay at Christain and Jackie’s.
When we first got there, we found post-it notes all around the place with instructions that made it easy to settle in. She provided us with breakfast (yogurt and granola), tea, coffee and fruit ! A really nice touch.
My father was so satisfied that while staying there he booked another trip to stay at the cottage for 7 nights. Greg Jr.
She offered us bikes to browse the neighborhood  The place is amazing and would fit two ppl perfectly. Bathroom is so elegant  There is kitchen with coffee maker and many coffee options.. There's a backyard with lovely sit of chairs and fireplace..
I would absolutely recommend these quarters! Great for a weekend getaway!
We had a great night's sleep and was impressed with the high quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the bathtub. Zeena checked in with us regularly and always asked if we needed anything else, definitely going above and beyond. Even though our stay was short, my new wife and I were extremely satisfied and delighted with our stay at Zeena and Lori Stewart's home!
And by the manner those new 4 recently refurbished rooms are so beautiful with individual bathroom ; high ceilings and have an early 20th century style . We did enjoyed your company . See you again,,,
 cardinal location makes anything you need an Uber ride/Bart/walk away. I got to fall in love w Oakland. Will definitely be back!
Chris and Shelton Gill were wonderful!! The bungalow was very clean, with all the amenities you would need for an enjoyable stay. It is close to Shore Drive, but yet seems very private, thanks to a beautiful garden area.
I had a great stay at Peg and Jeff’s place! The place itself is also very spacious with a great back patio and beautiful high ceilings and skylights! Would definitely stay again!
There was good communication with Jeni when we were delayed five hours, The cottage was warm clean and welcoming. The cottage was quiet, and there was plentiful information about how everything worked, and about restaurants and places to go in the neighborhood. Thank you Jeni and Michelle, we'll certainly have you at the top of our list when we're back in Tacoma again
Her place was sparkling clean, comfortable and the décor was spot on. We enjoyed our morning conversations over coffee with Linda in the common area. What a great place to stay if you get a chance to book it.
I left her house each day and walked to all my destinations (although ambitious, it can totally be done from this location). She was friendly and went the extra mile to make sure all the technicality were in place, and I found the small bed to be comfortable because I slept like a rock! Would totally recommend.
Fresh duck eggs from the backyard ducks were amazing and so nice and generous of her to share! It was also cool to see all her cooking and fermentation projects going on in the kitchen, as someone who is also passionate about that stuff it was fun to stay with someone else who loves to cook. Location is great if you have a car.
We have had an incredible trip! The location couldn’t have been better as we were just a few steps from public transportation and a market for groceries was right at the corner. Even when we came inside to escape the rain, we had a spectacular view of the city.
I typically stay in the same hotel each time I visit the East Bay for work. The scene was picturesque (imagine lemon trees, tropical flowers and humming bird each morning). The actual guest room is even better in person than the beautiful movie online.
The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. We didn't use the living room too much but the seats looked very nice. The floors were clean enough that I walked around barefoot without an issue.
Neva's studio was perfect. We also enjoyed our walk to Hermosa Beach (about one hour leisurely walk for roundtrip) and drinking coffee in the backyard. Easy check-in and check out process!
She made sure everything was in its place for us—she really wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. I really wish that I could have stayed here longer, better yet live in a home exactly like hers (that’s how much i love it!!!) I recommend Betty Maust’s home and cordial reception a million times over!
Speakingof bikes, they are a great amenity. With dedicated bike lane , it is easy and fun. Christine's dining recommendations were spot on.
He was super friendly and sweet. Francis Jones and her family was very welcoming and friendly with their hospitality. Location is in a very safe quite neighbourhood.
I am relatively small so the topographic point was fine for me but person larger/taller may have some issues with the house as it is pretty compact. Otherwise Neva was awesome and I'd definitely recommend the place!
The description of the apartment is very accurate and in the folder he has prepared, you can find any information you need about the apartment but also the neighborhood and useful tips for San Francisco. Parking for the night is also relatively easy to find in the adjacent streets. We are happy to recommend Tyler’s apartment.
Parking was right in front of the home and always for available. The location is perfect if you want to stay out of Seattle. It is quiet and clean.
The bathroom and bedroom space were extremely clean and had everything we could have needed (anything from coffee, excess beach towels, sunblock, bottle opener, etc.). !
This was our first bnb experience and I only hope all are as nice! First off she is very easy to communicate with from the initial request to the day you leave. Since we had never been to a bnb we had many questions and she was very knowing .
Robert Huckabaa apartment is a beautiful find in San Francisco with a really wonderful host! Leo was highly responsive, very easy to interact with and left us all the information we needed in advance so we didn’t have to worry or pester about anything. The apartment itself is clean, well furnished (loved having a hair dryer and iron readily available!)
Katherine's place is ideal for folks wanting a quiet, peaceful place that is close to the beach. The public beach entrance feels very private and many times I had the beach to myself. The house is in an old neighborhood with lots of artsy homes and it felt very safe.
2 blocks away. You can go to the Golden State Park walking. Beautiful place to hang around and spend the day.
We appreciated our host’s friendliness and he has an adorable puppy who is friendly and sweet  (the puppy is active at times so sometimes we could hear her playing about upstairs!). We loved our time in Chicago and truly enjoyed our time at Joshua’s air bnb!! Thank you Joshua!
I plan to make this my go-to when coming back to the area, and wouldn’t hesitate to book again. The experience was great and the host is awesome! Bennie Dudgeon was quick to respond and a great host.
Highly recommend! This little studio is beautifully decorated, very clean, many thoughtful touches, at a professional level  B and B! The picture doesn’t do it justice!
Paul was very welcoming and accommodating during our visit. He allowed us to check in a bit earlier than expected due to our flight coming in a bit earlier and personally walked us through the place and all the aspects of it. He left a ha du guide for us to follow of the local places to visit.
We wanted quiet and privacy, and this suits the bill perfectly. :-)    All in all, it's a lovely place to get away from the city and just get some peaceful downtime. Recommended!
The washer/dryer hook up is handy for cleaning your clothes. We arrived in Oakland about 2 hours earlier than planned & she was so flexible as she wanted to greet us when we arrived. Once we arrived she personally gave us a tour/rundown of the Airbnb & made sure that we knew how to use the security system.
He even has a shampoo/conditioner/body wash console in the shower. You can't go wrong by staying here! 2 blocks from the beach :)
Although I didn’t actually get to meet her, I had a great time and had no problem getting into the house with her instructions. Thanks for having me, Elizabeth.
We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities.
We went to the beach the night we arrived, which was just a short little drive, no more than 15 minutes with traffic. There is a microwave, standard coffeemaker and mini fridge in the space if you them but there were also several dining options nearby. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Mona's place again!
Miranda Malone’s place provides not only a reasonably priced stay, but in addition, a lovely patio, a place to store & heat food, a fireplace (my personal favorite! It is nice to know that you are taken care of while at their place. It truly felt like a home away from home.
House is a five minute walk to beach but also situated in a quiet cul de sac, aside a pond. Lots of options are nearby, which you'll enjoy biking to. Strongly recommend.
It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment. It was perfect for a winter visit to Chicago with the amazing fireplace and heated floors.
This place was perfect and priced extremely well! I have a raptor truck and it fit in the provided parking spot! !
Arnold Jackson is such an outstanding host, paying attention to details and going above and beyond. For example, there was a freak power outage in the area when I arrived. Arnold Jackson had put out lots of candles to light the place up, making it even cozier.
The stay here was amazing! it exceeded our expectation , there's nothing bad to say about this place. Bennie Dudgeon was really good at answering our question and giving us advice of places near by.
The outdoor shower was a great extra feature— we were a little doubtful about showering in the chilly evenings, but the hot shower with surrounding fairy lights was HEAVENLY. Erica was an amazing host and checked in with us during our stay. She was thoughtful and made sure every detail was perfect— leaving coffee beans and grinder for us, asking beforehand what kind of milk we use, leaving fresh robes for us to use for the outdoor shower.
They were even nice enough to let us drop off our bags hours before check in time. We had an amazing time and would definitely stay there again if we are ever back in NY. We highly recommend for anyone to stay here!
Chip communicated quickly and easily and made our stay in Vashon a stress free one. The house catered to a restful and freeing weekend. I highly recommend dipping your foot in the water it'll definitely wake you up.
We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book Mona's place again! We were greeted upon arrival, even with our late check in. We were walked up to our secluded getaway, where we were told to ask for anything.
Kitchen with all the basic requirements. I would 100% use her apartment if I returned to San Francisco again. Other useful  info for guests:   Street parking right outside, free and plenty - unavailable for certain hours in the week due to street cleaning, check beforehand.
The neighborhood is beautiful. And, when I find free time I like to head out for a walk to look at the beautiful houses or shop at some of the quaint boutiques in the Proctor District. I've already planned my return visit to the Charming Proctor Suite in 2020!
Also the ceilings above bed are low/vaulted so even at 5’3” it was a bit annoying to get in and out of bed. And everything is right at your fingertips!
This was my first Airbnb experience ever, so I was not certain what to expect. Marcos Blount was welcoming, thorough in her instructions, and made our stay better than I could have imagined! The room was impeccably clean, spacious, quiet, and VERY comfortable, with beautiful linen and decor.
The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. The place was also spotless! I usually do a wipe down of any hotel we book and I didn’t need to here.
Tammy is a wonderful host, it was really easy to communicate with her and she is really nice. I hope I will have the oportunity to come back again with more time. I had a wonderful stay!
T’s beach bungalow was my first airbnb experience and it was amazing! I didnt cook since I was in town for a wedding, but I was still appreciative of the attention to detail. Third, check in/check out was easy: great communication and easy to follow instructions.
He was very generous in his offer to let us keep our belongings with him for safekeeping while we explored the area for the day, well past our checkout time. I’ll consider this my little Pied-à-terre from now on, and can’t thank the host(s) enough for their kindness and hospitality! It checks all the boxes and then some.
Set in a great little area - easy to get down to the bay and some really great local food place (we particularly enjoyed Matthew An’s sushi tip!) Our favourite Air B and bacillus to date!
Loved the bungalow and hanging out on the patio with the candles, tropical landscape, twinkle lights and iced cold beer. Very cool vibe and her dog Bailey is adorable. What more can you ask?
Would totally recommend. The area around the location has many restaurants and is safe. Public transport to downtown (MUNI) and airport (BART) is reachable with a short walk.
Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach. I'd 100% recommend spending your time at Virginia Beach / Norfolk at Shantell Preusser's.
Tiana was very prompt in responding to my texts and Derek was very kind to fill up air on the cruiser bikes that my brother and I thoroughly enjoyed! The best part: I was able to bring my dogs! So close to the beach and a taco shop!
With dedicated bike lanes, it is easy and fun. She put a lot of thought into finding quality eateries.. everything from coffee shops and greasy spoons, to seafood and Mexican. Added bonus.. almost every place is within walking distance.
Thank you is not enough Gloria! I have been traveling to Tacoma frequently for work and during a recent trip I stayed at Gloria's loft--it was without doubt my most enjoyable stay in Tacoma so far. The property is in the Theater District and there are a decent number of places close by for dinner/lunch/drinks.
Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. Loved the location in Oakland as well. Very easy to get to downtown Oakland or San Francisco.
The bungalow is wonderfully located a few blocks from the beach and close to shops, restaurants, and groceries. It was very convenient for me to get around the south bay. It is about a fast 10-15 minute drive to LAX, but beware of internal airport congestion once inside the airport.
Louise was such a wonderful host - even though we only crossed paths in person once, her warmth showed through all of her communications with me. This was a lovely, relaxing place to spend a few nights. The outdoor shower was fantastic - I now think all showers should include blue sky, birds chirping, and live plants!
Very cool vibe and her dog Bailey is adorable. We would definitely stay again.
The patio garden is very pretty and Mia was so adorable and calm. She also gave us a crib for my baby. As a former resident from the east bay, the location is just perfect—lots of shops and restaurants on the main street, nice and safe neighborhood,  close to SF, near berkeley,  also close to korean restaurants.
They had banana bread sitting on the counter when we arrived (which may have been the best banana bread I've ever had in my life). They also have the coolest book where you can take a photo of yourself and write about your travels - so it was really neat to look through it and see all of the people who had stayed with them before us. Their property is located super close (like, 2 miles) to a great downtown-ish area with a theater, restaurants, and an awesome bookstore.
Clifford Winkler is an absolutely wonderful host; his work and art literature can be found spread all over the studio, it is quite inspiring. For those that want a real cultural Chicago experience, this place is it. I am already booking my following trip and staying here.
Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay. Tyler has clearly put a lot of effort into ensuring his place feels like a hotel, but to be honest it didn’t feel like a hotel, it felt so much better - a home. Tyler provided us with all the space we required but was also available for any questions and tips as we needed them and after meeting him and his partner we feel like we now have a couple of new lifelong friends.
Angela is a great host. Welcome basket includes fresh squeezed orange juice, bread, delicious jam, etc. Angela has always been responsive.
The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a motorcycle shop close by called Switching Gears. Also, there is a quaint coffee shop and a beautiful preserve a few blocks away. We had a great time!
The room is huge, with a very large comfortable bed and great amenities. When someone says "My house is your house" very rarely is it true, but it certainly was during our stay at John Brashier. The room was ready ahead of time, she pleasantly greeted me and my partner.
This suite has the home away from home feel, with some added luxury. We will be staying with Brian Burns again should we come back to San Francisco.
It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc!
Tyler was so incredibly helpful and quick to respond. His place was the perfect spot for me and my husband. It’s exactly as pictured which was a huge plus!
We were so lucky to find this cozy Airbnb. They placed comprehensive and stylish signage (and a cute book!!) around the space that took care of any questions we might have had.
are reconsideration in many Airbnb’s. We had a really great stay! The place is broad and well-appointed and had everything we needed for our family of three.
Linda's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit eccentric, quiet, & "comfy". I think my best endorsement that I can say about it is that I would happily live here! Linda is a lovely person, and her puppy is brilliant!
Michael's place is one in a million! If you're on the fence, I highly recommend you make the booking - you won't regret it. The house is even better than the pictures show, and the rooftop deck is out of this world.
Yet for all you gain from a home stay sometimes you sacrifice a little of the crisp cleanliness and amenities of a professional environment. Not so at Tyler's spot! Not only was it lovely to be in a home in a neighborhood, but the room was like a lux hotel suite!
It has absolutely the best accommodation for sleeping plus one besides yourself. So very accessible into the city...  And a hop on the LIE for a drive to Long Island. I can see how parking could be tough but it really isn't (Website hidden by Airbnb) also scored a spot right in front ;)  The snacks and coffee provided made me feel right at home and came in handy for my late arrival to have a little something before going to bed and getting up early the next day for a packed schedule.
It is close to Shore Drive, but yet seems very private, thanks to a beautiful garden area. There is even an outdoor shower and all sorts of beach items for guests to use. If we needed anything extra during our stay, we could just ask.
Janet Luckman is a wonderful host, it was really easy to communicate with her and she is really nice. I hope I will have the oportunity to come back again with more time. I had a fantastic stay!
Their topographic point was spotless and so very comfortable. My husband wants me to ask them the trade name of comforter on the bed, he loved it very much.
Apartment is beautifully decorated and such a beautiful patio. As a smuggler I enjoyed having the running/walking path that runs parallel to the ocean. And I would recommend the Java Beach Cafe for breakfast.
Maggie and John were amazing hosts. The space is gorgeous and very clean. They were even nice enough to let us drop off our bags hours before check in time.
Dennis Steward's guesthouse is clean, quiet, safe, and in a great location. Dennis Steward greeted us immediately upon arrival and was extremely hospitable. The bed is comfortable, bathroom is great including the shower!
Yet, they were all still close enough to walk to and enjoy. Kelly also left us with recommendations which was probably my favorite part because the ones we checked out were awesome!
The hosts have also gone out of their way to provide local tourist information, some games and toys for children, and an assortment of DVDs. Grocery stores, restaurants, and coffee shops are also only a few blocks away. It is about a 10 minute drive to central Tacoma and 15 minutes to downtown.
It feels better than most hotels. The ocean view is unforgettable! Jennifer Merry is an amazing host and we will be certain to stay here in the future.
This suites location gives you a feel of what living in the city is like. Kelly is very easy to get ahold of if you need her,  and has great recommendation of things to do or food to eat around town. This suite has the home away from home feel, with some added luxury.
Streetside parking was available too. I enjoyed the themed Beach Room with comfy bed linens and a view of Mt. Ranier ( in the distance).
Thanks, Paul! !
Also, the bathroom is probably the nicest part of the place. When you see the shower, it is impeccable and very cool to use. The lighting in the entire place is really nice and romantic.
What a lovely experience at Robert Huckabaa and Colleen's place! It was truly an oasis and exactly what we had searched for - a local getaway that made us feel like we were in the center of nowhere without having to drive for hours out of Oakland.
We arrived to a fresh baguette on the counter and milk in the fridge for our coffee. We had such a lovely stay and would love to come back.
Nina’s tiny home is making me re-evaluate my life choices. Maybe I need to downsize my large 4-bedroom home, into a tiny home? I love how spacious everything is, and how comfortable and modern the loft and bathrooms are inside.
The entrance path and outside sitting area surrounded by tall bamboos added to the charm. This is a place I would return to in a minute.
Ewa was kind enough to refund the second night even though I let her know it wasn’t necessary. I would definitely stay here again.
The cottage is also super affordable, we paid half the cost of what a hotel was charging us in the area and got so much more. I will definitely be coming back to stay here in the near future. We also recommended the Cottage to our other family members that are coming to visit soon.
Miranda Malone! It's a wonderful experience,We didn't arrive at geroge's house until 4 o 'clock in the morning due to the flight delay. Unexpectedly, geroge was waiting for us all the time without sleeping.
The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Aaron’s place and convenient! When you get into the hotel, I’d recommend checking out all of the extra amenities offered such as the pool and especially the rooftop deck. The bedroom was very nice and the kitchen, and living room as well but my favorite thing about the place was the bathroom (specifically how comfortable the shower is).
I cannot rave about this place enough. So well equipped with everything you could ever need. Danielle has a very charming place with thoughtful touches all around.
As soon as you walk in, you'll see how spacious the room is and how tall the ceilings are. You can tell that this property has been renovated with many beautiful and modern touches. The bed is very comfortable and just right on the firmness.
Such a great stay at Tiana's cottage! It is perfectly clean, comfortable, and walking distance to the beach. Everything we needed for the beach was thoughtfully provided, chairs, towels, cooler bags, making the daily trips a breeze.
Redondo is a safe, quiet and clean little community with a great beach and pier, that's about a 30-45 minute drive from everything in the greater LA area. The El Burrito Jr. food stand just down the alley had some of the best Mexican food we've ever had, and the Donut shop across the street had donuts to die for! As a host, Tiana is second to none.
Most everything you can imagine is within a 15 minute drive with some great options for lunch/dinner at an even short distance. We were mostly decided on where to eat one day for lunch, but Shantell Preusser suggested this place specifically and we switched it up - gratuitous to say it was great. The home is photo-worthy and the landscape is worthy of the imagination of painters.
Very clean and comfortable updated bathroom and bedroom. Hermosa Beach is the best beach in Southern California and if you are looking for a small beach town, village feel, this is for you. The hosts are amazing and provide everything needed, including motorcycle , boogie boards, beach chairs and towels.
! Wonderful stay! We had an excellent time and would absolutely stay here again!
Everything was so nice---easy to locate, good parking, immaculately clean, great snacks and breakfast foods, beds were very comfortable with great bedding. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated and Susan left little notes everywhere explaining everything from where the extra toilet paper was to whether or not the fruit was washed and how to use the TV remotes and Wi-Fi. She had snacks for us and a great breakfast.
She rearranged her agenda to be home for our midday arrival. Her place was super easy to find from LAX, and we loved being able to walk to the beach. She was very helpful rhenium : places to eat, also.
Everything was found just as described. Very recommendable.
The bed was comfortable; there is a couch, a coffee table, and a small library of books. Mishaa & Denise put fresh coffee, biscuits and water out for when I arrived, which made it feel very homely. The bathroom is a short walk across the pathway, inside the pottery studio.
Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. Loved the art and pictures. Loved drinking my coffee with the humming birds and watching the boats on the water.
If you're looking for a spot to stay, there's a reason this is Airbnb is a plus location and we'll gladly vouch for our experience. Tyler is an excellent host. He worked hard to make sure April and I had everything that we needed, which exceeded our expectations.
I would definitely come back to this place, the location was great in Redondo Beach, and it was great for me and my family. First class, thanks for your great hospitality! Will be back.
We had so much fun at Paul’s place! We would absolutely stay again!
! This is an amazing little place very close to the campus of the University of Puget Sound. The check-in process is a breeze and communication with the host is outstanding.
And fun to look around at the art they are creating in the space when its not being rented to outside folks. Easy access to the highway was convenient and worked well for us. Our only wish, was that it was in a location that had some more food/drink options and more foot traffic to feel safer.
The bathrobes and slippers they provide are also a nice touch! I would definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in town!
Otherwise, you will surely be delighted by the experience and by Tyler’s detailed and generous hospitality. Staying at Tyler’s place was amazing ! It’s the best Airbnb we have had in these 21 days in America.
We stayed in her cottage for 6 days in late-December. We selected Betty Maust’s bungalow because it was located just a block my son and his family. Betty Maust was the perfect host, and she provided us everything we needed to stay comfortable, dry (thank you for the excess umbrellas!
Angela is the greatest host! We got there and she greeted us with treats and tips for our trip. Every recommendation was spot on and she was beyond hospitable.
Closet space is amazing! And, even though the area is very busy with traffic, it's a very quiet corner. I'd stay there again, for certain !
Maggie's townhome consists of renovated "apartments"- ours had two bedroom , a bathroom, and a small kitchenette and dining area. The place was very clean and comfortable...we couldn't recommend it more! Thank you, Maggie!
Gorgeous stay. Stephane’s place is an adorable, very well decorated & clean basement suite in a very nice part of Tacoma, equip with all you need including A/C! As first time visitors to Tacoma it was the perfect place for a girl weekend!
The space is exactly as described. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air.
Fell asleep in an instant it was so comfortable . John Brashier’s guest house is wonderful! Beautifully decorated and immaculately clean.
The mattress is very comfy, very firm (slept well even though I usually prefer a softer mattress) as is the rest of the room. Easy check in/out. Even a bidet toilet seat in the bathroom that I wasn't quite adventurous enough to try ha ha.
There is a cute backyard and our preschool son loved roasting marshmallow in the fire pit! We booked 1 week and had no issues, communication was excellent (Michael Krieg is very friendly and cheerful. He was always available when needed).
The breakfast items that were available to us, plus the bottled water, were very much appreciated. I hope to stay at Chris's place when I am next in SF.
We had a great stay and with the beach so close we rode there every day with the beach cruisers Robert Turpen provided. There is a parking space provided right in front of the house. Robert Turpen is a very warm and responsive host and added little touch to make us feel welcomed and at home.
The washer and dryer was super helpful given we stayed for a week. Ken was very responsive to any questions and inquiries, as well as helpful! The beds are very comfortable and the space was pretty quiet especially given such a central location.
Thank you, Chuck and Charlotte, for providing your amazing home as a wedding venue. My family stayed at Chuck's spacious and funky home, Wiseacre, during my daughter's graduation weekend from Old Dominion University. This mid-century modern gem and its gorgeous property provided the perfect setting for a post-graduation dinner which we hosted for family and friends.
I feel at home for sure. I also woke up late on my check out time and she was so understanding and flexible. The lone thing is, I didn’t meet the dog lol I was waiting for the dog to greet us hahah, but maybe next time.
Thank you Betty Maust! We really enjoyed our stay. The topographic point was beautiful and very clean.
We were here on a very hot week! Couldn’t tell that from inside the house, central air kept us nice and cool. Outside was brutal!
Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. Check- inch was incredibly smooth as well as check out. Everything is just very smooth and laid out for the guest.
I think) .. Christine had chairs, umbrellas, beach towels and blankets we were able to bring to the beach with us. We appreciated everything about our stay. If we make our way back down to Virginia Beach, Christine’s place will be the first place we look up.
The bungalow was super cute, tiny but well furnished. Only one parking space, hard to find parking if more than one car. Recommend small car for the free parking spot.
This was definitely the nice Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! I couldn’t recommend it more highly!
Thank you! This our go-to place for vacation! The location cannot be beat, and the room is just so perfect for everything one could need.
Their home is attractive and tranquil, with a lovely garden in back. I was pleased with my bedroom and bathroom. Both spaces were immaculate and well- stocked.
My wife and I just got married and spent a few days in Chicago and we were glad to stay here for our mini-moon. My lone hesitation would be that it's pretty far from downtown around 30 minutes away and the bus in front took long but Uber was very easy and not as expensive as we thought it would be. We're planning to go to Chicago again and we will definitely hit up this place again when we do!
Also worth mentioning is the access to a washer and dryer - when you’re away from home for almost 2 week , it’s beyond helpful to be able to have a chance to do some laundry and have more clean clothes. When traveling I prefer Air BNB to hotels. Yet for all you gain from a home stay sometimes you sacrifice a little of the crisp cleanliness and amenities of a professional environment.
We did however make good use of the beach chairs, which we very much appreciated! We truly hope we find our way back to Redondo and are able to stay in this beautiful guest house again, hopefully for a little longer following time!
The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Miranda Malone provides earplugs for light sleepers.
Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! Immaculate home with a spacious living room / kitchen area and a nice bedroom tucked in between. The home and garden were beautiful!
Tyler was very accommodating and allowed us to store our luggage in his office and brought it down to the room on the day we returned. The place was absolutely beautiful with stunning views. Do expect to walk up a slope and climb stairs to get to the entrance and another flight to the room.
The house is well decorated and close to JF Kennedy airport, just 20 min drive. Free parking is available by roadside nearby. We had a room upstairs with a cute loft, which is especially great for a family with kid, though we didn’t use it.
The house is in a quite neighborhood. With the nice breeze and orange flower smell, we slept like a baby every night. You also can not beat the location, the beach is less than half mile, tons of restaurant within walking distance.
The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s business district as well — just something to keep in mind. Heather and JP are fantastic hosts!! Their space is incredibly stylish and really unique.
We had a great stay and with the beach so close we rode there every day with the beach cruisers Angela provided. There is a parking space provided right in front of the house. Angela is a very warm and responsive host and added little touches to make us feel welcomed and at home.
Scott's house has a lot of his personal touches to it and it reflects well onto you when you are inside with his colors and arts. Really conveniently located with an easy drive to the LAX airport.
Heather's cozy cottage looks exactly like the pictures and the description. It is an easy walk to stores, including grocery stores, and the bus line and is in a safe and clean neighborhood. Bus #2 on 19th will take you directly to downtown Tacoma to visit museums and the Tacoma Dome.
Arthur Paddick and Robert Turpen were fantastic hosts right from when we booked several months ago. There are motion detector lights at front door and at top of stairs, which makes it feel safe and also very functional. The house is beautiful and the immediate neighbourhood is safe and clean, but unfortunately you don't have to travel far to find a lot of litter, vagrants and discomfort.
It was a bit on the pricier side but that was because it had all of the amenities of being in a hotel. We had brought chargers for our phones, but those were also provided right beside the bed. The room also had an apple TV that was great for kicking back and watching something while watching dinner.
This is a fantastic little find on a quiet street, just a few steps from the sand, but within easy walking distance of the bars and restaurants of Hermosa and Redondo. The bed was wonderfully comfortable, full cable television and a large and well-equipped bathroom. Would definitely try to book again if I wanted to go back to Hermosa.
Nala's place is a nice, cozy space. It is super close to public transportation, a post office, salons, a boutique, some tasty eateries and murals. It is about a 30 minute ride on the train to the city center, which isn't bad at all.
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. She was even willing to work with our scheduling as my boyfriend's flight got delayed by a blizzard . 12 out of 10.
Great location and close to the beach. Elizabeth is very nice and accommodating. I would highly recommend her place for short or long term stays.
I have had the pleasure of staying here multiple times and always have had my expectation met. I’ve always stayed multiple nights but even  just an overnight would feel particular too!
Super convenient. We felt more than safe coming in and out of Cher Alexander coach house and felt safe knowing they were close by. We often find ourselves renting from hosts who own multiple properties and we rarely hear from them so I really loved that we were all on the same property as Janet Luckman and Curt.
Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! She provides a stocked fridge with yogurt, juice, milk, granola, tea, water, fruit, etc. This made our mornings super easy to get in a quick bite and hit the road.
:) The morning light is wonderful and I absolutely loved being able to make breakfast in the extremely well appointed real cook’s kitchen. The knives were nice and sharp, there was plenty of olive oil for making eggs, the counters and fridge were sparkling clean and I always appreciate a gas stove!
Michael and Ben were fantastic hosts right from when we booked several months ago. There are motion sensor lights at front door and at top of stairs, which makes it feel safe and also very functional. The house is beautiful and the immediate neighbourhood is safe and clean, but unfortunately you don't have to travel far to find a lot of litter, vagrants and discomfort.
The apartment is spotlessly clean, homely and has everything you need to relax and enjoy your break. Heather is a great host and has lots of information / guide books plus personal tips to suggest if you need help. The apartment is 5 minute walk to the train which takes you directly into the city and they run every 10 minutes.
This suite was..  sweet! The topographic point was just lovely! Probably my best experience yet.
Tammy and Marc have truly thought of every detail to make it a comfortable stay. Walking distance to restaurants and shops and only 1 block from the beach! Would definitely recommend for a restful beach getaway.
It was clean, spacious and was safe for a single person's stay. I would recommend to friends, family and people reading this to stay at Elizabeth's for a cost effective, fun, safe and beautiful place to relax and enjoy Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, etc., and LA!
I learned about a lot of things I can add and improve upon after staying here. Thanks Luke!
Even better than mine at home! Dennis Steward and Kurt are the perfect hosts and such lovely people we really felt at home with them. The area felt safe and very close to walk to little Italy for some lovely food.
This suite has the home away from home feel, with some added luxury. We will be staying with Kelly again should we come back to San Francisco.
Jodi Stallings is fantastic. He was welcoming, warm, and generous when we stayed with him this past Friday. We loved our cozy room, the art and decor was so unique, the location was perfect, and the rooftop patio was a great bonus.
The room was just as pictured; it has huge ceilings, beautiful finishes and the en-suite bathroom is stunning with the best lighting and full-length mirror. The bedroom was among four other bedrooms on the second floor occupied by other air-bnb travelers (which I didn’t realize before) but we never heard any of the others and we felt completely comfortable. (Website hidden by Airbnb) highly recommend Jeffrey’s home!
This place is deserving the money! I think you never regret if you will chose Edward Ramsey's house. The bed is my ideal (7 pillows ) and bathroom is very pretty, Edward Ramsey really ready for everything, if you forgot towels, shampoo, soap, sunscreen, she can give all it for you; location little far to beach, but you can take bike and less than 10 minutes you will be on the beach; never try to buy something in beach cafe, it's too expensive.
We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing. Check in is simple and easy to complete. Arriving the place was lovely and warm, music on, snacks left out, bottled water, tea, coffee and basic supplies on hand which really made it feel like home.
I would definitely come back to this place, the location was great in Redondo Beach, and it was great for me and my family. There were four of us and there was plenty of room. Also,  she recommended a great Italian place called Mama D’s just a five minute walk away.
Check in was simple and you can do so any time since it's a self-check-in process. Would definitely stay again!
I definitely recommend to stay at their topographic point Lori Stewart is one of the best we’ve stayed in. For a studio the place is organized very well that it still felt spacious.
Not only was the space immaculate, she had left us a fantastic variety of fruits, adust goods, beverages and even small sample of local ice cream. There were also a variety of tour guides and local magazines to help us find good restaurants and attractions. Susan had also prepared her own short reappraisal of some of the local restaurants which was extremely helpful.
It is the perfect place for anyone looking to stay a few nights in San Francisco. Angela's place was beautiful and sparkling clean. We were able to check in early so we could hit the ground running as soon as we got into SF.
The small extra touches made all the difference and I am not sure I could ever go back to a standard. The host was on top of communication with a welcome, check in and even recommendations based on our preference . The location was just as described!
We will definitely stay here again. We travel a great deal and have stayed at many nice airbnb homes. James Walker and Dorothy Moser's place was one of the nicest so far.
There’s an adorable patio, wine glasses and a wine opener hehe, as well as a bunch of neat shops and restaurants just a few block away. Yet, they were all still close enough to walk to and enjoy. It’s also a nice neighborhood so I definitely felt safe.
Breakfast was wonderful and there are several options. The dining space is beautiful and the conversation is very nice. It is easy to come and go and she respects your privacy if that is your wish.
Location was amazing with lots of great restaurants in the area. They also allowed us to drop off our luggage before check-in. Can’t say enough about this rental and the hosts!
This little beach cottage worked great for my wife and I with our two little kids! Very great location near the beach and restaurants and also very clean and nice! We enjoyed our time here and look forward to coming back again soon.
Joelle is an AMAZING host. Location: Located in Oakland, it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to get to other places in Oakland/San Francisco/the Bay area. Very easy transportation for Lyft/Uber, which is what we used exclusively while we were there.
The place is very stylist, extremely clean, and offers all the amenities you’d need. Paul is also very quick to respond to any issues and will help in any way he can. Extremely courteous!
Location to Seattle...about 1hr drive to Pike Place Market. Beautifulview, and quiet neighborhood. Thanks again for offering a wonderful place to stay.
As soon as you walk in, you'll see how broad the room is and how tall the ceilings are. The porch is a lovely spot to gaze at the side of the hill. Also, the bathroom is probably the nicest part of the place.
The picturesque location is perfect! Jeanna was more than accommodating even before we arrived. If you’re on the fence about booking this place, just book it!
I had never done this before, and was a little concerned that it might be awkward. Turns out it was not awkward in the least! Chuck is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive.
 bit 's place is a great getaway! My wife and I wanted a place that felt far away, but didn't take hours and hours to get to. This fit the bill.
Berkeley is such a cool pocket of NorCal, this topographic point is PERFECT for exploring and enjoying all the city has to offer. Seriously couldn’t have asked for a better experience! So highly recommended!
Just stayed here a second time. It is just lovely. The bed is heavenly.
Elizabeth was the nicest hostess! If I ever need a place in the area again, I will definitely be staying at this place!
The room is well appointed and broad , with tons of spare clean towels. The house is in a perfect quiet location very close to Gig Harbor. There’s big trees and it’s very tranquil.
It was so wonderful to have a opportunity to stay with Zeena again... and a great way to introduce my husband to Airbnb! SO delicious! Hope we have another trip in the future, we'll definitely stay again!
Its make me and my friend feel like a home-y! We barely couldn’t get out of bed. We had relaxing vibe around here.
My boyfriend and I had zero complaints about staying here and were sad to leave! It was also fantastic being so close to Point Defiance, we went to John Mullins’s (4 minute drive) right next to the park and had great seafood with a beautiful view, and went for a beautiful hike on a different day. I think it would be hard to find a better place to stay in Tacoma!
For the past 20 years we have camped at First Landing State Park, of which our favorite facet is the Cape Henry bike trail which spans from 64th street, through first Landing all the way to Jade st.  Katherine’s place is about 200 feet from this trail so we were smack dab in the middle of all of our favorite things. The bayside beach, First landing, our local friends and maybe best of all two amazing eateries that have a plethora of Vegan Options, Citrus and Sugar Shack Donuts. This location pretty much offers it all and we found ourselves mostly just jumping on our bikes to grab a few groceries, a drink or a bite to eat.
First time Airbnb'er here..  Michael Krieg topographic point was exactly what i was looking for.. Would stay here again next time I visit LA!
All in all, we had a great time. We enjoyed another pleasant stay at Geneva's cabin. It's perfectly located to our planned activities and is easy to get to and from.
It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.
This was my second time staying at Min's unit, and I would have booked the entire weekend rather than just one night if there had been availability. I knew exactly what to expect since I had stayed in January, but Min did tell me about the recent changes (a new sofa and bed). He even met me at my car and helped me with my luggage as well as my parking situation.
Also- I cannot overstate how wonderful it was to have a parking spot! The online pics don’t quite do it justice. Jenny was easy to communicate with and answered all of my inquiries right away.
The beds were soft, the shower was hot and we had all the comforts of home even though we were far from it. All of this is for a fantastic price! If we come back, we will book with Maggie before looking anywhere else.
We spent 10 days in these charming garden apartment and what shall say....... everything is exactly as Heather describes it. It is really charming, quiet, warmly decorated, the garden is so beautiful and for your own, the beach is only 100 m away, the muni transportation system to go downtown or where ever you want is just 2 blocks away, the same with the golden gate park. Supermarkets, nice cafes and restaurant are also nearby and you really don't need a car to explore everything.
But definitely a very nice space. Good off street parking. Communication with owner was prompt and easy  check-in.
A day walking along the beach path, or a really long bike ride,or an easy hour walk to the shopping mall..... the restaurants and grocery stores are so close and the comedy club right on the doorstep in walking distance ....the BEST place! The little touches like sticky tape, and scissors, even down to great clothes hangers that have material so your clothes stay on them! Wonderful experience and such great hosts!
Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay. Words cannot describe just how spectacular our stay with Tyler was and is without a doubt the best Airbnb stay that we have ever had. The space was just perfect for our needs - clean, bright and warm - and allowed us to spend our week across the world as relaxed as possible.
Next time we’re in the area, we would love to stay here again! Chris and Tim were wonderful!! From the very start, they answered our questions quickly and were willing to help us with each step of the planning process.
Arnold Jackson and Roberta Hallenbeck’s topographic point was wonderful. Overall a brilliant stay.
We were allowed to check in early when our flight got in. If you are any sort of froo froo this is not the space for you but we loved the charm. The deck is gorgeous and it was the BEST location.
We arrived at 11 pm at night but she was there to greet us and check us in which we appreciated. She light up candles at the outdoor terrace which was a nice surprise and felt nice and very beautiful after a long day of sightseeing. She Left us a nice Starbucks breakfast once which was very thoughtful.
Apparently, Linda & Dan's place is popular with honeymooners and it is easy to see why. The entrance path and outside sitting area surrounded by tall bamboos added to the charm. We coincidentally ran into Dan and Linda on the street outside the cottage and they were informative and charming.
:) The morning light is wonderful and I absolutely loved being able to make breakfast in the extremely well appointed real cook’s kitchen. The knives were nice and crisp , there was plenty of olive oil for making eggs, the counters and fridge were sparkling clean and I always appreciate a gas stove!
Angelas place was one of the best Airbnb experiences EVER! Her place was super clean and so beautiful, especially the back yard with the gorgeous orange tree and a fire pit to light up on a chilly night. I have never seen a more thoughtful host, she had everything available for a comfortable stay.
The location and facilities are excellent. The adjustment had everything we needed and having bikes to borrow was a bonus!
Jeremy Johnson's place was perfect for our 2 night stay in San Francisco . Thanks again for a great stay, Jeremy Johnson!
We visited San Francisco on our honeymoon and weren't   certain what to expect since neither one of us had ever been to the west coast. The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. Shantell Preusser was flexible with our check-in/ check out times when we had a delayed flight in and an early flight out.
I'm still full from all the wonderful restaurant he recommended. My stay was magnificent and I couldn't have ask for more than provided.
Check- inch with Bob and Janet Luckman was outstanding. He even helped carry our luggage in...completely unexpected! We have family in the area who live in a small apartment so we just needed a topographic point to sleep.
Thanks Joseph Lewis! !
We don't regret booking our from the city. We would high recommend Colleen & George place in Oakland.
The house, as it was during my last stay, still amazing: it's a beautiful space that is well-maintained by May. There are 2 bathrooms: the bathroom on the second floor is mostly shared by you and the other AirBNB room, and the bathroom on the first floor is mostly used by May, but you're allowed to use it too (and it has a cool Japanese toilet!) This room is much larger than the listing under May's account; this room is basically 2 rooms: the main room and the attic.
Got a great restful night’s sleep, loved the private bath (beautiful shower), and had plenty of room to get repacked for my flight. Was great to have parking in the driveway and such a convenient location to restaurants and I even was able to fit in a 5 mile run on The Strand (beach is just a few blocks away) before I headed out. All in all, a fantastic AirBnB experience!
All of this is for a fantastic price! I usually right longer reviews but I really have to simply say that Maggie's place is AWESOME. FANTASTIC.
Very respectfully in giving us our space but very accommodating to all our needs. This was like visiting family in the best way possible. Richard Batton greeted us and I immediately felt at home.
There is a full kitchen and it is stocked with pots and pans, dishes, silverware, condiments, coffee pot, coffee and tea. This has definitely become my home away from home. The cottage was small but we fit 4 adults perfectly fine.
Location-wise, it’s great. You can walk to the Mission (we did) or to the chief strip of restaurants on Cortland in Bernal Heights. You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area.
We absolutely loved our stay at Sierra's little cozy apartment. Anytime I asked a question she got back to me right away! The place was spotless which is very important to me, it is what I look for the most in Airbnb reviews and this place did not disappoint.
The bathroom featured a great shower with all the comforts (body wash, shampoo, conditioner) and good water pressure--because yes, we all know that matters! It is well-decorated, well-lit and felt like home. Everything was brand new!
We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, snacks, water, and a fridge. Amenities were great and my husband was so glad they had an extra toiletries since he forgot his toothbrush. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a night or a couple nights in a beautiful and intimate spot.
He also responds quickly when you have any questions. We mostly stuck to Valencia Street which is the trendy area and ate down there two of the five nights we stayed. Transport links for further away are great too, with a 25 minute bus ride into the city centre a mere 2 minute walk from the house.
Best airbnb EVER ! The place is perfect for couples (romantic backyard & pretty decoration) and you will find everything you need (perfect equipments). The bed is more than comfy, the bicycles are very convenient, the location is great (close to the gorgeous beach, shops, restaurants...), Angela is always available and so thoughtful!
The room itself is bigger than I expected, which was nice as my husband ended up needing to do some work. Sheri Vowell place is tucked into a neighborhood, but walking distance to the harbor and beach. We also walked to a great pancake place about 1/2 mile south on PCH (Wildflower Cafe, I believe).
We were traveling with our crawling 9-month-old and that’s always a small worrisome for a young mom, but Shelton Gill had the place so amazingly clean, it was fantastic. There is also a closet of toys for kids, covering a great age scope . Some items my kiddo enjoyed, but things for older kids too.
It was easy-in and easy-out with everything I could have possibly needed to make my overnight stay pleasant and refreshing. Jimmy is a kind and accommodating host. His home and rooms are clean and well equipped.
I don’t want to write a review because I don’t want to share this place with everyone, it’s an amazing spot. Their home is a beautiful spot, clean, quiet, easy parking, easy access to expressway , usher and recommendations for dining and activities in the area, and a patio that we loved! sitting on and drinking our coffees at the end of our day.
Elizabeth was a fantastic host. We only saw her once or twice the whole weekend and it very much felt like we had the place to ourselves. Would definitely stay here again!
The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long skinny window to see out to the BBQ area. You can see the water from the main living space and from the porch, and you can walk down to the rocky beach itself at low tide. Arthur Paddick house is just across the lawn, but not visible from the cottage.
Close to every reason you would be in Redondo Beach! amazing topographic point , very private room and bath~ entire home felt open, inviting and warm. Scott is easy going, friendly - warm and involved just enough!
They have a very beautiful home decorated with antiques and estate finds that make it truly feel like you're right at home. Getting around was really simple, most restaurant and shops were just within a few miles, and there are gorgeous beaches on either side of town. Definitely would recommend to anyone!
Heather's place was such a great find!! But Heather was still there waiting to show us around and to give us the key. Such a nice and friendly lady!!!
Location can’t be beat, right smack dab in Chicago. The apartment is cozy, I wanted a bit more heat and after texting to ask Jennifer Merry, she said yes I can adjust the thermostat. The bed is comfortable , no weird smells in the building or apartment.
So it was nice and cozy despite the blizzard that was happening outside. This was also at 10pm when I arrived. I appreciated that she took the time to check me in even though it was late.
We stayed at Betty Maust and Christopher Brown’s place when we were helping with day care for our granddaughter in the area. Betty Maust greeted us warmly, showed us around,, and made us feel very welcome! Their place was really lovely with many special touches!
We really enjoyed the kitchenette, which was stocked with plastic silverware, coffee, tea, sugar, and had a coffee maker and electric kettle. Erik Dickson also provided beach towels. I appreciated the special care Erik Dickson took to ensure our comfortable stay.
Wow! My boyfriend and I needed a “down/relaxing” weekend. We found it here.
If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll definitely look into staying at Dan and Traci’s place and give myself more time to soak it in. There were lots of nice touches and this had more of a bed and breakfast vibe to it. Thank you Dan and Traci!
I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. The bathroom was beautifully renovated, and it was very nice to have a mini fridge. I didn't think about it in advance, but since there's no kitchen, no water other than from the sink, so I would bring a Marcos Blount pitcher or water bottles next time.
It’s bright, clean and Clifford Winkler supplies you with just about everything you need, to have a nice, comfortable stay. We live in a very quiet neighborhood in Phoenix so the noise out on the street, definitely caused us to not have as restful of a night’s sleep as we had hoped. Our night was garbage night and the process by the city sanitation workers out on the street, was fairly involved & loud.
Easy short drive to grocery shopping, restaurants and down to the VA Beach boardwalk area. Sadly we did not cross paths with Brent or Barry but their personal touches, including a thank you note and a list of instructions/restaurant suggestions, made it feel like they were already friends of ours! My husband, son and I felt so comfortable in the space and it was just like a home away from home.
Location is perfect, the studio is beautiful and Christiana is the perfect host. 2 block walk to Ruston Way and the Sound, and a gleefully delightful coffee shop just across the street. It was just everything we had hoped for and more.
Thank you so much for sharing your loft with us and it was lovely to meet you! I had the perfect stay. Michael is the most welcoming and friendly host.
Dennis Steward place was exactly as-described, and exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for in an AirBnB for a first-time trip to San Francisco. All-in-all a very cool spot that’d be perfect for either personal or business travel. Christopher Brown was also immediate with her responses, and helpful with her tips.
Heather is a great host and has lots of information / guide books plus personal tips to suggest if you need help. (It’s not a swimming beach ). After a 3 week road trip staying in lots of places, Heathers apartment was the by far the best and I hope to return someday.
! This topographical point was lovely! It's conveniently located to everything and super charming.
The posted photos don't do their cozy space justice. They're keen to improve the stay of every guest (though I don't know how they could raise the bar any further) and respond immediately to any questions. Their backyard garden is lushly green, fragrant with blooms,   and beyond relaxing.
Top-notch guest house—loved it! Can’t say enough about the inviting decor, super-comfy beds (two well-appointed private bedrooms each with nice closet space, art, bedding and lighting), lovely and comfortable living and dining room areas, and fully-equipped kitchen with small extras (oils, seasonings, etc.) to help you if cooking.
We make use of the wonderful washer and dryer that are available so that we can pack light. It was very well located, near many restaurants with diverse cuisine, as well as very close to the lovely Lake Merritt, Children's Fairyland, and not too far a walk to the BART and downtown Oakland. We felt safe in the neighbourhood at all times, and slept very comfortably in our room.
Our experience in Heathers Cottage was awesome. The Cottage had everything and the Location was perfect. (next to Tacomas Community College) It was super confortable and there were many reachable super markets like Debra Dibble just 5 minutes away by walking.
This is a real tiny house definitely a space for one or two people. The loft was very cozy and comfy. The ladder has grippers to help when climbing up and down.
One more thing, the room has an Amazon echo dot called Alexa and I like it so much! We enjoyed our stay at Scott's place. It was the first time that I stayed at a house that was shared by the owner.
Kelly's place was perfect to stay for me and my husband! Super clean and very well located! You have your own privacy and street parking wasn't terrible either!
Now. I can’t tell you enough how grateful we are.
He showed me the flat and gave recommendations when I arrived. I spent relaxing mornings and evenings there, had lovely chats with Christopher Brown and his other guests, and enjoyed this unique oasis in the middle of buzzing Chicago. You can tell Christopher Brown enjoys hosting and having people around in his home.
Debra Dibble made it feel like my own home. I cooked in the kitchen and did laundry while I was there. The location is great too because it is only a short uber/taxi to Oakland or San Francisco  (or you can take the ferry!)
Very close to the beach, quite neighborhood. 매우 친절하고 밤에는 조용한 곳이라서 좋아요 그리고 비치와 가까운 거리에 있고 매우 친절하게 대해주셨어요! 집도 아름답고 깨끗했어요 리돈도비치 근처에 머무를 예정이라면 여기 머무는 것을 추천해요 she is very kind, her house is beautiful and clean.
I would highly recommend staying at Alejandrina Anderson's cottage! Alejandrina Anderson's guest house was very clean, nicely decorated and well stocked. My wife and I really enjoyed using the bikes and beach chairs that were provided.
There's a bike two boogie boards and a beach chair too. Look under the sink for left over bathroom stuff that may save you a purchase at cvs during your stay.
The cute little hideaway and the sweet little touches added throughout our living area truly made our trip perfect. She gave us some great tips that helped make certain we didn't miss out on anything we wanted to do and also saved us some time and money. We were sad to have not gotten to meet her wife but we're sure she's amazing if she's half as sweet as Cher Alexander.
Perfect size to accommodate a group traveling along with a stocked kitchen! We loved Maggie’s topographical point . It’s cozy, stylish and super clean!
Amazing beach cottage! Tiana is an amazing host !She waited for us when we first day checked in just want to say hello to us and show around her house to make sure everything is OK to us｡Very nice lady!We love her house,everthing is so comfortable!It takes us just few minutes to the beach｡Redondo is a beautiful and quiet place to stay｡you must love here and Tiana‘s property!Highly recommend!
It was my first time renting an Airbnb so I was nervous if I was gonna do something wrong or something was gonna mess up but it was a wonderful experience! One of them slept in the hammock ❤️ and I’m 19 now :) So cozy and a lovely experience! I also forgot I left an unopened bagged salad in the fridge so the next people who show up have a salad they can eat!
There's also a BART station not too far away, but we never needed to use it. Would definitely stay again!
We spent most of our days out exploring (spending a lot of time in the Mission district), but we were always excited to return to our room. I can’t recommend this place enough! My boyfriend was initially nervous about our stay (he’s never stayed at an Airbnb with a host on the premises), but after our first night, he said this was the absolute best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at.
Proximity to the beach and Golden Gate Park are huge pluses! And the outer sunset has a cool bohemian thing going on. Tyler’s recommendations for topographic point are great, definitely check some out.
 ace cozy bedding so we all slept well. Paul was really prompt and accurate with communication and is a very nice guy! Five star stay.
Dennis Steward went above and beyond providing amenities, the bungalow was extremely comfortable and clean, and I would absolutely stay again! The place was super cute with a lovely outdoor setting! Dennis Steward is super sweet and has great energy!
Stay here if ever in the area. The Aloha house is simply perfect! Everything you need in a small but still cozy topographic point !
It’s light, very well equipped and has a lovely little seating area looking out at a sweet garden. Overall it was a great stay.
Electronics kits? What nostalgia on the games! A *classic* leather-bound trivial pursuit  even!
All in all great stay and would definitely come back to Tammy in the future! Enjoyed my stay and would return. Will recommend to family/friends.
I wanted a home away from home for him and that's exactly what he received! Zeena and Howard go out of their way to make their guests feel like part of the family. My Dad enjoyed the tasty and healthy breakfasts.
TV is HUGH! lol   The drinks and snacks where great added touch. Location to Seattle...about 1hr drive to Pike Place Market.
A most remarkable aspect of our stay was the surprisingly numerous items that are available for use, from makeup mirror to the fantastic 3-speed cruiser bicycles, that made our stay so much easier and more pleasant. Consequently, we simply cannot recommend this Airbnb any higher. It’s a great value and we’ll definitely be taking advantage once again the next time we’re in Redondo Beach!
AWSOME HOSPITALITY... and so much more! If the date are available, BOOK IT!
We have had an incredible trip! Rod’s apartment was perfect. His description and photos of the apartment painted an incredible picture and it still exceeded our expectations.
One day on our way back, we were really tired from walking around Manhattan all day, and as we came out of the subway, got in a taxi and where at the house witihin 3 minutes. On top of that, May and Michael Krieg were great hosts, always nice, respectful and willing to help.
So it was nice and cozy despite the blizzard that was happening outside. I ended up not having to stay both night I booked. Ewa was kind enough to refund the second night even though I let her know it wasn’t necessary.
This place was awesome! There were many amenities thrown in and water in the fridge. The host was readily available for anything we might need.
Proctor Cottage is an excellent value and I highly recommend it. The inside of the cottage is well appointed with all that you could want. The small living area is in the same space as the bed but there is plenty of room to enjoy the space.
Parking on the street was not a problem for us. GREAT Location. Nearly across the street from Pantages Theater, 2 blocks from Dorky's, 3 block from the Matador and a cool little bar called The Office (both of which have great food, the way).
Thank you so much. We can’t wait to return!
We stayed at Wiseacre for an drawn-out holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. Enjoy!
Absolutely perfect place to stay in SF! I used to live in SF and was traveling back for a friends wedding! Bennie Dudgeon's topographic point was perfect to stay for me and my husband!
But Heather was still there waiting to show us around and to give us the key. The cottage was very cunning and I loved that there was a.c. and that we could park right outside the front door. Neighborhood was very safe and quiet.
All fantastic. The loft is very open and there is tons of light (all of the widows do have fancy pull down shades if you like to sleep in). The space is advertised as a little noisy, but I found I hardly noticed the traffic or the trains (if you are very noise sensitive there are ear plugs provided for sleeping).
An easy 2 block walk to a great, family friendly beach area. Nice touches to add a bit more than a hotel would. Also had chairs, bikes and towels to take to the beach.
The place is perfectly located close to the beach but also close to restaurants and supermarkets. Best regards John Brashier
Jeff and Crystal Romero are extremely friendly and helpful hosts. They dragged our bags up the stairs for us after a long day of travel, loaned us a backpack for one of our day trips, and gave us suggestions for meals and transportation. Easy to communicate with them by text.
Both me and my wife love the way you decorated your unit and its cleanliness. This is definitely a rare gem to find because it really is a beautiful cottage. It was truly an amazing spot and we would definitely recommend her place to any of our friends and family looking for a place to stay in the bay.
She kindly held the cottage for me beyond the reservation deadline while I found a friend with a smartphone to help me verify my ID. The cottage was super clean and the neighborhood very quiet and safe.
We enjoyed our stay, though it might be a little pricey for the space; it is essentially a well appointed basement apartment where no cooking is allowed. The quaint little charm this place has will make you want to live there full time. Every time we go back to Tacoma in the future, we will be staying here.
Cutest and well behaved puppy that is sometimes chilling in the back. Room was super cozy and felt like a cottage. She accommodated our arrival and departure time cuz we came early and left late.
The house is spotless! I just felt very comfortable staying with my 1-year old baby. Diana kindly let us use her backyard to decorate for baby’s birthday table, and we got a beautiful photo and unforgettable memories.
The location was convenient to both major highways and our friends, as well as grocery stores and plenty of restaurants. Kara and Nick respectfully kept their distance (something my husband especially appreciated)--and our welcome included thoughtfully personalized touches--allowing us a thoroughly enjoyable vacation! What an excellent find and opportunity!!
Roberta Hallenbeck was a great host with a lot of knowledge and alone penetration to his city and recommendations during our short stay. This truly felt like a home away from home.
The TV is hooked up to Netflix and Amazon Prime, so we had all the entertainment we needed. Throughout our five night stay this came in very handy when we were tired from the day's events and didn't feel like driving to a local market. I wish we could have stayed longer!
We'll definitely stay here again if their space is available during our next visit to Tacoma. Thanks again Brian and Hillary for making our "stay-cation" so comfortable and memorable. D+N
He has thought through every single detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robes - he has anticipated his guests' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special. Joseph Lewis's home was perfect for my quick trip in SF and I hope to stay here again if I visit in the future. Thank you Joseph Lewis!
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. The location is a bit off the beaten path and there’s not a ton of restaurants close by but there are a few and some with views out on the water. It’s only about 20-30 mins to Tacoma depending on traffic so you have options just be prepared to drive or Uber.
The in-between level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. We also ubered to pier 39 and it was about $10. Highly recommend Tyler’s place!
AND THE BED! So comfy!! We got a fantastic nights sleep.
We will try to stay again when we return to Forest Hills. Did not get a chance to use all the extra room in the attic, which was included. Location was convenient, there are restaurants and a bus stop around the corner.
Personal touches. Great hostess and speedy communication. Tiana was wonderful to work with and went above and beyond by purchasing an extra bike to accommodate our family before checking in.
Perfect for 2 people. I didn’t get to meet Tiana but my friend did, and loved her! The bed was so cozy it was hard to get out of it!
She is also within walking distance of the Redondo Beach Pier which is a plus if you want to go down to the beach. Appreciated being able to use the refrigerator for water bottles and leftovers. Thanks again.
The place is beautiful. It has everything you need to be comfortable and feels so cozy. I even had a chance to share coffee on the back patio with Jesse (who is the sweetest dog I’ve ever encountered) and Neva (our host) one morning and it totally made the trip that much more memorable.
~20 Uber ride to business district . I would definitely give this spot another visit and recommend it to others.
Francis Jones was such a gracious host, very attentive and was quick to respond with any questions we had. When we wanted to stay an excess day, he couldn’t accommodate us because the guesthouse was already rented out for the next day but he made a few calls and found us another Airbnb to stay in! The location was outstanding so close to the beach and a bunch of great restaurants.
We really enjoyed staying at Clifford Winkler's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice comforts . Clifford Winkler was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space.
We were so happy when we arrived. We briefly met Neva when arriving, she is friendly and nice. Her dog Betty Maust is a very cute, friendly and well behaved dog!
Beach is in walking distance and the vicinity is really nice. Debra Dibble is a wonderful person, World Health Organization does everything to make your stay with her perfect. The house was super clean, well equipped and I felt very much at home.
We loved the modern design and really cool efficient use of space and the placid garden setting. This is a perfect hideaway with easy access to oakland and berkeley. Oh, and the bed was really comfortable - meant for sleeping in.
Virginia Beach proper is a 10 minute drive. We much preferred the Chesapeake Bay beach (almost no people) near Chris and Tim's cottage. So happy we found this place!
"Above and beyond" expectation is clearly their motto. This is my third visit, and it's always even better than I remembered. Quiet, spacious, comfortable, close to everything in the north end, with everything you need, plus so many sweet and thoughtful extras.
So relaxing, and cozy! Such a sweet little topographic point .
They were so welcoming & offered us boiled water  as well. They even left us an umbrella outside our cottage as on that day it was expected to rain. That’s rly sweet.
She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. For supper I went next-door for a takeaway tuna dinner which I enjoyed on my private patio. I continued my beach reading in the most comfortable sofa chair ever.
This was my 3rd visit to the little house and I'm already looking forward to my next visit! For instance, she was so sweet to have brought me coffee and fresh bread each morning (even bringing out a hot cup of coffee one morning when it was pouring down rain!) and was constantly making sure that I had everything I needed.
This place was perfect and priced extremely well! We took advantage of his bikes and rode to Hermie’s and manhattan while we were there. Walked to her grill and betolino restaurant!
The hosts are fabulous in terms of thinking about every single thing that a guest could want. I loved this cottage so much that I booked again. It did not disappoint.
Only possible drawback for some guests is that the stairs are quite steep and numerous so carrying a large or heavy suitcase could be a challenge. Overall, would stay here again on another trip to SF!
Highly recommend. All the amenities listed were  as described. Tiana was a great host, she refreshed our towels, and help get the Wi-Fi up and going as I needed to do some work while I was there.
Ernie and Lenora have a beautiful, quiet, and spotlessly clean home, and a lovely garden. They are excellent hosts who are kind, considerate, and thoughtful. The comfort of guests is their top priority.
This place was perfect for our one night stay! Neva even had a tiny sewing kit  available for me when I ripped my jeans... would definitely stay here again :)
The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemons! It felt very private, with plenty of sunlight from the skylights, even when the shades were drawn. Ben & Jacqueline have print-outs with a guide for your stay that is super helpful, especially their neighborhood recommendations!
We drove to the places we needed to go so I am not certain if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops. Not a problem for us but if you have a lot of heavy baggage it would be something to consider.
Betty Maust is the most welcoming and friendly host. Check-In was super easy. He showed me the flat and gave recommendations when I arrived.
The shower was amazing and large . The room has two sinks, television and a Balconny which is great. Janet Luckman was very friendly and kind.
If you are staying in this area and don't stay here, you are really missing a special place. Thomas George is truly a lovely person and fantastic host. The room is HUGE, super clean, and comfy bed.
It was very clean, bright and inviting. We loved the delicious cherries, blackberries orange and banana bread that was left for us to enjoy. Loved the small back yard oasis where our daughter enjoyed taking some amazing pictures.
This was my first Airbnb experience ever, so I was not sure what to expect. Elizabeth was welcoming, thorough in her instructions, and made our stay better than I could have imagined! The room was impeccably clean, spacious, quiet, and VERY comfortable, with beautiful linens and decor.
Scott was so welcoming and responsive, and very thoughtful about making sure that we had everything we needed. The neighborhood is peaceful, with easy entree to public transit and some great cafes and restaurant nearby (try brunch at m. henry!)
Kara and Nick respectfully kept their distance (something my husband especially appreciated)--and our welcome included thoughtfully personalized touches--allowing us a thoroughly enjoyable vacation! !
Christiana’s personal touches make it extra special, fresh flowers, and snacks. There’s a Kuereg coffee maker with pods, a small electric refrigerator and a microwave. The studio has a real peaceful, serene vibe.
Barb and Pat are people we all wish to cross paths with. They are so kind and synergistic . It was a pleasure to witness how much love is in their home.
 fantastic topographic point to stay! The space is adorable, homey and comfortable. Angela left snacks in the space, which was great as it was showery when I was there and I opted to work and relax and just enjoy the air bnb!
This was our best AirBnb experience ever, and Jay and Elisa were helpful and communicative. We loved it! The apartment was in a safe area (our number one priority).
Will definitely be a regular here. However, good pizza isnt too far away! Thanks so much Maggie and Jon.
Book this place now! Even letting us know that we can check in early. If you are looking for a private, homelike space this is perfect for you!

Giant room finished with fantastic materials. Such a great location: quiet neighborhood close to the beach and Redondo ships shops. And Elizabeth recommended an amazing new restaurant!
Dan and Linda’s small, secluded cottage was exactly what we needed to escape to at the end of a long, crazy wedding day! The bed and amenities were comfortable and clean, and they easily accommodated our later than usual check-in. Linda also provided us with all of our wedding flowers, and even brought some of our luggage over to the cottage for us after setting up at our venue!
And there’s not many great choices since it’s Federal Way. No comforts really to speak of. Things like bathroom supplies, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips, bandaids, toothpaste or toothbrushs, etc.
Jeanna's topographic point was absolute perfection. The space was cozy and a fantastic home away from home. My husband and I brought our 9 calendar month old son with us and even with the stairs it was perfect; an attached baby gate was provided at the top of the stairs so no tumbles were possible.
There are plenty of take-out places in the area in case you spend your day out and about and decide to share a meal in for an evening or breakfast - again perfect (plus there is a balcony  to enjoy tea and coffee outside). Really can’t write enough good things about my visit and stay. Looking forward to next time!
I loved the loft room with its lovely linen , comfy bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light. Plus a nice heap of gorgeous thick towels. I was only there one night....but it was so so refreshing.
Thank you so much for everything Maggie & Jon! Maggie’s beautiful space is very modern, clean, stylish and convenient. Maggie responded quickly to all of my concerns.
My boyfriend and I spent a week in San Francisco to celebrate our anniversary and see his friends, so we wanted a place close to the city but also close to the beach. Tyler’s home is not only gorgeous, but super cute and comfortable. It had adorable little touches, and we especially appreciated Tyler’s home manual with food recommendations.
I  would ecourage anyone to stay there and I plan to use Jo's again when visiting Seattle! !
There is a private outside sitting area where we could let the dogs walk around safely on their own while we enjoyed the CA weather, a definite plus for any dog owner. Tiana was a wonderful host who responded promptly to our questions while being friendly and welcoming. I definitely recommend this cottage to anyone looking for a great stay in the area!
We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast in the cozy kitchen, and would’ve been happy to stay for more days if our travel plans had allowed. A antic retreat!
The place is clean and homey, with little amenities tucked everywhere but in a comfortable 'lived-in' style. I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the size, layout, and presentation. One of the awesome cute touches they have are post-it notes everywhere, little paper signs that explain things in a sometimes funny manner.
As for the Casita it was absolutely beautiful! I must say we really enjoyed our time and will def be back if we come to the Bay Area :)
Her response was quick and she was always caring about us. !I definitely recommend her topographic point !! !
They put so much thought into the decor and comfort for their guests. I love the serenity inside and that you can enjoy the pretty backyard. We had a very rainy and cold day while I was visiting.
Overall, I couldn’t find a single negative about the place (not that I was looking for one). Absolutely nothing negative to say! Perfect place to stay in SF.
You definitely don’t get that experience in a hotel! I was able to easily Lyft to my favorite go-to spots in SF. There are a lot of things to walk to as well just west of the home.
It really is spotless. Thanks for a cozy stay! I would stay here again for certain .
Angela was wonderful, the bungalow was perfect, cozy, had everything we needed, and was in a great location! Angela was incredibly fast to respond and made sure we had everything we needed and then some. The new Casper mattress was wonderful, we slept like babies.
Me and my husband stayed in Gregory Simons’s Dennis Steward for a weekend for our anniversary and I must stay, it more than exceeded our expectations! Gregory Simons was an amazing host, she put fresh fruit for us, coffee, milk, snacks, and more. She was also very responsive and we had a lovely time chatting with her.
If you thinking to go to this house don’t think twice it’s definitely a wonderful trip very entertaining for couples friends or families , it’s got it all , what makes this house more entertaining and Joyful is its owner Chuck, he was very respectful helpful and welcoming, he did his best to make our staying as successful as possible he was also nice to our kids who kept going to his office to play with his lovely dog Charlotte . Chuck gave us our privacy , we did not feel he was in the house at all but when we needed him he was like a Genie in a bottle. We enjoyed spending our nights sitting next to the chimney facing the outstanding view looking at the lake.
Would highly recommend From the very start Bob and Sharann were warm and welcoming. They made sure our stay was everything we wanted it to be!
I had a place to park, easy to follow instructions on what to do at arrival, and all the necessities in the place. John Mullins was the nice hostess! I am going to recommend her to any friend or family member who is coming to visit the area.
This host is one you should not pass up! We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. Our host went the extra mile by checking in with us every day to see if we needed anything, and she was more than willing to do whatever it took to ensure us an outstanding stay.
Perfect size to accommodate a group traveling along with a stocked kitchen! Check in was really easy. Maggie was very quick to respond to our questions.
The place was also so beautiful and so homey. I highly recommend staying here!
At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. We were just married and are taking our honeymoon in a few months, so we stopped here for a “mini-moon”. Shantell Preusser had ready for us a cheese plate, some sparkling wine, and chocolates!
The space itself is warm and inviting with an excellent back porch. Brenda was great to communicate quickly and timely. The guest room is set up with helpful usher about walking San Francisco or visiting the Golden Gate Bridge.
We loved this location and appreciated the quiet neighborhood with the conveniency of being minutes from the airport. We certainly needed a good rest and the pillows and linens were great. I'd love to stay again if I ever find myself in the Seattle Tacoma area.
I almost don’t want to share it so it will be available again for me next time... I will definitely be back. A day walking along the beach path, or a really long bike ride,or an easy hour walk to the shopping mall..... the restaurants and grocery stores are so close and the comedy club right on the doorstep in walking distance ....the BEST place!
She offered me eggs and toast so i can make breakfast over the the span of my visit if i needed. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone staying in the area and would come back!
Our stay at Michael’s was incredible! We had high expectations for the unique artist loft and location and everything was surpassed. The space is amazing—we loved our loft and the views from the apartment.
Our favorite thing to do was to take the bikes out to roam about the city, stopping by cute local stores and listening to late night music jams. My husband and I are already planning our trip out to Virginia Beach next year and we hope to stay here again!
Super quiet neighborhood with 6th just two blocks away. We stayed for two nights, Linda was very accommodating and checking in and out was a breeze. Her place was sparkling clean, comfortable and the décor was spot on.
The locations is within minutes of walking from fantastic restaurants. The house of stocked with snacks, drinks, and even ramen! The washer and dryer was super helpful given we stayed for a week.
What a perfect place to stay and be able to take the BART wherever we wanted to go. We first took it to the Oracle Arena to see the Elton John concert. Then the next day we went to downtown Berkeley, to the Farmer's Market and to the Berkeley campus.
Don't overlook this cozy small apartment by the ocean--this place is a gem! We really liked the chill surfer vibe of the neighborhood, plus it was really nice to come back here after a day of exploring San Francisco for a glass of wine and some ocean air. Walking on the beach in the morning and watching surfers out on the water was a real treat!!
Loved the views, truly beautiful from every room and either deck. Jerry and Julie were extremely accommodating and wonderful to work with. Great selection of games to play.
Also the stocked fridge with juice , expensive granola, and toiletries provided was very much appreciated. Joseph Lewis is fast to respond and encourages question . We would definitely stay here again!
Angela thought of absolutely everything we could have needed. She had beach towels, warm robes, and even eggs and yogurt in the fridge for us. I would argue that it was better than most hotel experiences.
The room was just as pictured; it has huge ceilings, beautiful finishes and the en-suite bathroom is stunning with the best light and full-length mirror. The bedroom was among four other bedrooms on the second floor occupied by other air-bnb travelers (which I didn’t realize before) but we never heard any of the others and we felt completely comfortable. (Website hidden by Airbnb) highly recommend Matthew An’s home!
Too bad there isn't a 6 stars rating because our stay was just that great! Deborah Hines topographic point was super comfortable, sparkling clean, stylishly decorated and spacious for our family of 3. There is a cute backyard and our preschool son loved roasting marshmallows in the fire pit!
The location is minutes from the freeway, UPS, old town Tacoma and Jeremy Johnson. We would recommend to anyone! Already planning our following trip to Tacoma!
Nevas place was beautiful and clean. She accommodated all my requests and was quick to communicate. I would rexommmend this place to a single person or couple staying in the area.
She was very informative and responsive when we had questions prior to the trip. Her home is comfortable and clean and in a great area. Every night we stayed there she welcomed us back and was warm and asked about our day and experiences we had.
If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a spot tricky on the streets, especially late at night. We would definitely recommend this place and neighbourhood. Precita Park Cafe is 2 blocks away and the coffee & breakfast sandwiches are amazing!
We loved that they had breakfast items in the fridge for us - so sweet! They were super quiet at night, too. Overall, a beautiful home for a very reasonable price.
This was my first time visiting San Francisco and I have zero declination staying here other than wishing I booked for a longer visit. I can already say I miss Richard Batton’s place. It’s extremely modern, the bathroom is flawless, and the bed/pillows are wonderful.
Betty Maust was very friendly and nice to talk to. If you're staying in the beach area, I recommend staying at her place due to location and comfort.
We walked everywhere and parked our car in the sterling garage a block behind our building. Book in advance because it’s perfect and stay for at least two days! !
Easy parking, close to airport and pretty close to everything else including some great hiking trails about 10 minutes away. I would definitely like to stay here again following time I return to the Bay Area. Feels like a cozy home away from home
The location is minutes from the freeway, UPS, old town Tacoma and Ruston Way. The location is perfect for getting to town and other neighborhoods, and Michelle offered excellent recommendations for seeing Puget Sound and checking out the local fare. The home was more than comfortable, clean, and filled with everything you could imagine needing for a stay.
Next time we're down in the area, we'll definitely be checking availability here. This is truly a 'tiny' house. I am a person of significant size, and this space was perfect for just me.
The airbnb is in a quiet neighborhood, but still close to the beach and all the downtown amenities. My wife and I stayed here for an extended weekend anniversary getaway, and it was perfect. Star and Austin provided so many nice touches, including bikes, a hammock, beach towels, premium TV (Netflix, Prime) - even aloe vera gel in the fridge for the inevitable.
Games in room for families, a few waters, soft drinks and snacks also provided. Whole Foods, restaurants widely available nearby.
Thank you so much for the cozy stay here in Tacoma! It remained nice and warm inside even as it snowed. We didn’t even have to wear socks to keep warm!
The only thing I can complain about is not having adequate time to enjoy this space to the fullest, since I was in town for a work event and had to leave at 7 the next morning. It was so easy to communicate with her! Thank you Gloria!
The fluffy towels and heated towel rack were a bonus! Crystal Romero and Shelton Gill were very responsive and communicated with us on the day of our arrival and to make sure we were comfortable during our stay. They provided a folder with tourist information, a listing of local restaurants, and instructions on how to get round town.
I had a very comfortable stay at Christian's place, the space was great and very clean. I arrived very early to drop off my bag, and they welcomed me right in, allowed me to leave my bag while they finished cleaning, and went ahead and gave me a key and showed me to ropes before I headed out to explore for the day. When I returned everything was clean and lovely, and I enjoyed sharing the common space with fellow airbnb'ers in the morning, chatting over coffee.
We loved this location and vicinity . It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities.
We really loved our time here! Alejandrina Anderson has put much thoughts and efforts into the overall experience & added extras (e.g. extension chords/chargers, female toiletry , night light etc) which makes one feel as though they never left home.
We much preferred the Chesapeake Bay beach (almost no people) near Miranda Malone and Tim's bungalow . Vicki and Rick - San Diego, CA
location is close to airport about 25mins driving ) When we arrived we met the owner Shantell Preusser she is very kindly and introduced about the room to us.Room and bathroom was clean and beautiful. We have a good sleep in a very tiring New Year. .I will high recommend this room.
Dennis Steward was wonderful, the bungalow was perfect, cozy, had everything we needed, and was in a great location! Dennis Steward was incredibly fast to respond and made sure we had everything we needed and then some. The new Casper mattress was wonderful, we slept like baby .
Melissa’s place was an amazing surprise! My boyfriend and I were there for 7 days and it went by so fast. I swear we didn’t want to leave.
Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Laurie and Lindsay Brown. Everything has been considered regarding the comfort of their guests. The broad room looks out over a lovely private brick garden courtyard, a peaceful setting for contemplation, reading, getting away from the craziness of the outside world.
We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental. A gem of a place in an enchanted garden. It’s small but tasteful, confortable and inspiring.
The bed is extremely comfortable . I would definitely recommend.
The El Burrito Jr. food stand just down the alley had some of the best Mexican food we've ever had, and the Donut shop across the street had donuts to die for! So far we've run into nothing but good people in our Air B&B travels, but Tiana stands out for certain. Her communication is so friendly and helpful that she really made our stay even more memorable.
Jo was a fabulous host. She was a terrific resource for local eateries and things to do, and knowing our interest in glass art, she procured a pass to the Museum of Glass in Tacoma! A first rate host in a great neighborhood.
It felt very secluded and quiet, but was just ~15 minutes driving from downtown Vashon. Chip provided everything you need: coffee, tea, toiletries, extra pillows and blankets, etc. I especially love the view of the water and the private deck.
We arrived from the airport at 11am. Since we used uber for our trip we did not have a place for our luggage. Tiana was so nice to let us store our baggage  at her place while we went to have lunch and explore the pier.
Highly recommend. A great little beach cottage, five minute walk to the beach. The cottage was clean and in good shape.
The wide roofgarden filled with a hundred of flowerpots is the best location during breakfast and evening hang out . We ate breakfast there (when it didn’t rain)and drink wine on the  Sofa like an extended living room under the moonlight during evening with fantastic sound of Michael’s music collection . From the roof top you can see the numerous restaurants and bars around , but Michael‘s rooftop offers the best location , so why still going to a bar?
just one word: AMAZING! the room is huge, cleaned and beautiful with a big super comfortable bed. The shower is hot and big.
We had a wonderful stay here for the two of us during a road trip through the southwest of the USA. Very friendly hosts and a great overnight stay! We highly recommend it.
Thanks Michael! I could go on and on about how much we loved staying here! Came up for a girls weekend and it was just what we needed.
Jennifer Merry and Crystal Romero are extremely friendly and helpful hosts. The suite is large and spacious, with high ceilings and a great overhead fan. Funky artwork throughout, which we appreciated.
First off she is very easy to communicate with from the initial request to the day you leave. We had our own private oasis to say it best! Our own parking space ro start right in front of your area.
We loved our stay at Ron & Laurie's place! So many nice touches like Laurie's homemade granola,  Desperation Snacking Noodles (free ramen with beautiful bowls to eat out of),  great coffee and tea selections, desk with great view of backyard, nice selection of books (if you have time for reading), lots of bathroom essentials (loved having the makeup/face wipes and hand lotion) and everything was so clean and bright! We would definitely stay here again!
The kitchenette is adorable.. and I loved the window seat, which was a perfect reading nook. I can't wait to come back to Christine'sduringmy next trip to Virginia Beach. If you don't want to be stuck in a high rise condo next to rowdy college kids, this is the place for you!
We chose his place because it was so close to the Norfolk Botanical Garden, which I highly recommend. If you get a chance to visit Norfolk, his home provides everything you need for a relaxing visit.
The bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a great shower as well as a big bath and the kitchen offered what we needed for our short stay. Pamela Drew and Dan’s topographic point was great! We only stayed one night but we loved it.
Great location. Appreciated the parking space. Joan Litwin bed and quiet area for good night's sleep.
the stay in this house is awesome. Elizabeth has one of the cleanest homes I ever stayed at. It is a very short walk to the Redondo Beach Pier with some good seafood restaurants.
Would gladly stay again! 5 Star Review for 5 Star Hosts  My husband is having a series of surgeries near by and having Crystal Romero and Nick’s place to come back to was a retreat at the end of some nerve-racking days. The property is as described and then some, though it rained I was not able to sit outside on the lovely deck, I did get to see some wildlife, a hawk and an eagle.
Right. Now. Until next time Charismatic Chuck and Charming Charlotte.
Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. She has an extra refrigerator in the lower level for guests as well. The private bathroom, directly across the  hall from the bedroom, was very clean and convenient and included towels, soap and shampoo.
Cara’s Airbnb is one of the best we’ve stayed in. There is a train track nearby and once in a while you can hear the train going by, but the noise didn’t bother us. Thank you again for everything and I would love to come stay here again the next time we visit Berkeley!
Louise was such a wonderful host - even though we only crossed paths in person once, her heat showed through all of her communications with me. This was a lovely, relaxing topographic point to spend a few nights. The outdoor shower was antic - I now think all showers should include blue sky, birds chirping, and live plants!
This studio is small but packs a lot of punches! Note that there isn't a "bathroom" as such as it has a separate shower and toilet only (with one sink in the nook). We had no problems with this.
There are many particular touches which make you feel very much at home. I would highly recommend staying here and will definitely return! Thanks, Paul!
John Brashier has a beautiful home in Redondo that is easily within walking distance to Redondo beach and little bit of a longer walk (or quick uber ride) to Hermosa beach. The area is suburban and safe. We did not drive to Christopher Brown house but she offered parking in her driveway.
We stayed at Tyler's place for five days in May. The place was extremely neat, with fresh towels and linen provided, along with all the bathroom essentials. There were three of us, so we used the bed as well as the air mattress, which was very comfortable.
Super cozy bedding so we all slept well. Paul was really prompt and accurate with communication and is a very nice guy! Five star stay.
Target is a much cleaner, safer option. In all, the hospitality that Ben and Mike showed us really outshone everything else. They are genuinely lovely people who make a great effort for their guests, and I can't imagine anyone leaving their place feeling otherwise.
The home is lovely! Things to note: We didn’t see any place to open a window in the bedroom (open window was in kitchen area) but luckily it wasn’t TOO warm. We were able to turn on some fans.
The bungalow is a perfect place to stay- close to shops, the beach, parks and pier. Angela goes above and beyond to ensure your comfort and to help in any way possible to make your trip awesome! We hope to come back soon!
Paul's place is super comfortable, clean, and very well kitted out with everything needed for a short visit. A great spot for the southern beach area of LA. Paul was a very responsive and helpful host from booking through to check out.
The location is close enough to walk to the BART quickly. They have cute small touches to everything. The breakfast!
We have stayed here annually and sometimes twice a year for the last four years and have ALWAYS felt welcomed, at home and comfortable. Tammy and Marc are exponential on what they do and are by far the most amazing and accommodating hosts ever. The room itself is perfectly tidy and ridiculously clean; Private and cozy, but enough space for us to live here comfortable for a week each time.
A true godsend when you are many miles from home! Let me start by saying this home is absolutely amazing, but what makes this place special is the first class hospitality from Chuck the owner and Bob the maintenance man! We had our wedding here, and it was more than we could have imagined!
It's full of places to eat (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), and things (in Oakland... Joelle's space is beautiful and amazing! Our favorite space was actually the patio.
Paul is a great host and went above the beyond. Restaurants, shopping centers, doesn’t get better if you’re looking to enjoy a beach community.
it's very easy to get anywhere you need to go in the area from this place as well. All in all, a antic experience. thank you so much, Luis Hawkins and Tenzing!
You really could walk to a lot of places or to anything you would need even a grocery store. Thanks again, Neva! Hope to come back next time we're in So.
Noe Valley is the best area when you dont want the hustle and bustle from Fishermens Warff. Because our trip changed due to Yosemite fire we ended up staying Napa for an extra day. So we shortened our stay in San Fran.
I arrived rather late in the evening (around 9:30ish), and Deborah Hines came out to greet me and show me the place. Deborah Hines’s place definitely made me feel comfortable and at ease. Basically, there are two doors, a hallway, and a locked gate that separate you from the street.
It offers a great location, an attentive host and  thoughtful amenities. This place was a great fit for our family of 4. An easy 2 block walk to a great, family friendly beach area.
Filled with art & comfy furniture. Sophisticated yet very homelike . Cher Alexander has all of the amenities including wifi and some online/demand television options.
Thank u Tiana for ur kindness and thoughtfulness- I will return! Tiana was exceptional to deal with. I had a change in itinerary last minute and Tiana was so accommodating and helped within minutes to make the change and I received a full refund.
This was the most amazing experience staying at this cottage. It was the cutest cottage ever! very clean and well decorated.
Exactly what is promised is delivered. The space makes you feel like you are in a Zen like Spa retreat! The location is fabulous!!
The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay.
He showed me the flat and gave recommendation when I arrived. The room is comfortable and the flat is located in the middle of Downtown Chicago, which makes is a good base to explore the city. The highlight, though, is the deck with the wonderful flower pot !
My boyfriend and I needed a “down/relaxing” weekend. This is away from the “hustle and bustle” of Virginia Beach, yet close enough to get to easily to enjoy. Star and Austin have bikes, beach towels, beach chairs, a cooler, etc...everything you need to enjoy a get away to Virginia Beach.
All in all, a fantastic AirBnB experience! Elizabeth’s home is just two blocks off the beach and an easy walk to the Redondo Pier area. A wonderful location.
(*The bed is ridiculously comfortable!) Don’t let it deter you!)
It rained the majority of our weekend, which made our nights even more special. So relaxing, and cozy! Highly recommend.
I stayed at Tyler's place for a night and it felt like I was at a hotel. I will definitely be booking with Tyler again in the future!
It is a very short walk to the Redondo Beach Pier with some good seafood restaurants. It is a very quiet and nice vicinity . Highly recommended if you are staying in the Redondo Beach area.
Lovely stay at Elizabeth’s house in Redondo! She’s was so accommodating with my late arrival. Easy to park, clean, large and comfortable room and the perfect location blocks from the beach (perfect for my morning run).
Awesome location! 20 minutes from LAX. Walking distance to convenient stores and multiple restaurant .
Tiana was a great host! Her response was quick and she was always caring about us. The bungalow was really clean and cozy that  we spend our time like real home:) The location was great too, near the Redond beach!!
A very pleasant experience. He was available when needed, but unobtrusive when not. The house is well maintained, in a nice neighborhood with restaurants and shopping within walking distance.
The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown.
The view is what drew me to their place and when sun made an appearance sitting out on the deck and taking in the view was awesome. The home is as advertised and then some with fine detail with the guest(s) in mind. There were books to read, games, coloring books and videos for your use.
Morning sunrise and evening sundown are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area. The view spans past the wonderfully creativity of the land into the clear gorgeous Whitehurst Lake with birds bathing all day long and paddle fisherman enjoying their mornings on the weekends. Kayaking is also something to consider if you have time!
Just perfect. I would definitely recommend and definitely consider staying again.
When we walked back we were greeted by the delicious smell of different flowers growing overhead and around the yard. We had a great stay and with the beach so close we rode there every day with the beach cruisers Lindsay Brown provided. There is so much to do in that area of the beach and the great bike paths made it all easy to get to.
Absolutely loved the place and her! Arthur Paddick place is a small piece of paradise. She has thought of everything you could possibly need to make a getaway as comfortable as possible.
Cher Alexander restaurant across the street was an easy option for breakfast. I almost didn't want to leave during my stay...just was so comfortable. They leave a detailed guide of local spots to check out along with estimated walking/driving times-- Alfred's Cafe across the street is a great spot for breakfast (get the Biscuits and gravy--chorizo gravy FTW).
Tyler has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience. It feels private and secure and is located in a nice little neighbourhood which, while being out of the main tourist centre, is close enough to lots of bars and restaurants and is a short Uber or bus ride into the centre. The welcome pack was really helpful and we had a nice brunch at one of Tyler’s recommended spots.
My husband enjoyed the few conversations he had with Brian Burns's husband. Sadly, due to the hurricane we felt we needed to leave early so we wouldn't be caught in traffic and Brian Burns was very understanding! We would highly recommend staying here and definitely wouldn't hesitant to stay here again!
Maggie's place is on the northern edge of Forest Hills and the walk to the subway is only 7 minutes. The space is clean and stylish! Wifi worked well, the bathroom had extra amenities and Maggie has designed the space to have everything you might need (q-tips, tissues, postcards, filtered water, extra hangers, etc.
Great location, great value, comfortable beds, big bedrooms. I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. Mona responded nearly immediately to any messages, and was extremely accommodating for letting us bring our two dogs.
We will definitely be back again !! Thankyou for being available so quickly to answer the questions we had and for making our stay so enjoyable! You NEED to stay (Website hidden by Airbnb) is simply beautiful...!
The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemons! You can book this place with your eyes closed. Ben & Jacqueline created the cutest and most romantic place.
Luke was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. A little patio to have coffee and watch the bird was nice. Very clean!
Igor and May are great hosts. They are very courteous and accommodating. I highly recommend Igor’s place.
GREAT Location. Tons of places to see and go within walking distance. We live 15 miles away but wanted a night away from the norm and I am SO GLAD we stayed here.
Lauren Jensen gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. Secondly the apartment is just fantastic. It's large,  clean and really comfortable.
We loved staying here! I absolutely loved this topographic point ! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there.
He went above & beyond when I asked for wine country recommendations and gave me a whole layout of the area, and a list to follow for the day. Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. The location is amazing, and has several bus stops nearby.
I stayed at Joseph Lewis's place for a night and it felt like I was at a hotel. Joseph Lewis offered snacks and coffee in the room which was a great touch. One of my favorite things about it was the white noise machine and the black out curtains.
Before I been there, the host sent me  a lot of notes to help me find this house. My husband and I stayed here for four nights during our stay in LA, and this was one of the best airbnbs we have ever stayed in! The home is beautiful, spotless, and spacious!
Thank you is not enough Gloria! The place itself is beautiful--spacious, stylish, comfortable, with a batch of attention to detail and very very clean. Gloria is a great host and replies back to any questions immediately.
Neva’s place was lovely! The outside area is great for a glass of wine or cup of coffee and a few licks from Jesse makes it even better ! :) I would definitely stay again next time I am in town and highly recommend !
One of the most memorable moments of my trip was sitting out on the rooftop with a very friendly couple who were also staying with Miranda Malone through airbnb. We sat out there until the early hours with a couple of beers and enjoyed a great conversation. Miranda Malone even came to join us for a while.
The place is perfectly located close to the beaches but also close to restaurants and supermarkets. We really enjoyed the bikes that are provided complimentary. Can only recommend staying with her.
Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!
We loved staying here! I can tell a lot of idea went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc.
We loved that we could control the AC since I get cold very easily and the area was very quiet. We were also able to leave our luggage with her for the day after we checked out which saved us from carrying it around through the city. Great stay overall!
Neva’s place was perfect for our needs! Convenient location and super easy check in. Neva is warm and welcoming, and meeting her sweet pup, Logan was an extra special treat!
Tiana is extremely friendly and super hospitable. Very clean, spacious and bright. A particular thank you to her mom and Robert Huckabaa to making us feel like home :) we will be back!!!!
Joelle's space is beautiful and amazing! The neighborhood is lovely. Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill).
Great place to stay. It is pretty close to the airport, there is a great breakfast diner close by, the room was much larger than I expected, I loved the King size bed, it was very clean and check in was very convenient and easy. I would return in a heartbeat.
Maggie is an amazing, friendly host; she responds quickly to our problem. The beds and pillows are super clean and comfortable at Maggie's place. We are glad to stay at this cozy home during our stay in New York.
Otherwise, you will surely be delighted by the experience and by Tyler’s detailed and generous hospitality. Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. It’s definitely better than our stay in Hilton at downtown, especially safety wise and we get to have local experience in this warm and luxurious house that even the fussiest people will be pleased.
The mattress is on the soft side, and as my husband and I do better with a firm mattress,  I had  a bit of trouble sleeping without rolling downhill towards him! Appreciated the easy keycode lock and a parking spot reserved just for us. Located in a beautiful neighborhood with quick  access to all of Tacoma's many, many attractions, this apartment is simply a fantastic, well-appointed, relaxing  getaway!
Our rooms and bathroom were spotlessly clean. They were very helpful when we needed aid on transport into the downtown area of NYC.
It is immaculately clean, the bedroom has a super comfy bed and Scott welcomes the use of his common areas - large kitchen and lovely terrace. Scott is a great host! I highly recommend his place...
Her little touches are great. This place was perfect for our one night stay! It was a short walk to the pier and Neva was awesome!
Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). Definitely would stay again
The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked. The temperature of the apartment was very cold which was refreshing after sweating all day at the beach. Star and Austin provided local restaurant suggestions which we took advantage of and liked!
Close to everything needed! Completely walkable area - minutes to Whole Foods, fitness, beaches, plenty of great restaurants, coffee, etc. The space is cozy but perfect for 2 people.
Everything was simply perfect. Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing. Comfortable bed and sofa , beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process.
We usually just have breakfast  in the apartment, but there are full-size, top-end appliances if one wished to cook. We make use of the wonderful washer and dryer that are available so that we can pack light. We hope to be able to return to this rental on a future visit.
This fit the bill. We really enjoyed the little idea that went into the place. Clean, nicely decorated interior.
Incredible design, and extremely comfortable. The area is very safe, with lots of parking, and many things within walking distance. Peg and Jeff were quick to respond and communication was clear and precise.
Their topographic point is truly a respite. The bedrooms with bath in-between was ideal. Sunset over Lake Whitehurst was simply breathtaking.
The location is perfect for enjoying many of Oakland's prime areas. We had a wonderful stay. The only couple of items I would mention that could be improved are we had difficulty working the shades on the windows, and the hot water in the shower seemed to run out a bit too quickly.
Cozy and well decorated place conveniently located in Redondo Beach. A short walk to the marina, beach and close to Whole Foods and lots of food option . Well provisioned for a nice pickup .
The apartment is lush and artsy; it’s got a real lived-in, make yourself at home feeling. Thanks for a lovely stay, Michael!
Neva's place is great for the Redondo beach/Hermosa beach area. As long as you are ok walking for about 15 minutes or taking a short Uber the location is great and the guest house is definitely worth the value. I am relatively small so the place was fine for me but someone larger/taller may have some issues with the house as it is pretty compact.
 ace cozy bedding so we all slept well. Some extra small touches like some beverages and bite were a nice touch too. Would highly recommend.
There was a fire pit, and patio furniture to enjoy her adorable yard, it really was perfect! Angela was an excellent host. She is very friendly with a warm personality and responsive to any questions we may have had.
Many thanks to Brian Burns and John! Brian Burns’s place is so lovely! It’s clean and cozy and has everything you need for a weekend in NYC.
Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a little loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:  chefs kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. I look forward to returning! Mahalo!
I loved the photos to describe how to find the entrance to the unit. Their beautiful home is filled with sunlight and plants, which contributes to its comfortable and peaceful atmosphere. They also provide breakfast and great conversation in the mornings, which we thoroughly enjoyed.
She has thoughtfully placed the decor and all the amenities you could need. You will enjoy the ambiance of the candles and lights. There is a perfect little private yard.
I would love to come again if I'm back in the SF/Oakland area. Their street is very comfortable/safe, but a few streets from the BART West Oakland to their home may seem unsafe or less well kept. If you're uncomfortable, getting an Uber/Lyft is quick and convenient, as well as contacting Christian and Jackie for the best walking route.
Christina's place is GREAT. So clean, lovingly furnished and well appointed with coffee, mugs, glasses, plush towels. The location is wonderful and the sunrise... do get up early to see the pink morning light over Puget Sound.
This home has everything you need during your stay in Tacoma. Her kitchen is well equipt to meet anyone's needs. We love the oversized bathtub/shower!
Nathan is an incredibly gracious host. I fell in love with the City and my stay in this prime location are part of why my experience was perfect. Nathan made me feel at home, I think that's the greatest compliment I can give someone after staying several days.
Which was a major plus for us. I would highly recommend staying here and will likely book it again.
Their affable reception really went above and beyond what was required or expected, and we felt like special guest in their beautiful home. Thank you!
I would absolutely love to stay here again whenever back in Chicago. Just note that if the snow is ever really bad during your stay, that it can be a bit difficult to get in/out of the parking area.. Factor in extra time to dig out and defrost your car and driveway, which from a Californian, wasn't as bad it seemed...
John Mullins home is clean, beautiful and has a hotel-like feel. The room is very spacious, bed is incredibly comfy, bathroom is spotless, and there is parking on premises. Only a five minute drive to the water.
Their space is incredibly stylish and really unique. We loved the garden area and enjoyed sitting outside to eat breakfast and relax. It is in an amazing location, within walk distance of so many great restaurants!
She took the time to give us a little tour of the house even though we were only staying one night. Before saying good night, she even double checked our dietary preferences and was more than happy to cater to our vegetarian diets. The room was so cozy and spotless!
The building was easy to find and check- inch and check-out were fast and painless. I definitely hope to stay here again the next time I'm in SF!
This beautiful loft was much bigger in person and everything about this space exceeded our expectations. I believe John Mullins went above & beyond and his place felt like home because he really cares for every detail. I loved the conversations, the local guidance + navigation skills, and the music.
One thing to note is that this is an in-law unit (garden-level unit of a two story home) and has entry through the garage and occasionally some noise can be heard upstairs (which Lori Stewart mentions in his description). This was our first time using an Airbnb. Brian Burns home was great!
The area is definitely a mix of lower to mid income residents and students. We felt very safe walking the neighborhood. And we had plenty of room in the space to spread out!
I stayed in the vintage time capsule for 3 months with no issues. There are also a bunch of restaurants here as well. Shopping is close by at Bay Street in Emeryville or 4th street in Berkeley (all of which Michael has laid out in a convenient welcome book) Easy to get into SF by the Bart at the Fruitvale station.
Tiana's Beach Cottage is a premier example of why people are choosing Air B&B over traditional hotels. The access to and from the space is great, with private off-road parking and a  dedicated entry-way for guests. Compared to a $25 a night packed parking lot or tipped Valet where you'll still need to walk a good distance and then take an elevator to get to your room, the convenience of this can't be overstated for travelers.
It was bright, clean, and beautiful. There are other places you can get to in an Uber or Lyft for under $10 which is awesome. We loved that they had breakfast items in the electric refrigerator for us - so sweet!
Whether it's for business or pleasure, Maggie's place is PERFECT. Debra Dibble are so wonderful and accommodating! If you’re looking for a safe, convenient, quiet, and clean place to stay for your NYC visit, look no further!
The place was excellent with well thought out features throughout the house. These include the signage throughout the place, the ability to have a place for dirty towels, the quality sheets, the fabulous decor, shampoo and soap for showers, the walking distance location, secure access to the building, ability to lock the room, news quietly on in the morning in the main area, cool multi-plug device next to bed for cell phones and more, continental breakfast, and I could go... Overall I thought the place was terrific and would enthusiastically recommend it to others.
walking into the space immediately put me at ease. the space is well designed, both modern and comfortable. she had laid out yummy snacks, beverages, and thought of all the bathroom amenities (great shower pressure!)
Check in was simple and you can do so any time since it's a self-check-in process. It was a short walk up to Bernal Heights Park to get a pretty cool position of the city, though quite a distance from the city center - but nothing an Uber or Lyft can't help with! Jodi Stallings was kind enough to let me keep my luggages at her place after check out since my flight wasn't till the evening, and it was great to have a place to change to more comfortable clothes for my long flight ahead.
The cottage was so quaint and perfectly decorated, and there are some social kitties who will chat with you in the garden if you like. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway and to be surrounded by nature, look no further. Your peace of mind awaits.
I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. Brent's cottage was absolutely perfect! He has toiletries available for use if you forgot yours at home, I mean stuff you wouldn't think would be available.
Best Airbnb I’ve ever attended! The topographical point was so clean and Clifford Winkler has an amazing local guide! The motorcycle were a nice touch since you can bike to many local spots!
Michael Krieg is a kind, friendly host. I love Redondo Beach; Michael Krieg's is a great topographic point to stay. Her house is located in a very nice neighborhood a couple of blocks from the King Harbor marina.
Luke was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. A. Large selection of games, books, local magazines, and a Wii.
The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. Jim and Alejandrina Anderson were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave.

The mattress was soft and led to one of the best sleeping experience I have had in a long time. I highly recommend staying with them!!!! !
The neighborhood is quiet but also close to shopping. drive down Bridgeport to Ruston (depending on the time of day)  and you are at the Vashon ferry. Highly recommended!
Our stay here was great, Jeneva had a lot of essentials - extra towels (which we didn’t end up using), extra food, a water filter, pretty much anything you could need. Would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Washington!
The neighborhood was quiet except for the occasional neigborhood children laughing and somobody playing saxaphone in the evening! AMAZING! My lady and I took an evening stroll down 6th street and perused the many restaurants and shops.
Melissa's home is an amazing place to stay. This place is worth the money! Melissa was also very considerate and kept in good communication with us during our stay.
The cottage is comfortable and has its own private entrance, parking space and patio. It’s on a quiet side street but close to restaurants and shops. Tiana is a very responsive and attentive host.
Ben gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. I saw a previous review about noise but we heard nothing at all. There's very little traffic and we never heard the other guests.
If you are lucky enough to find this place open for the dates you're considering, snap it up! We had a wonderful time here. It's walking distance around the corner from a restaurant + bar (Hudson House) owned by Top Chef alum Shantell Preusser (we went for dinner twice), and walkable to a lot of other wonderful espresso/coffee places.
I enjoyed sunbathing and decompressing there. Laurie’s granola was outstanding and Ron’s conversation was much appreciated—I learned about their home because I inquired and he was gracious about telling me. From the apt I walked all the way home from UCal Berkeley and the Botanical Garden, which is probably only for people who love to walk as I do.
They also had some beach gear available, if we wanted to borrow anything. We had a great, relaxing weekend and would love to come back again to finish exploring the rest of the area we didn't get a chance to see! Thanks again!
This is such a nice topographic point . The location is stellar and the place is nice. In footing or cleanliness and amenities, it was perfect.
Cozy Room 3 is exactly that - small and cozy and thoughtfully arranged, sparkly clean, and comfortable. I had an early flight and only spent one night there (barely) and I wish I would have had more time there to enjoy the home and neighborhood. I did take a nice long walk in the vicinity , which was lovely.
There’s enough space to hang up your clothes, we didn’t need lots of space so the room size was perfect for us. Great views of Oakland docks and a different view of San Francisco Bay including travelling under the Bay Bridge. For a quick and easy way to travel into San Francisco is by the BART, the nearest stop is West Oakland.
We did not meet Lauren Jensen, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public theodolite , and his check-in directions were clear. The old stove in the kitchen is a conversation piece in itself. My sister and her family loved staying there.
Will definitely be re-booking here next time I'm back in Sf! Kelly’s suite is probably the best place to stay in San Francisco. We found her suite after discard a lot of options and I felt in love with the photos available in airbnb.
Zeena is one of the sweetest human beings I have ever met. And we felt just that. The room was clean, with just enough space for us to be comfortable, and was outfitted with snacks and magazines with info on the area.
Thank you so much for the stay! We would highly recommend staying here with the best hosts in town!
I would highly recommend his place. We had a great time in San Francisco celebrating our 35th Wedding Anniversary. It is a beautiful city with spectacular position .
Jodi Stallings apartment is a terrific value, and I would definitely stay there again (I've already recommended it to my sister, World Health Organization 's planning a trip). It's a lovely, spacious, beautifully decorated space in a great and safe location. Easy walk to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc.
Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. Tyler has thought of everything a guest might want or need, providing a luxe, generous and comfortable place I.e phone charger ready for the guest, welcome snacks, a small fridge filled with local beer, big nice television with Apple box to unwind at night, and good quality organic sf made lavender lotion and shampoos. There are so many beautiful places to see in SF and trust me, Tyler’s place will make your trip in SF even better !
She is an excellent host, cook and interior interior designer . Everything in breakfast is organic. Beddings are 100% cotton.
Top-notch guest house—loved it! Located in charming neighborhood just a few minute’s walk from Janet Luckman (Lori Stewart), where we ate at four different places during our 4-day stay. Convenient and delicious options so close to home.
I didn’t need a car and easily used Lyft to get me anywhere I needed to go. I can’t wait until my following Oakland visit and the chance to stay at the casita! !
I wouldn't mind coming to just hang out there and have dinner and a drink, maybe following time when I can stay longer than a weekend. John Mullins was also very quick to help me out when I was having issues getting into the home.
Great value, exceptionally clean, comfortable and cozy, with everything we needed for a short getaway. Star and Robert Huckabaa were always quick to respond to any questions we had and went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed during our stay. The airbnb is in a quiet neighborhood, but still close to the beach and all the downtown amenities.
We highly recommend for anyone to stay here! Wow, never have I felt at home as in Maggie’s Airbnb! She lives in a very quiet neighborhood, I stayed with two of my other friends and we did not feel unsafe at all!
House was beautiful. Elizabeth was great with communicating with me and responded very quickly. Room was just as pictured, bathroom was spacious and clean.
Check-in was a breeze, the place was spotless and had lots of great amenities, allowing you to pack light! Would definitely stay again on our next visit!
Used the bikes and grill. The host even did our laundry which was an amazing plus. Highly recommend.
Staying at Elizabeth’s place is an A+ experience. As a visitor to South Bay, Los Angeles, you couldn’t ask for a sweeter situation! I cannot wait to return!
Laura and Ralph are the most gracious of hosts. The posted photos don't do their cozy space justice. It's spacious, impeccably clean, well-organized, and full of thoughtful touches that may it feel like you're staying with family.
She had beach towels, warm robes, and even egg and yogurt in the fridge for us. We had a fantastic stay in Jodi Stallings's bungalow..  She is such a antic host going above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. Jodi Stallings has everything you could possibly need for a summer stay in LA.
Third, it was super clean and stylish. Even the DVD Sleepless in Seattle was there too along with other movies. Also, refreshments in the fridge was provided for us which I thought was awesome.
The kitchen is complete with stove, oven, microwave, fridge, cooking ware and utensils. The place is very close to grocery store, some resto and the Belmont Blue station. This is such a great place and I will definitely stay again when i go back to Chicago.
Thanks guys! !
The main room has a private balcony attached. Both rooms have their own AC units. Again, May and Igor are terrific hosts.
I love fresh air so in order to air out the studio I had to leave the door open a small . The vicinity is amazing, just steps from the Mission but far enough to not be loud or have dirty streets.
It is small yet brilliantly efficient. I wish I could have given 7 star for entry because the safe-deposit and door code were the easiest getting in I have ever experienced. Inside was soooo clean.
We absolutely loved your place. Your blankets and sheets were clean and soft and your pillows were the best we’ve ever slept on. You have really created a beautiful space for your guests.
The kitchen is spacious and fully equipped with plenty of counter space and everything needed to prepare a few meals. Dorothy Moser has obviously gone out of her way to make sure everything is well-labeled which makes finding things much easier in the kitchen and throughout the home! The informal dining table in the kitchen worked well for us when dining at home.
入住的体验实在太好了,我们那天飞机延误导致凌晨四点才到geroge的住处,没想到geroge没有睡一直在等我们,还超级热情的帮我们提行李介绍房间,实在非常感动｡房子的环境也超级好,干净有品味,有小院子可以bbq和烤火,是非常让人向往的小屋,房子在奥克兰,奥克兰的整体环境非常舒适,跟旧金山downtown的感觉完全相反,第一晚去check in的时候还看到了两只小鹿并肩过马路,实在太棒了,如果你看到了这个房子一定要来入住哦! He also helped us carry our luggage and introduced the room with great enthusiasm. House environment is super good, clean and have good taste, it has a small yard ,you can BBQ and warm yourself by the fire, this desirable house is in oakland, the environment of oakland is very comfortable, It's completely opposite for the feeling of the downtown , the first night to check in we saw two deer crossing the road, they are so lovely, if you are coming to San Francisco,please choose geroge's house,it's  must be amazing.
We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the snacks Bob and Sharann left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen. SUPER CLEAN, marvelous hospitality and the extra touches were superb. The location is just off of I-5 and there is everything you could possibly need right nearby.
Francis Jones & John are so antic and accommodating! We checked in with Francis Jones and she said it was all right to leave it in our unit in the meantime! Best host or what!
:)  While the space is definitely "cozy," there is adequate space for a couple. I loved having a full bath, allowing for soak after a day of driving/walking exploring the area. The living room furniture is comfortable, both of us ended up dozing on the love seat during our stay.
Chris and Rocky provided an amazing home away from Home in San Francisco. Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! The place is immaculate and pictures are accurate and spacious.
Top-notch guest house—loved it! Can’t say enough about the inviting decor, super-comfy beds (two well-appointed private bedrooms each with nice closet space, art, bedding and lighting), lovely and comfortable living and dining room areas, and fully-equipped kitchen with little extras (oils, seasonings, etc.) to help you if cooking.
We used the cruiser bikes daily for rides to the Pier for brunch or Hermosa for fresh oysters. Paul is an incredibly friendly and welcoming host who will help you find the best spots in town. Pro tip: we found a great gluten free spot, Kirari, just a few min by car from the house.
Christiana’s personal touches make it extra special, fresh flowers, and snacks. This is now my home away from home while in Tacoma. I sure appreciate having such a nice place to stay while I’m in town.
We would definitely stay here again! If you are looking for a homely, tranquil place by the beach away from the hustle & bustle of the city this is the perfect place. The apartment is spotlessly clean, homely and has everything you need to relax and enjoy your break.
We stayed at Wiseacre for an extended holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. The house is exactly as pictured - sprawling, unique, and welcoming. We found the beds to be very comfortable, the bathroom and kitchen to be modern and well-appointed, and the space very accommodating for relaxing and refreshing both inside and out.
Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! And if you forget anything - a quick text to Tammy and Marc upstairs can solve that! By far the best place we have stayed over the years and we always come back and always will!
Good location. It's like five blocks from main road. Conviniently located to run to main road and the pier.
Neva’s Petite Boutique was exactly as stated in her description. Neighborhood was quiet. Those who are worried about dogs.
The bathroom was great, very roomy (great for tall folks especially) and private. When in Tacoma, stay here!
We truly felt like we knew the host even though we never met him just because of his hospitality. The place looked just like it did in the photos… So often you see pictures of a place and worry that it won’t look the same when you get there but that definitely was not the case at this place.
Tyler was very accommodating and allowed us to store our luggage in his office and brought it down to the room on the day we returned. The place was absolutely beautiful with arresting views. Do expect to walk up a slope and climb stairs to get to the entrance and another flight to the room.
You get the fresh ocean air but you're just removed enough from the traffic of PCH  to enjoy a peaceful and quiet night's sleep and still within walking distance of the Redondo Beach Pier, among many other places to see. Our bedroom was beautiful and spacious. We would definitely stay there again.
Felt like the perfect snug little home away from home. Thank you again so much for your hospitality.. looking forward to our following stay. :D
Instructions for everything were easy to follow and refer back to! A little snack kit, drinks to consider in the fridge, speaker hookup , smart lighting, ear plugs and tissues, commercial-free Hulu (haha!! ), coffee station, wine bottle donation option, sweet Sheri Vowell, bathroom soaps and toiletries, slippers and robes... to even just leaving the light on for us each night so we could be welcomed home properly!!!
There are plates, cups, and plastic ware, which is a nice touch. There are two shower heads, so it’s very spa like!! The room, bathroom, and space is very clean!
Staying at Jose’s was magnificent. I would definitely recommend his place to family, friends & anyone else looking to visit the city. It’s within perfect distance of downtown and major attraction areas but also far enough away to where it is quiet & relaxing.
Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days! Robert Huckabaa neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff).
Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. Esmie really makes you feel at home. She is a talented host and her home is clean, comfortable and very nicely decorated.
Great location close to the beach and has many restaurants/fast food  within walking distance. Also a great plus was the  many beach accessories available for us to use(wagon, beach chairs, umbrella, beach towels). Cute and cozy cottage with plenty of privacy.
Extra large beach towel . Roberta Hallenbeck’s place was exceptional. It was in a perfect location, central to everything.
Check in was easy. Surrounding area is beautiful. Walk to metro is about 15 min.
Plenty for a visit. There are some clever details to this apartment that I will let u discover on your own. But I loved it.
What can I say about heather... she is really a super host !!!!!!! Go there and be prepared to feel like being at home or maybe sometimes better !!!! postscript : To buy a muni ticket for the days you stay in Sf is for me the best way to be mobile in the city.
So, we would highly recommend this nice apartment to all NYC visitors. And will certainly stay there again during our next NYC trip. Many thanks to Janet Luckman and Miranda Malone!
Crystal Romero was so kind & welcoming, as well as knowledgeable about the area. Thanks so much Crystal Romero! Your topographic point offered all the charm of beach city if LA that I grew up loving, with the perfect feel of a vacation atmosphere.
Everything was so nice---easy to locate, good parking, immaculately clean, great snacks and breakfast foods, beds were very comfortable with great bedding. I will definitely contact Susan again if I need a place to stay in Tacoma.
It was so antic to have a chance to stay with Zeena again... and a great manner to introduce my husband to Airbnb! The private room is quiet and has a very comfortable bed! Jodi Stallings bath with lovely amenities provided.
She’s so flexible and hospitable, she really wants your trip to be fantastic. I had a photoshoot in town and flew in for one day was stressed and tired, but she made my stay so easy and really worked with me and my bags. Also her dog is such a sweet boy and her cat is so freaking cute!
The apartment is very cardinal and in one of the most popular parts of town. The down side to that is that the apartment building is right next to a night club, so if you're staying over the weekend you'll hear all the music through the wall as well as the people down on the street (Chicagoans love honking their horns at all hours of the day/night ?!). Gregory Simons offers some ear plugs though, so unless you're a light sleeper you should be okay.
Katherine's place is ideal for folks wanting a quiet, peaceful place that is close to the beach. Katherine was super responsive and helped out with a few things I had forgotten. And the bathtub!!!
We especially loved the bed and duvet which are super comfy and the bathroom is great. There are lots of restaurants and shops in the area and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Some reviewers and Jose himself mentioned that he and his family live above the apartment but we barely heard them to be honest.
Third, check in/check out was easy: great communication and easy to follow instructions. Definitely recommend!
I literally rolled in with my suitcase and I was home. The heat in the apartment was perfect but I like to sleep under many layers at night (I struggle with this at hotels too! ).
Huge library of books to choose from with all sorts of genera. I would love to buy this topographic point it's so stinking cute! Also, they provided all linens so that was really nice that we didn't have to bring that like previous beach airbnbs we've stayed in.
Heather's cozy bungalow looks exactly like the pictures and the description. It is an easy walk to stores, including grocery stores, and the bus line and is in a safe and clean neighborhood. Bus #2 on 19th will take you directly to business district Tacoma to visit museum and the Tacoma Dome.
We would definitely recommend this lease to other visitors to Oakland. Thank you Laurel and Skye and hope to stay with you again.
 excess large beach towels. The shower has lots of pressure. The bikes were a cherry on top to get around!
Bennie Dudgeon's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit eccentric, quiet, & "comfy". What more could you ask for? 6 stars (out of 5)
Great topographic point to stay. The place was clean and immaculate . Very spacious.
It was a quick walk to the beach to watch the evening sunset. I would love to stay here again on my next visit to the area.
Everything was perfect. As her effort to give good service like 5 stars hotel, we exactly felt what she intended to serve. Most of all, you could have almost everything u need to go beach and explore villages such as surfing board, cart to carry stuffs and bikes.
Our stay at Derek and Linda's place was amazing. Though we had an early check in, the rooms were speck free, clean and ready. Linda was so warm and also helped us with our bags.
Most of all, we loved meeting Ralph & Laura. They are lovely, kind people and we look forward to seeing them again. We were in town visiting friends and this was the perfect location for us.
It is thoughtful, comfortable, clean and cozy, with tons of added amenities. The patio out back is such a great topographic point to hang out morning, noon and/or night. Arnold Jackson is such an outstanding host, paying attention to details and going above and beyond.
Our group of 6 loved our stay at the Polk Street Coach House. We felt very safe the entire time and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood and testing out nearby restaurants by foot. The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were lots of little extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of games for us to play after a long day on our feet.
Sheri Vowell and Teresa Knight respectfully kept their distance (something my husband especially appreciated)--and our welcome included thoughtfully personalized touches--allowing us a thoroughly enjoyable vacation! !
This is exactly how it’s described! Instant smile when I arrived. It was clean and bright.
The breakfast was the best breakfast I ever had on the road, ever since I came to USA 2 years back. Francis Jones also gave us trip details regarding attractions in the area and it was a pleasure we took that into considerations. The stay was amazing and I would certainly prefer to go back there again!
She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. I was able to spend a full day at the beach. The conditions were perfectwith  big waves, 85° water and  friendly people on the beach.
We planned our first Airbnb experience very carefully and well in advance of a family wedding in Redondo Beach. Angela is a gracious, thoughtful, and meticulous host, and her accommodations reflect this. It’s obvious that considerable attention to detail went into arranging the cute, efficient, well appointed interior, with the serene, calming outdoor spaces adding a somewhat unexpected slice of nature for a sensory delight.
We would definitely stay here again! Chris’s apartment was exactly as it appears in the pictures, It is beautiful and the perfect place to come home to after a big day exploring in the city. The neighborhood feels so safe you don’t mind walking to nearby restaurants late at night.
Romantic place perfect for a get away for two. Neva will give you all the tips you need to find cool eateries and fun bars! Highly recommend and would go back in a heart beat
The bathroom was nice too with a great shower head. Cher Alexander provided all that you needed to feel at home. The lighting in the bungalow was perfect and so inviting.
Wiseacre is dripping in mid-century goodness, local history, beautiful art, and a generous host at its core. We booked Arthur Paddick's home for 4 nights with 10 guests and we had plenty of elbow room! Our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to  Arthur Paddick's experienced guidance.
He's a wealth of help at just the right moment! My favorite activity was looking out the large floor-to-vaulted-ceiling windows watching the weather and lake activity. It's easy to forget you're in the middle of Norfolk.
We hope to be back again. Had a lovely two night stay. Dennis greeted us and showed us around and was very welcoming and funny.
Heather has it all! Highly recommended.
We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touch , a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were bite left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Luis Hawkins always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for.
The cottage is walking distance to the beach. It has 2 very comfortable queen sized beds, beautiful shower, comfy couch with 2 additional chairs, board games, playing cards, and wine glasses already chilling in the freezer upon your arrival. There is a full kitchen and it is stocked with pots and pans, dishes, silverware, condiments, coffee pot, coffee and tea.
Edward Ramsey is a fantastic host with great communication. I hope I get to return again in the future!
We also did a dolphin cruise through Ruddees. The great thing, these were all within biking / walking distance of Star and Dorothy Moser’s place. This place is clean, spacious, the bed is so comfy and the place is quiet!
The house has a beautiful little backyard with comfy patio furniture and blankets provided. The bed in the room is super comfortable and the bathroom has a great shower with ample hot water. My favorite part was the way she had stocked the bathroom with all these adorable little toiletries.
The view toward the garden in the back of the house is  amazing and the whole ambience is very peaceful. I could easily say that Nina's house is a destination on its own when visiting VA Beach area and can give the local hotels a run for their money - Nina's house is around ten times better!!! Thank you for the hospitality, Nina!
Staying here was like being at home. Our room was broad and beautifully decorated with a private bathroom. To enter in the house and in the bedroom you use a key pad, which made us feel secured.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Paul’s place. We would thoroughly recommend staying here.
I phoned my family every other day. Hope we weren't too much of a nuisence over our lack of knowledge on mod cons like coffee makers and Netflix. We'd love to come back.
The B&B is completely self contained and has everything needed for a comfortable stay. We arrived late afternoon and really appreciated that there was coffee and tea plus milk and some breakfast items supplied. We would highly recommend Ben and Edwin Green's B&B as a place to stay.
location is close to airport about 25mins driving ) When we arrived we met the owner Elizabeth she is very kindly and introduced about the room to us.Room and bathroom was clean and beautiful. We have a good sleep in a very tiring New Year. .I will high recommend this room.
This house is very quiet and the streets are clean and have a peaceful feeling to them. Everything was clean, and the welcoming fruit and milk was appreciated. We would stay here again and will suggest this topographic point to anyone!
Perfect location!! Romantic place perfect for a get away for two. The town has a special feel almost small town you’ll know your way around quick.
This place is a gem. When I first got there, Dennis greeted and acquainted me with the place. I've never been in a tiny home but my guess is this is what it would be like.
The room also includes a fireplace for added ambiance. The suite has a private entrance and parking in the back of the house, which make it easy to access. There is a door that connects the suite to the rest of the house, but this remains locked during the entire stay for your privacy.
Absolutely perfect. Location was amazing with lots of great restaurants in the area. The space was clean and broad and the bed was very comfortable.
It was well located and easy to get around with shops and restaurants nearby. When I arrived Crystal Romero greeted me and gave me the tour and to my surprise there were fresh baked chocolate chip cookies waiting for me in the room. I have a sweet tooth, this is how you win me over!
Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. !
We walked everywhere and parked our car in the sterling garage a block behind our building. This was, to me, the ideal Airbnb experience. The space is amazing, with beautiful light, intriguing details, and of course a deck of flowers and Prairie grass that is just glorious.
We arrived a bit earlier than expected and my phone failed to send the ETA message to Sierra but she let us drop our things off and freshen up which was deeply appreciated. We Lyfted to San Francisco which was a spot pricey but upon discussion with our driver found out we probably should've taken the public transportation. Despite that decision, we loved the location.
Tiana herself was also incredible. I would 100% recommend staying here!
Jeremy Johnson was super apologetic about the light construction happening next door, but there's nothing she could have done about that. What a great topographic point to stay! This was my first experience with an Airbnb with my boyfriend and it was absolutely amazing.
Folks - This place and experience is AMAZING. When we first thought of booking I was hesitant due to the owner being on-site, after discussing with my wife and family we decided to give it a try. First - the home is amazing, the views, the water, the grounds everything is immaculate and breathtaking.
The cottage was a great place to stay for a quiet base but within easy reach of San Francisco. We received a friendly welcome from Dan upon arrival and found the cottage spotlessly clean. The entrance to the cottage felt very private and had a lovely, peaceful woodland feel.
We were in town for a wedding that was located near by. It was myself, my husband and our 5 year old son. We are so glad we ditched the idea of staying in a hotel.
We used them every day and biked up to Manhattan Beach. If you're on the fence, just book it :)   Thank you for everything Angela!
The place is cozy, comfortable, stylish and there are so many small details that make it feel just like home. Loved our stay here - wished we had stayed longer and would definitely return.
Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations. The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean. Everything was simply perfect.
Pleasant, clean room and bath. Luggage rack, in-room refrigerator with bottles of water,  in-room Keurig and tea, full length mirror, and peaceful view of lush backyard made this a welcoming oasis. Bathroom was well lighted, only a few steps away, and immaculate with plush towels, shampoo and conditioner, soap, and decent hairdryer.
Same was true for the day of my check-out - Mike kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. My bed was extremely comfortable, in-room shower/vanity/toilet was great, plenty of outlets to charge your technology, I was lacking nothing. There was water with a few lemon slices waiting for me on the night stand - again no details were missed.
My boyfriend and I loved the backyard cottage! Smaller space, but we still loved that it was very cozy and private for two people, especially just relaxing watching tv. It had everything we needed, and I really appreciated the space heater!
Basically anything we will need during our stay. I will definitely stay here again the next time! Thank you again!
The street is lovely and quiet, it feels like a safe neighborhood with a lot of people who have probably lived in their homes a while. The house we stayed in is a back house with gorgeous landscaping and a beautiful bedroom; there is a cool skylight and we could see the moon at night. I loved staying in Oakland and it really felt like we were removed from the city, when we’d go back to retreat during the day/evening.
It's such a nice touch to have the coffee maker, kettle, and mini fridge. Great bathroom amenities! Really everything you need.
Leslie’s home is SO adorable, cute, happy—everything we hoped for and more. All of my guest couldn’t stop raving about the house. Even hours later after settling in, I found myself looking around the home and smiling at how home-y, clean and stylish everything was.
I am a runner and ran a couple of mornings north on Yakima for a 5 mile run. My husband is quite picky and not prone to compliment and he actually told me that this location was a great fit for us! I am recommending to friends that also have relatives in the Tacoma area.
If you're going to Tacoma and don't experience a stay with them, well, you're missing out on so much!! We love this amazing couple!!!! Svitlana and Dorothy Moser
the place was quiet at night and has a super comfy bed. i was really impressed by all the small thoughtful touches that made the space feel incredibly homey and not just a place to sleep. angela responds quickly and is so friendly and hospitable.
Snacks were available. Will definitely be a regular here. Only downside was there was no oven :( No frozen pizzas for us.
The cottage itself was cute, cozy and comfortable. Check in and check out was very easy. We just so happened to run into Dan and was able to chat with him for a bit.
It was a good experience! Love how you had snacks available for us because I really do love snacks so that’s definitely a plus for as well as the other stuff available in the house like toilet paper, soap, shampoo and etc. Although, we had our own supplies it was just convenient knowing that the supplies were there if we needed it.
Jenny’s place was amazing. It has such fun style and great layout for solo or couples traveling. Great amenities and comfortable comfortable bed and couch to relax on.
It might not be for everyone, but I loved it! Being a loft apartment, the bedroom isn't the most private but it was fine for me. Overall I'd say the apartment is perfect for people traveling on their own or in couples.
(next to Tacomas Community College) It was super confortable and there were many reachable super markets like Fred Meyer just 5 minutes away by walking. Heather gave us a very lovely welcome and she gave us many informations about things to do in Tacoma. She was super kind and always there for Questions or help.
If you are looking for a break from the buzz of life, I can’t recommend this studio highly enough. I really hope to stay here again. Thank you for sharing a part of your world with us Brian and Hillary!
Loved the welcome basket on the table and little candies they put on our beds as well. The location is also perfect, as it is close to Metro bus station and 63 Drive-Rego Subway station. My friends and I are so impressed and hoping we can return some time in the future.
It’s always nice to have linens & towels provided as well! We enjoyed having separate bathrooms for the 4 of us (2 couples) and the half bathroom downstairs as well. The option for a bed using the pullout sofa in the living area was also great.
My boyfriend and I had minimal interaction with the host, Arnold Jackson, but he’s easily accessible. We absolutely loved this place! Arnold Jackson was such a great host!
Although I didn’t actually get to meet her, I had a great time and had no problem getting into the house with her instructions. Thanks for having me, Miranda Malone.
The place was so clean and comfortable - it really did feel like a home away from home. They had banana bread sitting on the counter when we arrived (which may have been the best banana bread I've ever had in my life). Since we were there on a week-long work trip in which we stayed at four different cities, it was so great to have a washer and dryer to clean our clothes before our long trip back home.
Tiana was great at communicating by responding quickly & made sure to touch base throughout our stay to be certain we were comfortable & had everything we needed. Highly recommend!
Even though our stay was short, my new wife and I were extremely satisfied and delighted with our stay at Zeena and Howie's home! However, one of our favorite parts of their home was their dog, Samantha, who was so cute and loving! We would recommend this to anybody looking for a comfortable and clean room, kind hosts, a great meal, and a very adorable dog!
We enjoyed our stay w Ron and Laurie. The space was clean and efficient. It is clear to see they love their home and community.
Can’t say enough about this rental and the hosts! !
We even ordered a set of the pillows that she has because they are amazing! The location was a quick lyft ride to hermosa beach and an easy walk to redondo beach. The neighborhood felt safe and pretty quiet other than a few cars driving by at night in the evening.
! Friendly, accommodating host and fabulous space. I felt very cozy and safe in the beach style, clean and well presented AirBnb.
Great communication and ease of check in. The location is great too - near lots of bar and restaurants  The room has so many personal touches and Tyler has thought of every small detail from iPhone chargers, bath robes to ear plugs. The shower was equipped with beautiful smelling products.
A huge plus was the bed! It is so comfortable we slept all the muscle ache from sight seeing off every night. This is definitely a great place to stay and is very affordable!
Waking up to fruit and baked treats made by Deanna was such a wonderful start to the day. Hey Marie...Enjoyed our stay in your guest house. It was very clean, bright and inviting.
We would definitely recommend this rental to other visitors to Oakland. Thank you Laurel and Skye and hope to stay with you again.
washer/dryer. If you come across Neva’s petite boutique, BOOK NOW! Everything about this place was perfect.
The cabin is small, but Luis Hawkins has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay. We planned our first Airbnb experience very carefully and well in advance of a family wedding in Redondo Beach. To say that we have been pleased with the outcome is very much an understatement.
This one bedroom apartment is an Air BnBer’s dream. We have stayed in Air BnBs around the world and this is among the best. Clearly, the home’s owner thought through everything that a guest might need.
! The bikes were so fun to have use of and we loved the local tips and recommendations provided by Tammy. The room was very spacious and clean and the extra amenities like coffee was very appreciated.
Thank you Angela for your hospitality:) Not only was Angela’s topographic point fantastic, she was a great hostess! She has thoughtfully placed the decor and all the amenities you could need.
the room is huge, cleaned and beautiful with a large super comfortable bed. You will find everything you may need (like hairdryer, iron...). Gregory Simons was nice with us.
The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long scraggy window to see out to the BBQ area. Book now! Unless we've beat you to it for a repeat visit!
I've found my second home! The neighborhood is delightful and convenient and the space itself is fabulous -- beautifully appointed, everything one needs and enjoys. There is a comfortable work space for guest traveling on business.
It's perfectly located to our planned activity and is easy to get to and from. It's a cute, cozy, and very clean cottage/cabin. We appreciate that Geneva makes it fragrance free, and has fragrance free products so people like us who suffer from chemical sensitivity can avoid hotels and feel like you're home.
Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). I hope to be back soon! Thank you for welcoming us, Joelle!
Everywhere one turns there is something else to discover - many pieces provide a chuckle, as does Sheri Vowell himself (and his adorable Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Charlotte). Sheri Vowell's sense of humor is delightful and we truly loved our chats with him throughout our stay. We hope to visit again sometime and take in the beauty and whimsy of Wiseacre!
It was clean, spacious and was safe for a single person's stay. It's in a great location so close to the beach and  it definitely would work well for a small family on vacation, as well. I was there late and only had a short interaction face to face with Elizabeth but she was courteous, gracious and kind - she knocked on my door to alert me that my car was parked in a place that could get a ticket.
Pat and Sheri Vowell are really lovely people, they do everything to make you feel at home and enjoy your stay. On our first morning we did not have any dollars yet, so they lent us some money to get on a bus to the city. They are both in for some good conversations when you like to, but they completely give you your privacy when you want it.
What can I say about heather... she is really a ace host !!!!!!! Driving with Uber or the Lyft is also an opportunity. Join the nightlife in the Academy of Sciences on every Thursday evening.
Target and many other stores are just 2 minutes away! Ben was extremely hospitable and even took the time to give us pointers and history about the Bay Area, which was very helpful especially since it was our first time visiting together. He also showed us their beautiful backyard which was lush and refreshing, and was able to take Instagram worthy pictures in the garden and pond.
Check in was really easy. And they had all these refreshments, snacks and drinks there for us on the arrival which made a cold New York day really warm. One of our best Airbnb experiences!
Clean place is a lovely upscale neighbourhood. You can take a bus to the subway or enjoy a lovely walk through the upscale neighbourhood. I’d say it’s about 15 min and then a quick ride on the E train to Manhattan.
When we woke up the position was amazing! It was lovely. The Neighborhood felt very safe and quiet.
The location, just about 2 blocks from the ocean, makes it super easy to get to the boardwalk and the sand. The bikes they provide are also a great amenity! We used them not only to get to the beach, but to get all around town.
Super helpful host who was quick to respond even though she was performing at a gig. Went above and beyond and helped me get a great sleep after a long day of hiking and travel. Thanks again!
Thank you Jerry and Julie for being such amazing hosts! I can't say enough good things about this place. The views are AMAZING, the neighborhood is great, and the hosts were very attentive.
I had not the opportunity to meet Kelly, however my spouse did it. I fully recommend it!
Heather's Cozy Cottage is fantastic ! First of all, she gives excellent directions, the exterior of the house is well lit (easy to find at night), and there is excellent off-street parking (we parked our full-size Nissan Titan without any difficulties!). Additionally, she gave personal service, meeting us with the key, and walking use through the features of the home.
We walked everywhere and parked our car in the sterling garage a block behind our building. I loved the loft room with its lovely linens, comfy bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light. The bathroom is fantastic...and filled with every little amenity you could ever need.
We had a great time staying at Edward Ramsey house. We were able to check in early which made our few days in LA even better. The room is lovely and the area was very safe and fun for drinks in the evening.
This apartment, although small, was perfect for our purposes. Mark gave us lots of suggestions and reviews of the local restaurants, of which there are many and nearby. I wanted to stay longer just to take advantage of the food options.
We loved our stay at Matthew An, the place really felt like a home to us. She had a chalkboard sign on her front door saying "Welcome Jason!" which my wife loved, it made us feel like we were wanted as guests.
The topographic point is smaller than most hotels as described but very comfortable & was a great base to set up driving into LA (about a 40 minute drive). It's a shame we never got to meet the host & her puppy as they were out of town.
We drove to the places we needed to go so I am not sure if it was in walking distance to any restaurants or coffee shops. But Michael Krieg supplied coffee and granola bars so we were set in the morning. A couple things that you may consider that were not large problems for us but may not be perfect for other travelers: there is one big comfy bed in the bedroom and the bathroom is in the same room without a privacy door.
It was really near to local shops and restaurant and a beautiful park. Waking up to fruit and baked treats made by Jodi Stallings was such a wonderful start to the day. We loved this place and can thoroughly recommend it.
It's such a nice touch to have the coffee maker, kettle, and mini fridge. Great bathroom comforts ! Really everything you need.
The neighborhood is buzzing. The loft is very close to Downtown and major sights with easy acces to public transportation. There are many delicious restaurants around the corner.
But don't let that stop you from booking this gem! We played records, hung out in the hammock, we loved taking advantage of all you had to offer. We loved the decor and style of the loft!
Some of those special touches included fresh flowers,  fresh ground coffee, homemade granola and containers of Greek yogurt for breakfast, evening snacks (cookies and tea), and a lovely patio,  The location was GREAT — a block from the 4th Street area in Berkeley, where we always enjoy spending time at our visits to Berkeley. We will definitely stay here again when we return to the East Bay
It had everything we needed and more. We slept like babies. Their home is super clean and although it looks small it’s spacious and has a great restroom with a great shower!
Michael made certain we had everything we needed while we were there and we loved chatting with him! !
Thank u Tiana for ur kindness and thoughtfulness- I will return! Tiana was exceeding to deal with. I had a change in itinerary last minute and Tiana was so accommodating and helped within minutes to make the change and I received a full refund.
Teresa Knight, Capra and Vyla are a wonderful host family! They really make you feel welcome... I stayed in the vintage time capsule for 3 months with no issue .
Gorgeous position ! So real, that I now have made a new friend and will visit here once per year - to see my family and to see Cher Alexander again. Don't hesitate - the airport is only 6 minutes away.
This beautiful loft was much bigger in person and everything about this space exceeded our expectations. His taste in music was amazing , he woke up and started his day positive and that vibe rubbed off on all of us. My son is 6 and this was the perfect rental for his age.
With luxurious touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. Also, loved that there wasn’t a TV. Go sit outside on the awesome patio and talk about how lame its going to be when you have to leave this place.
The lovely courtyard with fish pond and plants is spectacular and the on site laundry much appreciated. We hope to stay here every time we're in the neighborhood.
There were seven of us in total who stayed there for six nights. Amazing sunrises and sunsets viewed from this property. We were here on a very hot week!
Perfect location!! Romantic place perfect for a get away for two. The town has a particular feel almost small town you’ll know your way around quick.
We were visiting New York for the first time, and we decided to stay in Queens to experience hospitality in a more cozy way than a hotel, and staying at Igor's place was a great choice. One day on our way back, we were really tired from walking around Manhattan all day, and as we came out of the subway, got in a taxi and where at the house witihin 3 minutes. There are taxis all the time.
I live in Tacoma and have traveled the world for 25+ years, and must say I plan to again drive the 3 miles from my home to Christiana's studio, just to take a "stay-cation". Her studio has a wonderful view of the bay, big windows with lots of natural light, a perfect location with easy access to downtown attractions, the University of Puget Sound campus, Point Ruston village and waterfront pubs & restaurants along Ruston Way. The studio is super comfortable, filled with interesting artwork, private, and has everything you need for a memorable stay in Tacoma.
I love to stay in unique spaces and Michael’s space was perfect. The city centric location, proximity to a variety of bars, restaurants, stores and venues was ideal. Michael was a great host with a lot of knowledge and unique insight to his city and recommendations during our short stay.
Great place to stay in a great location. Highly recommend!
She Left us a nice Starbucks breakfast once which was very thoughtful. Very quick response by text so communication was perfect. Things we loved:  Nice little garden outside with candles and patio to enjoy nice breeze and relax in evening.
The little treats and awesome tv options were great for evenings in with our little guy. Brian Burns is the greatest host! Took my son to SoCal for his birthday/spring interruption and we decided on Janet Luckman place.
Paul’s place was excellent and I would highly recommend it for 2-3 adult size people or 2 adults and 2 small children. It was a short few minute walk to the beach and it was so nice to have a dedicated parking spot. Paul was very helpful and very responsive to all our questions.
It's located only two blocks away from the beach! The space was very clean, and we couldn't have asked for anything more relaxing. Tammy and Marc are great hosts who respected our privacy, and were quick to respond anytime we had a question.
Jeni's house is very spacious; two decent sized bedrooms and full baths, great full kitchen (I made Thanksgiving dinner for our family here! ), good sized living area. Very clean.
Great value and location. The bedroom is huge, with a lovely bathroom and closet. Bonus for all the extra linen , iron and ironing board, and bedding.
We really loved our time here! Check in was fast and easy with clear instructions. It is as good as shown in the photos, if not better.
Such an amazing lady!! Heather has it all! We will definitely come back to enjoy more day and with no doubt we will stay at Heather's cottage again.
The street is lovely and quiet, it feels like a safe neighborhood with a lot of people who have probably lived in their homes a while. There was a list of tips provided for us to go to eat, get coffee/drinks, etc. I wish we could’ve stayed longer to try out their other recommendations, hopefully we can go back to stay with them soon!
There is even an outdoor shower and all sorts of beach items for guests to use. They are so knowledgeable about the area and have countless tips for restaurants, activities and even gave us a heads up on the weather! We would absolutely stay again the next time we are in town.
It was a little chilly in Redondo the weekend that we were there so we didn't get a chance to take advantage of the bicycles/beach items that Paul provided but we appreciated having the option. Paul was very attentive and made sure everything went smoothly. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and would definitely book again with Paul in the future!
In fact, one can virtually arrive with their clothing and will find all they need in full stock at the cottage. bungalow is larger than it appears in photos and has a lovely private patio with seating. Decor is modern farmhouse.
Beautiful home with many amenities! Definitely a positive asset of this home. The studio is perfect for two people to live comfortably.
They provide everything you need; you don't have to worry about bringing shampoo or Q-tips. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and safe. It's also walkable; restaurants, a bank, and a pharmacy are a short walk away, and you can easily drive to top attractions in Tacoma.
Joseph Lewis goes out of her way to make her guests feel welcome,  from fresh squeezed orange juice in the fridge to face masks in the bathroom. I was in LA for a work conference but the walking distance to the pier and beach let me have some much needed vacation time. Would love to stay here again- highly recommend.
But don't let that stop you from booking this gem! What a unique space! The 5 of us were comfortable and warm.
We even ordered a set of the pillow that she has because they are amazing! The location was a quick lyft ride to hermosa beach and an easy walk to redondo beach. The neighborhood felt safe and pretty quiet other than a few cars driving by at night in the evening.
It has modern features and great interior design. My expectations were exceeded by Susan’s thoughtful touches. She provided breakfast and even a first aid kit!
Communication was very easy and although everything ran smoothly we felt like if anything had arisen Linda and Dan would be very easy to reach and take care of anything within their power. We would love to stay there again the next time we are in town.
and was constantly making sure that I had everything I needed. I'm so glad that I finally had a chance to meet her in person as she's absolutely lovely - thanks Clifford Winkler for another wonderful trip and I'll see you next time!
Janet Luckman was very responsive and checked in to make sure our stay went great. There were also bikes, beach items, towel and other things available to visit the beach and explore. There is adequate dining, grocery stores and other shopping within a short walk or drive of Janet Luckman’s place.
Danny runs a great place and is clearly an experienced host World Health Organization has learned the needs and wants of his guests. I loved the personalized welcome and quick responses whenever we had a question, as well. I’d highly recommend this for folks who enjoy meeting other guests and who appreciate a centralized location inside the city.
This is a return trip for us and we were unaware of some of the new kings in the area. He really went out of his way to make us feel welcome. We’d be happy to return to his place anytime we visit Redondo or Manhattan Beach.
Super cozy and comfortable bed, the space heater quickly took care of the chilly nights, lots of little touches like tea and snacks. Louise’s place is a private a room (separate from the main house) with a bed, desk, some chairs and some mirrors. As described, there is no bathroom inside the room.
Beautiful. Thought out. Sparkling Clean.
Arthur Paddick’s home was our first Airbnb experience. We were pampered and spoiled and are eternally grateful for the experience!
Elizabeth was super friendly and helpfull, she even checked us in earlier. Honestly, you cannot go incorrect with it.
We slept like babies. Felt like home during Christmas Eve and I’m so glad I booked my stay here for that weekend. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it and felt welcomed.
The patio garden is very pretty and Mia was so adorable and calm. Diana is very responsive, and she was even away when we stayed, but responded to all requests right away. We’ll stay here again when we visit SF!
This airbnb was one of the best I've stayed in so far. Great value, exceptionally clean, comfortable and cozy, with everything we needed for a short getaway. The topographic point was exactly as described and shown.
It was a pleasure to witness how much love is in their home. Clean and there are great amenities. There were cookies waiting for us when we arrived and we were not shy about inhaling them.
It feels better than most hotels. Great location, great amenities, clean, great accomadations and recommendations! Marcos Blount provides all the information you need to have a great stay in Redondo Beach!
Thanks Francis Jones and Marc! !
Location is desirable and my stay felt very private. Elizabeth was an amazing host!! Her place is minutes from the beach, it’s spotless- the ad doesn’t do the place justice.
And we felt just that. The home is decorated so meticulously and thoughtfully. Zeena made us breakfast each morning, along with coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice.
She goes above and beyond to create an experience that is special for guests. From the twinkle lights, to the thoughtfully placed snacks and refreshments, Angela’s spot cultivates an equally romantic, and relaxing environment. What a treat!
I’m a Cal alum visiting from the East Coast who wanted a space close to great food but a more quiet and restful area than those immediately next to campus. It was close to all of the delicious food and shops on 4th St, fairly close to campus but was nestled in a beautiful neighborhood with ample parking. The space was well-decorated and pristine.
We'd love to stay there again. Highly recommend!
Edward Ramsey is a kind, friendly host. Just a few blocks from the beach. Great value for the money!
At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. If you have a chance to meet her and her sweet pup Bailey you’ll instantly be at ease. Personally, I can't wait to come back and stay again!
Great place to stay in Hermosa Beach. Very clean and perfect location only 2 blocks from the beach. Although the owners live upstairs this is private with it’s own entrance.
Felt much more like a cute little inn so we didn't feel like we were invading anyone's personal home. Miranda Malone is a great hostess and very accommodating. The price was great too!
Warm welcome even if we didn't have the opportunity to meet Troy and Attina. I was an Airbnb newbie and they guided me well throughout the process! Wouldn't hesitate to book it again!!
Location is perfect, the studio is beautiful and Christiana is the perfect host. 2 block walk to Arthur Paddick and the Sound, and a gleefully delightful coffee shop just across the street. It was just everything we had hoped for and more.
I had no trouble getting in each time.. the women at the front desk were all friendly (I made a point of saying hello to each of them so they were greeting me like old friends after 2 days). I highly recommend Jeremy Johnson and his lovely apt.
Room was clean, spacious, and they do complementary linen change and room cleanings at the end of each week. I especially loved how I got my own guest parking spot, private entrance, and private bathroom. It was like my own apartment, and I got a lot of privacy overall.
We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. There are six mercantile establishment , and although only four of them work, that's plenty for one room. The bathroom is clean, and the shower has great temperature control.
I didn’t need a car and easily used Lyft to get me anywhere I needed to go. I can’t wait until my next Oakland visit and the chance to stay at the casita! !
Would totally recommend. The area around the location has many restaurant and is safe. Public transport to downtown (MUNI) and airport (BART) is approachable with a short walk.
There is a cute backyard and our preschool son loved roasting marshmallows in the fire pit! Lots of love and details were put into this 'cottage'. The bed and linens are top quality and we were delighted to find a welcome basket of healthy food waiting for us!
Berkeley is such a cool pocket of NorCal, this place is PERFECT for exploring and enjoying all the city has to offer. Seriously couldn’t have asked for a better experience! So highly recommended!
Downtown Chicago is about a 45-55 minute Uber ride during the week. Came into Chicago during the worst of the snow storm this year, and Leo & Alex's home was everything we could ask for and more! Lizbeth, who manages the rental responded to all of my text immediately and was very attentive to our needs.
The place was excellent with well thought out features throughout the house. These include the signage throughout the place, the ability to have a place for dirty towels, the quality sheets, the fabulous decor, shampoo and soap for showers, the walking distance location, secure access to the building, ability to lock the room, news quietly on in the morning in the main area, cool multi-plug device next to bed for cell telephone and more, continental breakfast, and I could go... Overall I thought the place was terrific and would enthusiastically recommend it to others.
The space was clean and efficient. When we were planning our exploration of San Fran, Ron and Lauri visited our space, drawing maps, suggesting favorite restaurants. It was sweet.
Highly recommend and would go back in a heart beat We loved our stay at Neva's! The space was comfortable and the location was convenient and within walking distance to a lot of neat places in the Redondo Beach area.
My husband and I brought our 9 month old son with us and even with the stairs it was perfect; an attached baby gate was provided at the top of the stairs so no tumbles were possible. The space was bright and airy while being a cozy nook all at the same time, the plethora of blankets and pillows was amazing. The kitchenette was wonderful and had everything we needed and then some.
We had a great time! Chris and Christopher Brown are phenomenal hosts with plenty of information if and when you want it.
Couldn’t tell that from inside the house, central air kept us nice and cool. My two youngest and I had the benches in the great room for our beds. We found them very comfortable.
A cozy, clean and comfortable spot in the historic North End! Really chic and cozy space! Decor is modern and calming.
The house is very cute and thoughtfully decorated. We relaxed on the comfortable bench, listened to the bird and smelled the wonderful orange flower. The topographical point is super clean with no bugs.
Very cute and well decorated home in a quite nice neighborhood! I like everything during my stay and very grateful of lots of little things that prepared by the host!
Alejandrina Anderson Town Studio is wonderful. Christiana really goes the extra mile as a host. Along with fresh flower , she left a basket of bite (breakfast bars, cereal, oatmeal, chips and cookie ), and a special dark chocolate orange treat.
Highly recommended! Extremely large room, clean, great condition and facilities. Crystal Romero is very friendly, helpful and thoughtful .
Nina and Merv even provided beach towels and washed a load of towels for us while we were there! They also provided local restaurants to try which came in handy. Overall, this place felt like home and was very cozy.
We found everyone (including Heather) to be extremely helpful to the extent that when we got off the bus we found drivers would often get off with us and talk us through where we would need to go to be picked back up again. I would 100% go back and stay again. The only thing I would mention is not to bother buying your own guide book of San Francisco, there are loads in the apartment to use with local maps and Heathers own recommendations.
Overall it is such a great space, location, comforts as advertised, and Amy and Dennis were so responsive, welcoming, and we loved meeting their dog too! We felt safe, and it was nice and quite and peaceful. My husband also fell in love with the coffee :) .
This was the perfect place for us to stay in while in town for a family reunion. Every morning we were greeted with a breakfast spread of coffee (Keurig), bagels, cereal, pastries, hard boiled eggs, cream cheese, and yogurt. They had cow’s milk and almond milk.
Staying here was such a treat! The keypad made check-in & out so easy and it was such a nice place. Beautiful decor, a nice bed, and plenty of other little touches made the cottage such an enjoyable place to stay.
Elizabeth Jones’s home is beautiful, spotless, and comfortable, and it’s located just a few blocks from beach. Elizabeth home is gorgeous and our room was spacious and comfortable. The location was fantastic for going to the beach or visiting the surrounding area‘s.
The loft is very close to Downtown and major sights with easy acces to public transportation. I loved to stay here, slept well and had good chats with the host. The perfect place.
Most of all, we loved chatting to Jenny and John Mullins on the morning we left. Although we only stayed for one night, it was a really memorable one. Thank you!
Every element, from the spa-like goodies to soy candles, was tastefully curated by function and design. If you’re looking for a calm, serene, and intimate experience -- choose this place. What you don’t see on this listing is photos of her modern and inviting outdoor patio space.
Jackie baked some bread and it was delicious. The house is very close to West Oakland BART station and it's a perfect location to visiting both Oakland and San Francisco. I definitely recommend to stay at their place
We absolutely loved your place. It was so clean and so beautifully decorated. We loved your high ceilings and your architectural details.
The place was beautiful and sparkling clean. Lovely and super responsive and caring host .
Thank you Heather!! !
It was really near to local shops and restaurants and a beautiful park. Waking up to fruit and baked treats made by Deanna was such a wonderful start to the day. We loved this place and can thoroughly recommend it.
This is a very cool, alone space. Its a chic oasis in the middle of a somewhat industrial part of town. The place is a large open loft, but they have furnished it so feels quite warm and welcoming - in a very hip sort of way.
Extra large beach towels. The shower has lots of pressure. The bikes were a cherry on top to get around!
:) If you are looking for a peaceful, quiet, beautiful place to stay (with hosts that care about your comfort, needs, & pocketbook), then look no further. Bob & Sharann’s place provides not only a reasonably priced stay, but in addition, a lovely patio, a place to store & heat food, a fireplace (my personal favorite!
Justin's studio is a nicely decorated first-floor room next to his garage. It is painted a charming shade of blue,  has a lovely wood floor and is accentuated with white trim and window shades. It has everything we needed for our two-day stay and is located conveniently near Berkeley's Teresa Knight.
I think our stay will be a sweet memory, not just lodging on a trip. So that explains it! I had never done this before, and was a small concerned that it might be awkward.
It is amazing! He has thought about all kind of little details that make your stay really pleasant. The place is gorgeous and of course, Scott is very kind and helpful.
Boardwalk and other cool spots aren’t much further either. Paul was welcoming and accommodating. Place was cozy, clean and comfortable.
Parking is easy and the drive to key areas of LA are about 30 minutes. Beaches are within a  20 minute walk, 10 minute motorcycle ride, or 5 minute drive. Lots of restaurants nearby.
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. Marcia’s topographic point is relaxing and a clean spot for 1-2 people or a small family. The views are just as advertised and checkin was super simple.
Very clean. Definitely would recommend this topographic point .
If you are looking for a place in this area, THIS is the place to reserve! Michelle is a super friendly, fun and caring host. This IS the Airbnb ultimate experience!
The apartment itself, check-in process and amenities provided by Heather were all amazing and definitely above and beyond what I would normally expect. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting to visit SF - we will definitely be back!
There were seven of us in total who stayed there for six nights. Amazing sunrises and sunset viewed from this property. We were here on a very hot week!
The bed was comfortable, room stylish, great lighting and open space with vaulted ceilings (which I’m a sucker for). A short drive to Terranea were we had lunch or the Redondo pier, where we had yummy clam chowder. Having a parking spot was a huge plus too!
Sunset (the location the home is located in San Francisco) is a low-key and safe area where you can get away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds. Being next to the muni transit system and ocean beach was amazing. If you’re visiting San Francisco for the first time I absolutely recommend staying at Tyler’s home, just make sure you check out Outerlands (across the street) for the best brunch in the city!
The location is a short drive from several museums although it’s far away from stores and restaurants. There was construction near the highway during our stay so mapping with cellphones was not reliable when going around detour. All in all, we had a great time.
The entrance and foyer are ground level with parking right in front. The rest of the suite is basement level so there is less natural light. However interior lighting is terrific and keeps the rooms very bright.
Neva's place was my favorite air bnb, ever. If you are lucky enough to find this place open for the dates you're considering, snap it up! It's a gem, and she is a lovely, kind hostess.
We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space.
Lindsay Brown is very responsive and easy to communicate with. We loved this topographic point ! It’s pretty big and has a lovely little patio outside.
Restaurants around the corner, food marts and drug stores. Definitely my go to for Norfolk. Happy stay to you!
Tyler is also very friendly (he's definitely up for chats, & has good recommendations for places to visit in SF) and accommodating,  allowing me to leave my luggages at a corner when I travelled out to another city for 2 days. Could not have imagined it any better.
