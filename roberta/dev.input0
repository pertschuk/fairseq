There are even hummingbird feeders right outside the window which make for the most cheerful view. We had the best stay at Marcia's beautiful studio! You can tell she puts a lot of thought into her guests' visits.
The outdoor terrace is perfect for a morning coffee or breakfast and the pool right next to it is the place to be in the afternoons. The view toward the garden in the back of the house is  amazing and the whole ambience is very peaceful. Matthew An has thoughtfully provided all necessary dinnerware, towel for the pool and also juices, cereal boxes and other things for breakfast and snacking.
The place is conveniently located and the bikes she provides are a great way to get around town. I’m surprised that this place isn’t solid booked for years in advance. Such a perfect location and a awesome place to stay and relax.
We loved this place! Kelly was really easy to chat to and let us check in early and leave our bags late so we didn’t have to carry our bags around. Check in was super simple.
The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The vicinity seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather.
With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. We just wished we could have stayed longer!
Tiana's Beach Cottage is a prime example of why people are choosing Air B&B over traditional hotels. The access to and from the space is great, with private off-road parking and a  dedicated entry-way for guests. Compared to a $25 a night packed parking lot or tipped Valet where you'll still need to walk a good distance and then take an elevator to get to your room, the convenience of this can't be overstated for travelers.
This is a beautiful spot. Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. The decor brings an incredible atmosphere.
Traci is a professional chef, and she leaves out breakfast option that make 'continental' bloom . They had a couple of bikes for us to use, which made getting around town easy and enjoyable. We got in quite late from the airport, and had no trouble checking in.
Book this place now! The view from the patio is spectacular. Communication was great, Marcia got back to us within minutes of reaching out.
Very clean. I didn't expect the extras she provided such as full breakfast, robes, slippers  We actually spent a good amount of time here. Location is very good and safe area.
Elizabeth was a great host! When we almost missed our connector flight she was willing to accommodate early morning arrival. Luck allowed us to catch our flight and she was still available to check us in later than expected!
Robert Huckabaa and Attina were there as needed, friendly when we saw them and eager to make our stay fantastic, even giving us a late check out which was very much appreciated. The beach and parks are a short drive and the history of the area was fun to discover. Stay here if ever in the area.
Richard Batton place is a 20-minute walk to the waterfront, and about a $10-$12 Lyft ride to downtown, where there are plenty of fun bars and restaurants to choose from. We would certainly consider coming back!
Melia's casita is a wonderful place to stay when in the Bay Area! I have stayed at many homes when visiting family in the Bay Area, and this one was the most well-appointed, with thoughtful touches for decorating and amenities for breakfast, among other highlights. The view from the private deck is very lovely, and we had fun eating breakfast in the morning and watching planes taking off and landing at Oakland Airport.
Parking is easy. Elizabeth is warm and welcoming (and fluent in both English and Spanish). The accommodation is really good; great shower; spacious closets with lots of shelves and drawers.
Tammy and Marc were very helpful with everything. We found Tammy's Place and it was perfect for our needs. We wanted something close enough to walk to and from the Beach.
It has everything you may need inside the house, and it’s a great location. (about 8 min drive to airport, and very close to many restaurants) We loved our time in Brent’s cottage. One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located.
We highly recommend the place and we will come back for sure ! Angele is really warm hearted. We became friends and she even took me and my mom to Disneyland.
The experience here is truly seamless-- Tyler is immensely thoughtful, super responsive and considerate. I logged some hulu/netflix hours and loved the cozy bathrobes in the closet :) The bed is super comfortable, and there's every amenity you could think of. A antic alternative to overpriced/disappointing SF hotels for business travel.
We enjoyed the bikes she provides as well. Rayford Kelly has been a very caring, responsive and friendly host. The place is perfectly located close to the beaches but also close to restaurant and supermarkets.
The closet is large and generous to hold your suitcases, as this delightful room is more “pocket size” than the usual overly large hotel room; it’s more like an updated luxury room in an early 1900’s fancy city hotel (Algonquin in NYC, Benson in Portland, or a Westin packaged into a compact structure). Our only cautions for others in selecting this property are commonplace for SF hilly neighborhoods:  (1) it does involve at least a dozen stairs for carrying your luggage so make sure you can do that; and (2) if you are coming via car instead of taxi/shared ride service, do expect to hunt for parking that could be a five minute (and possibly) steep walk away in the neighborhood of often narrow streets, as this is in the aptly named Bernal Heights  — but as we said, those two cautions exist in most hilly SF neighborhoods (we lived in nearby Francis Jones for 20 years). Otherwise, you will surely be delighted by the experience and by Tyler’s detailed and generous hospitality.
Very convenient to lots of stores and the pier/beach. Would deff book again.
Room had more space than expected and provided great comfort, warmth, and amenities. Wish I could’ve stayed longer. Thanks Janet Luckman for a nice topographic point and easy stay!
I came here to Norfolk Virginia to hang out with my 4 grandchildren ages 13, 10, 6, and 5. If you need to stay in Norfolk for any amount of time, I can say to you, "Look no further than Wiseacre!". Here are just a few reasons why...
The beds and linens were super comfortable, very nicely made. We had intended to leave earlier,but slept in till checkout because we were so comfy. Nice shower and spa tub with a skylight.
Elizabeth provided excellent communication and high end bedding and mattress. You will enjoy her place as a base for exploring!
This place is great! The location is fantastic, parking makes life so much easier, and the added bonus of bikes and all the beach supply you need makes it even better! The space is super cozy, the bed is comfortable, and all of the extra touches made me feel right at home.
I would highly recommend her place for short or long term stays. Really easy walking distance to all that Redondo Beach has. Extremely clean and neat; VERY comfortable bed.
We really appreciated all the small details you put in to make this topographic point special. -Dakota & Trent
Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed amenities. This unit is for sleeping and (Website hidden by Airbnb) not like you’re going to sit inside in roomy comfort. It’s bright, clean and Marc supplies you with just about everything you need, to have a nice, comfortable stay.
The little touches in the kitchen. Travel can be exhausting... you are away from the comfort of your bed and shower. Not here... you are right at home!
The location was a quick lyft ride to hermosa beach and an easy walk to redondo beach. We only noticed because we slept with the balcony door open. We really enjoyed that.
I liked how they had put a Keurig, water and little brochures of local activities and places in the bookcase. The room and bathroom were nicely decorated, very clean, and they even provided shampoo/conditioner and little soaps! I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend these hosts!
Chris & Tim made great recommendations for us and we are so appreciative of the attentiveness. Next time we’re in the area, we would love to stay here again! thank you!
We are glad to have met her on our manner out and wish we saw Jesse! Thank you again Neva, we can’t wait to visit soon!
We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, snacks, water, and a fridge. Wish we could have stayed longer.
The shower was amazing and big. The room has two sinks, tv and a Balconny which is great. Elizabeth was very friendly and kind.
I think you never regret if you will chose Bennie Dudgeon's house. There is Food Lion not so far from house and you can drink coffee every morning. So I am sure you will love this place.
The post accurately reflects the place. Small but cozy. Best for solo travelers or at most two people who travel light.
BART is also only 10 minutes away , so you can't beat this place if you want to be secluded, but be close to everything as well! The cottage itself has everything you need, and was very clean and cozy. The beautiful gardens and hot tub were an added bonus!
Both rooms have their own AC units. They leave you to your own devices but are up for conversation if that's what you want. This listing is a gem, especially considering it's in Forest Hills, which is basically the Beverly Hills of New York.
We had a great time at Neva's place. We especially loved the little puppy World Health Organization came to greet us every time we left the building or returned!
Elizabeth Jones place is simply the best value for an entire space listing all around the Puget Sound. As an experienced host myself with the experience of hosting more than 2,700 guests in 2.5 old age , I can say that he is a professional and does everything exactly like it should be done. I learned about a lot of things I can add and improve upon after staying here.
With tons of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, bite and drinks,   bicycle , beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. Michael Krieg is a supper host! He is friendly and always available to give advice or just a chat.
Neighborhood was quiet. Neva’s dog, Logan, does not jump on people when greeting them. He is well behaved.
Janet Luckman place is like everything you want from a boutique hotel with none of the bother of dealing with other guests or the awkward encounters that sometimes come with them. There's one short flight of stairs, so you've got to be all right with that, but the building has a kind of Baker Street charm and the location is great. About a 10 min walk from the BART and a short stroll to lots of neighborhood spots.
! There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport.
If you are coming to Tacoma, you won't regret staying with Stephanie! The bed is very comfy and will be a great asset to you when you are done with all of your activities in Tacoma, especially since this is centrally located. I worked at the hospital and it is only a few blocks walk.
It is a hidden gem! Thank you so much for making our stay so fantastic ! ~Lynne and Patrick
It’s a beautiful space; unique style and I love that the bed is up in the adorable loft area. Very, very comfy couch and bed. The wine and bite were a lovely touch.
Lenora and Ernie are warm and hospitable. They offered clear directions and instructions and Lenora was accommodating when I texted to check in early. Their home is attractive and tranquil, with a lovely garden in back.
Neva was also kind enough to let us use the patio to host two of our friends for a little. Neva's place if great. I felt cosy, safe and very comfortable there during my four night stay in Redondo Beach.
The heat in the apartment was perfect but I like to sleep under many layer at night (I struggle with this at hotels too! Our stay at Natalia’s was fantastic and we’d come back again - it was as pictured but even better in person. We loved all the plants, the way it was furnished, a very unique space and very comfortable and clean.
Thank you is not enough Gloria! I have been traveling to Tacoma frequently for work and during a recent trip I stayed at Gloria's loft--it was without doubt my most pleasurable stay in Tacoma so far. The property is in the Theater District and there are a decent number of places close by for dinner/lunch/drinks.
The home itself was beautiful, spacious, well-lit, and clean. When we arrived, it was just starting to rain so Nina met us in the driveway and offered to help bring our bags upstairs. She was extremely friendly and gave us a tour to make sure we knew where everything was, including many extra pillows, blankets, and towels.
This space is even bigger in person than I expected from the photos! I cannot day enough great things about this little house. The next time I’m visiting LA, I’ll be looking to see if Bennie Dudgeon’s place is available.
We'll stay here again next time we're in town. We loved every minute of our stay at Roberta Hallenbeck and Jay's loft. It was charmingly decorated, with all amenities of home and more.
She was incredibly nice, very responsive, and made sure that I had everything I needed (and then some). Would definitely stay there again if I’m ever back in Redondo!
We realized right away that Miranda Malone and Edwin Green could easily charge twice the amount they are asking for each night, just because of the value of the place alone. Miranda Malone and Edwin Green were perfect hosts. I stayed with them for three weeks during my relocation to JBLM.
My family had an amazing beach week at The Carriage House! Bedrooms were clean, and all was comfortable. Kitchen area was great, stocked with all of the appliances, cookware & dishes we needed.
), coffee station, wine bottle donation option, sweet WiFi, bathroom soaps and toiletries, slippers and robes... to even just leaving the light on for us each night so we could be welcomed home properly!!! Just so much thought went into creating the amazing guest experience here. And the walkthroughs and notes were all so clever.
Warm welcome even if we didn't have the opportunity to meet Troy and Attina. I was an Airbnb newcomer and they guided me well throughout the process! Wouldn't hesitate to book it again!!
We had no problems with this. If you do not have a car, San Francisco is hilly and the neighbourhood here is no exception.
It is beautifully decorated and the hosts have thought of everything! I communicated with Jeni and she always got back to me right away. I will definitely try to stay here again.
Shantell Preusser was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area. We had great weather during our visit & loved looking out from the back deck each morning to see Mt. Ranier.
There's lots of automatic lights that turn on so you're never in the dark (as you walk up the driveway in the evening, or even into the bathroom!) And lots of locks and safety measures, so if you're staying alone as I was, you feel secure.
Fantastic hosts and will be back!! !
Gin and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! Nice map of the neighbourhood in the room. There is so much to see and do in Chicago, stay a while!
The queen bed was very comfortable, and the gas fireplace kept the cottage plenty warm. The french doors in the living room open out on to a very nice deck, with a view across the yard to the water, and across to the mainland. The cottage is at the back of the yard, so be aware you don't have an expansive view of the sound from inside the cottage.
Just steps from the beach, but close enough to any sights to see in San Francisco, I couldn't have asked for a better location. The home itself is perfect, equipped with a kitchen, sitting room, bedroom and bathroom. Not to mention the garden around the home are stunning.
I was flabbergasted at the size and  how extremely beautifull her decore was. Great place to stay. I would definitely come back here for future stay.
We would love to visit again :) It felt like a little oasis and escape from city feeling. The guest area is very private, from the room to the bathroom and shower.
Thomas George Place was clean, inviting, homey and safe. James Walker was an awesome host, responsive and super communicative. His topographic point was in a perfect topographic point in Redondo Beach and was hassle-free.
We were welcomed personally, and the suite included many personal touches that made it a very comfortable place to stay. If you like antiques, you will love it here! The room also includes a fireplace for added ambiance.
Though I never met Marc in person, he was quick and clear with communication. A block away from Dolores Park! About 10 min walk to the 16th St BART, which is convenient if traveling to and from airport.
Neva’s bantam boutique is great! The space is actually a little small, but it was perfect for just my Dad to stay in. It’s called petite for a reason!
Overall a great airbnb, as described, and would stay there again! Very comfortable and cunning space. GREAT bed!
I cannot say anything bad about this place. :)
They also offered a variety of tea and starbucks ground coffee--as well as sugar, creamer etc. A coffee maker and electric kettle rounded the entire thing out! In the fridge, a filtered water pitcher waits for you, already filled.
We’re looking to stay here again when looking for apartments before we move to Tacoma. Definitely recommended!
! Friendly, accommodating host and fabulous space. I felt very cosy and safe in the beach style, clean and well presented AirBnb.
Although we didn't cook at all just having that option available was comforting. When we were looking for an Airbnb the reason we liked Tylers topographic point was because of the kitchen. I would highly recommend his topographical point .
It takes 30 min. by subway (the nearest subway is 10 min walk). For us a perfect stay for a wounderful time in NYC.
We had a wonderful stay at Heather and JP's apartment. The apartment is very fresh and clean. It's lovely decorated and the kitchenette is well equipped.
I hope to return again one day, big thank you to our hosts! This is THE place to go when visiting Bay Area / San Fransisco / Oakland! Pat and Lynn are really lovely people, they do everything to make you feel at home and enjoy your stay.
This was our second stay at Susan’s place. We love the radiant heat floors and the spacious shower in the bathroom. We usually just have breakfast  in the apartment, but there are full-size, top-end appliances if one wished to cook.
She offers you your own deck with comfy chairs and a beautiful yard and a view of puget sound. Everything was spotlessly clean and she offers everything in her cute little kitchen you might need. She adds may small charming little touches we didnt expect and were so grateful.
Would definitely stay here again. Super stylish and very central. Only a couple blocks from the beach!
Their place is truly a respite. Especially suited for contemplation, writing, or long conversations with a loved one over beverage of choice while watching the sunset gently over the water. It is great to have a full kitchen and they leave nice notes and treats for the guests.
She made sure that all was okay during my stay. Christina is the most lovely person. She really looked after me, at a time when I really needed it.
Fortunately, Elizabeth was willing to lose a good night's sleep to meet us, after our flight was canceled and our final flight arrived so late. The bed was very comfortable, as were the pillow . Closet space is amazing!
The beautiful, modern guest house is thoughtfully set up for guests with everything including light switches labeled...instructions next to all appliances...plenty of cooking supplies and (Website hidden by Airbnb) conditioning...toiletries and comfy towels...plus plenty of visitor info and personal travel recommendations from the host. Loved the security features and felt very comfortable walking about though as in all areas of the city, you should use good street sense if venturing very far on foot. We did walk to the Jewel grocery store—which was an easy distance though I would be cautious doing so after dark (as you would do anywhere in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) special concerns).
The garden area, too, is lovely. The host also let us park our car in their driveway saving us from street parking. Thank you!
She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates.
Rayford Kelly was a fantastic host. Rayford Kelly's room was perfect for my short stay near LAX airport. It was clean, spacious and was safe for a single person's stay.
Marcia is a fantastic host with great communication. I hope I get to return again in the future!
Oh, and the bed was really comfortable - meant for sleeping in. We were up visiting our son at Cal and it was just a quick 10 min drive over. We can't wait for another time we can visit so we can stay here again!
I will definitely be coming back here. Great value for the monetary value . Highly recommend.
The location is great within walking distance to Redondo Beach and (albeit a longer walk) to the pier/entertainment area. Upon arrival, the place was clean and had a mix of drinks, coffee and other things to make us comfortable. Paul was very responsive and checked in to make sure our stay went great.
He also has a sweet dog that is extremely well behaved and let me love on him several times. That being said, as a single female traveler my room/ House was very comfortable and felt secure. This room has a common wall with the bathroom and a road with moderate traffic outside the bedroom window.
Perfect size to accommodate a group traveling along with a stocked kitchen! The only thing I wish was different would be that the location was a bit far from public transit or have an opportunity to park on the premises. Other than the small inconvenience this was amazing; highly recommend!
Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). It's on a nice hill in a nice neighborhood. Uber can get expensive, but there is express uber that can get you to the across the bridge for $10<, you just may have to ride with other passengers!
My boyfriend and I had a lovely time staying at Christian's! Leading up to the trip, he was very communicative, too, answering questions within minutes of us asking them. The house is located in Oakland near a train station that takes you to the heart of San Francisco within 10  or 15 minutes.
Just like everyone else said, the view is spectacular. This apt is sparkling clean and breathtakingly beautiful. I was in Chicago for a work meeting and loved coming back in the evenings to this comfortable, homely, beautiful apt.
She was also very fast to respond to any questions I had over Airbnb messaging. Neva’s space was perfect! It is a small very clean studio that somehow manages to have everything you may need.
I was in Tacoma for my daughter's Lacrosse games. I found Cher Alexander to be an amazing get away. It is beautifully decorated and the hosts have thought of everything!
The unit is sparkling clean with everything you would need and you can't beat the location! Soft pillows and sheets. Extra large beach towels.
and and plenty of complimentary teas, coffee, and snacks -- PLUS the most amazing, well-stocked snack bar available for cash/ (Hidden by Airbnb) . There are even hummingbird feeders right outside the window which make for the most cheerful view. The bed is cozy and the towels are super soft.
Everything was clean, and the welcoming fruit and milk was appreciated. My husband and I loved it!! If you are debating booking here, do it!!!
A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and liter system is easy to use. On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a motorcycle and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan.
His place was the perfect spot for me and my husband. I can’t rave enough! There’s an awesome walkable vegan restaurant for breakfast/ lunch and coffee shops from his place as well as an N train stop just a block away.
The backyard space was very zen and gorgeous and made us feel very comfortable and at home. Her new mattress was super comfortable and both my boyfriend and I slept like babies. We loved that it was super close to the beach and different grocery stores and shops.
It was quiet and peaceful amongst the city bustle below which you’ll have an amazing view of. Huge windows allow natural light and the kitchen which isn’t pictured is large, modern and well equipped. I plan to make this my go-to when coming back to the area, and wouldn’t hesitate to book again.
Chuck even provided an abundant bowl of candy in each room, I found this inspired. Needed a quick stay in Virginia beach as it was a last minute trip, found Chucks house and immediately booked it. Afterwards we discovered that he lives on the property, i’ve stayed in many air bnbs but never one with a live in host, so we were a bit curious / anxious as to how it would go, however it was amazing!
Very clean and comfortable place. Elizabeth was very friendly and nice to talk to. Very accommodating and responds quickly.
Just perfect. Check in was so smooth, and we were taken away with how much thought had been made in every possible way. The mini fridge had beverages and snacks, which we particularly enjoyed after our long journey.
I would recommend their place and I hope to stay again sometime. Peg and Jeff’s place was absolutely beautiful. Such a great location and is really central to everything.
Personal touches. Lots of beach toys available on site to use. Would stay again and recommend to friends.
The bed was very comfortable. Wonderful place!
Richard Batton’s place was the perfect home for our stay in Tacoma. Walking distance to some fun breweries & restaurants, but also a quick car drive , Uber, or scooter ride from others. Richard Batton was easy to get ahold of & had tons of suggestions available for things to do in the area.
The casita is small but has everything you could want for a comfortable stay. ), to the deck with a hammock and stunning ( web site hidden by Airbnb) was all so appreciated. I could not get over the special little touches everywhere like plants, candles, and pictures.
We will try to stay again when we return to Forest Hills. and rest after a long flight overseas. Also, the flexible check in was great.
The host are fabulous in footing of thinking about every individual thing that a guest could want. I loved this cottage so much that I booked again. It did not disappoint.
The loft was very spacious, comfortable and surprisingly quiet for being so close to the ports and trains. It's a pleasent 15-minute walk downtown along Pacific Avenue but there are also good food options (and a great book store) within just a few blocks. We'll definitely stay here again if their space is available during our next visit to Tacoma.
My friends and I booked Raquel Eastham's place for a fun weekend at VA beach. We also cooked all of our meals and Raquel Eastham would run the dishwasher and put away the dishes while we were away which was so convenient and thoughtful. He even had put out a individualized sign welcoming our group.
Jerry & Julie made our late (midnight) check in a breeze and were always available if we ever needed anything. But we didn’t ever have to bother them because all of the exceptional communication for checkin, checkout and how to navigate the home. comforts were all provided in organized written form.
Esmie's topographic point (Casa 2 we stayed in) was a dream come true Airbnb! Details: The bed was like a marsh mellow cloud from heaven, and I fell asleep so quickly I actually thought I was at home when I woke up! The whole room is beautifully decorated in a balanced, peaceful manner (there is an actual theme, versus random), that obviously was thoughtfully put together.
Neva's place if great. I needed to be nearby for work and this was a great place to stay. Near to the shops and travel links and close enough to the beach that I was able to get in a morning run along the sand each day.
We spent 3 nights at Chris’s studio apartment and think that the only valid description for both the hosts and the apartment is ‘fantastic’! The studio was spotless and provided all that we could wish for in terms of comfort and facilities, including a chance to relax in the garden and some very welcoming breakfast and other amenities. For us a special bonus was the superb location - less than 5-minute walk to the wonderful Golden Gate Park – a must visit - along with excellent transport links to other areas of the city.
The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference.
A great getaway spot! My husband and I took a few days together away from the kids to enjoy the beach & this place was perfect - cute, clean, and walking distance from the beach and almost every restaurant & activity we enjoyed during our trip. Star & Austin were great hosts and checked in with us several times throughout the visit to make sure we had everything we needed.
It also has a balcony that shows a view of all of Tacoma. On some days we can see Mt. Rainier from a far and that is a sight for sore eyes!
I phoned my family every other day. We both felt like we had a great time. So, a big thumb up from us.
Also recommendation are printed out for you. And even has an Alexa for you! !
It was our first time in Virginia Beach, and it has won over our hearts... and our stay at Star and Austin’s place played a huge role in that experience. Their place was super cozy and had such amazing amenities. Our favorite thing to do was to take the bikes out to roam about the city, stopping by cute local stores and listening to late night music jams.
There is an keyless entry to the apartment. 2 blocks away. There are many places around where you can have pretty decent meals and a pub where you can have a drink at night.
The space was cute, clean, and had good comforts . The place was amazing! It had everything you would need for even a long stay in LA.
I traveled with my mom and my kids and we were comfortable, delighted, and fell in love with the area. Walking to the many parks nearby, and to Taylor St for dinner and dessert - we even found a bit of our personal family history as 3 generations ago our family lived in the same area. Ken was a fantastic communicator and the small touches throughout the Coach House made our stay so easy and seamless.
It was such a warm genuine welcome. This was my 3rd visit to the little house and I'm already looking forward to my next visit! Bennie Dudgeon always goes above and beyond to make sure that each and every guest is comfortable - plus the extra touches are like nothing else I've ever experienced in an AirBnb!
Location location! A beautiful place very clean and everything you need. We loved  the cruisers included for beach riding... A fantastic host.
It felt like we knew him. Awesome experience!
Dolores park is spectacular. Truly the best Oatmilk latte I have had in a long time. This was a great airbnb.
• The bathroom was outfitted with much more than we needed. The towels were soft and fluffy and there were plenty of them. • The lights and heat are controlled by a Nest system with detector to turn lights come on and off as you enter and leave a room.
The walk in closet was awesome. We stayed 2 weekends in a row. We would definitely stay there if we were in the area again.
Joelle's space is beautiful and amazing! The neighborhood is lovely. Coffee shops, grocery store stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill).
We were met with incredible cordial reception , a beautiful space, a super friendly porch, and a antic location. We left feeling like we’d made friends  We WILL be returning!!! !
The breakfast! It was antic and held us over until lunch. We took the motorcycle to Berkeley campus and enjoyed the ride.
The best part: I was able to bring my dogs! Fantastic hosts and will be back!! Thank you again guys for making my family trip wonderful!
My husband and I were very impressed with Lia and Christopher Brown’s gracious hospitality and comfortable, clean apt.!! And, we LOVED their sweet pooch , Questa! She couldn’t be more friendly and polite!
The vicinity is beautiful. Fell asleep in an blink of an eye it was so comfy. During our stay we ate at The Good Stuff and Phanny’s.
Just a few blocks from the beach and Golden Gate Park. Would highly recommend this spot!
We weren’t prepared for a 12pm check out as we planned for 1pm per what was on Airbnb. Linda/Mike thought we knew it was a 12pm check out and when we told our hosts we thought 1pm, they did not rush us at all, even though they had to prep for their next reservations at 2pm. We did our best to rush check out as it was a miscommunication that was not on Linda/Mike.
Now I know why they call you a super host because your place was super cool! Also, thanks for giving us the opportunity to stay at your topographic point while in Chicago. It was a good experience!
Third, it was super clean and stylish. VIP parking spot was also available for your own personal vehicle or your rental. I call it VIP parking just because how close it was to the front door.
Brian Burns's sense of humor is delightful and we truly loved our chats with him throughout our stay. Brian Burns’s beautiful home and landscape is only matched by his own wonderful personality, we decided that we will be staying here from here on out whenever we visit Norfolk so long as the space is available when we do visit. Most everything you can imagine is within a 15 minute drive with some great options for lunch/dinner at an even shorter distance.
Thank you Jerry and Julie for being such amazing hosts! The home has cute little extras like candles, patio sets, board games and books for all ages. Amenities like shampoo, conditioner, towels and linens were all stocked and cleaned.
This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated.
Great location, great amenities, clean, great accomadations and recommendations! 20-30 minutes from Santa Monica, Downtown LA, and Hollywood.
Really close to the beach as well. I had an outstanding stay at Elizabeth's place. The place is exactly as described.
Street parking was easy over the weekend and it's only a 5 minute walk from the BART. My husband and I would both definitely stay here again.
My husband and I enjoy walking and looking at the local architecture, and the streets abutting the studio provided abundant opportunities for exploring the different building styles. He was quick to respond to any of our requests and gave good advice about visiting some of the sights nearby. On our last morning there, we had delicious croissants and lattes at Masse's, a little slice of Paris on Shattuck.
If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a bit tricky on the streets, especially late at night. We had an excellent stay at Tyler’s place. By the time we arrived in San Francisco, we were a spot tired from our road-trip from Vancouver, and so it was a real treat to have such a clean topographic point with complimentary snacks, beer, and HBO/Netflix for our first night.
Jennifer Merry and Ben are great hosts - great response rate during check-in. This was our second visit to Ben and  Jennifer Merry's place. We loved it last time and it was just as good this time.
The cabin is small, but Angela has it packed with thoughtful details that will guarantee a lovely, cozy stay. Couldn’t have asked for a better Airbnb or a kinder host. Thanks again, Angela!
It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. The morning I was checking out, I had the chance to sit and chat with Shantell Preusser on my way out while he prepared for his next guest. What a great, down to earth, knowledgable, compassionate adventure seeker Shantell Preusser is...I loved the narrative he had about the artistic and eccentric atmosphere that his  loft had to offer!
And there’s not many great choices since it’s Federal Way. No amenities really to speak of. Things like bathroom supplies, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips, bandaids, toothpaste or toothbrushs, etc.
Titlow Park is about a 15 minute walk and features bird-watching, playground and views of Tacoma Narrows. This cottage was so comfortable and truly cozy. We stayed with our 22-month-old son, and Heather had great accommodations for a young child.
The bungalow (aka OPC) is quaint and cozy, and it is the perfect size for any couple looking for a beach getaway! We absolutely loved our stay here. The location was perfect and we could walk to restaurants, trails, and the beach.
This place was great! Amazing view and perfect for snuggling! We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, snacks, water, and a fridge.
The place is perfectly located and if you are from Redondo and looking to visit then this will make you feel at home. Cher Alexander was quick to respond to every question we had. We had fans in the closet to use and beach towel and she even left bottled water in our room.
I had a lovely stay at the Garden Hideaway. Mishaa & Denise are excellent host . It's exactly as described - a standalone cottage/room in the garden, separated from the main house.
The beds and pillow are super clean and comfortable at Maggie's place. We stayed at Maggie’s apartment for 4 days. Such a cozy home!
The wide roofgarden filled with a hundred of flowerpots is the best location during breakfast and evening hang out . We ate breakfast there (when it didn’t rain)and drink wine on the  Sofa like an extended life room under the moonlight during evening with fantastic sound of Joseph Lewis’s music collection . From the roof top you can see the numerous restaurants and bars around , but Clifford Winkler rooftop offers the best location , so why still going to a bar?
We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing. Check in is simple and easy to complete. Arriving the topographic point was lovely and warm, music on, snacks left out, bottled water, tea, coffee and basic supplies on hand which really made it feel like home.
She provided a lot of info on where to eat close by, and where to shop. Overall, I highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a peaceful getaway. Marcia is a fantastic host with great communication.
The private parking lot in the back was a major plus and the area was very safe and trendy with tons of shops and restaurant up Milwuakee Ave. Ewa provided many different amenities when we checked in and lots of useful local tips. The room itself was decorated nicely and had VERY high ceilings which I loved. Even though the apartment was on a busy street, no outside noise could be heard from inside the apartment.
We mainly used the house as a base to explore San Francisco, travelling mainly by shared Lyft rides ( a nice way to meet the friendly people of the Bay Area!) We did have a full Oakland day as well, both in the immediate neighbourhood of the house as well as surrounding neighbourhoods, and another morning where we went to the awesome Grand Lake Farmer's Market, a short walk from the house. Had I had more time, I would spend more time exploring Oakland, where there is lots to do, and nicer weather than SF!
I loved this simple and serene space. The Wi-Fi at the farm is great too. Despite being designed as an open space, the layout of the farm is situated such that it felt really private.
I would give Dennis Steward home more than 5 stars if possible, what a perfect place to stay! This home is stylish, well appointed, comfy and incredibly clean. Location is desirable and my stay felt very private.
The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather.
Their space is incredibly stylish and really unique. We loved the garden area and enjoyed sitting outside to eat breakfast and relax. It is in an amazing location, within walking distance of so many great restaurants!
She offered me eggs and toast so i can make breakfast over the the span of my visit if i needed. I would 100% recommend this topographic point to anyone staying in the area and would come back!
We had the pleasure of staying at Wiseacre for a few days to enjoy some peaceful family time. Wiseacre is a beautiful, Frank Lloyd Wright inspired house filled with an eclectic array of art, history and personal touches. Chuck and Charlotte (the sweetest pup) were the best hosts.
Note that the bathroom is quite narrow and the unit of measurement is up a flight of stairs. Neighborhood felt safe and we had no trouble finding parking on the street or very nearby. The provided Keurig coffee and small bottle of milk, fruit & little snacks were much appreciated.
Great location and the 3 bikes he has for guests came in handy. Boardwalk and other cool spots aren’t much further either. Flawless place and perfect if you’re looking to stay in Redondo.
The artistic touches and the environmental concerns were a plus. We felt like we were guests of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. You don't need to bring or buy much.
Nevas place was adorable and so comforting. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was so luxurious. We are glad to have met her on our manner out and wish we saw Jesse!
At the end of a long day, grabbing a drink at one of the endless options of restaurants and bars in the area, relaxing in the huge jetted tub and then curling up in the sleep number bed is exactly what I needed. !
Oh on behalf, I couldn’t live without their outdoor hot tub and mediated room! Where do I begin?! My boyfriend and I are an eclectic couple, and staying in the artsy, eclectic unit of Steven and Sara’s couldn’t have been more perfect.
Easy walk to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. and a short walk to two "L" (subway) lines. My only issues concerned the overall air system.
Clifford Winkler was easily one of the best sweetest hosts i’ve stayed with! She was so thoughtful and made our stay so easy and comfortable. The place was also so beautiful and so homey.
Fantastic host, and the studio was clean, well-appointed, and very stylishly decorated. We stayed with our two kids this time, but we'll be back again for a longer trip to enjoy this fun property close to the beach and some great restaurants (try Mama D's, especially if you have kids. Excellent food and family friendly!)
We stayed at Wiseacre for an extended holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. The house is exactly as pictured - sprawling, unique, and welcoming. We found the bed to be very comfortable, the bathroom and kitchen to be modern and well-appointed, and the space very accommodating for relaxing and refreshing both inside and out.
This is a delightful cottage with everything for a relaxing stay in one cozy package. We were so impressed by the well-organized space and the comfortable furnishings. The location is perfect.
She offers you your own deck with comfy chairs and a beautiful yard and a view of puget sound. Everything was spotlessly clean and she offers everything in her cute small kitchen you might need. She adds may small charming little touches we didnt expect and were so grateful.
She and her family are such amazing people and made our stay a memorable one. You will not be disappointed. We cannot thank Nina enough for her amazing hospitality and kindness.
Great location close to the beach and has many restaurants/fast food  within walking distance. Also a great asset was the  many beach accessories available for us to use(wagon, beach chairs, umbrella, beach towels). Cute and cozy cottage with plenty of privacy.
We had lots of privacy and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. We were able to walk to a whole bunch of great restaurants and bars easily- this place is located in great area of Oakland!
Great place to stay. I recommend staying here if you’re visiting the LA area. It’s a short distance from the airport, walking distance to the beach, and walking distance to food and entertainment by the beach.
Elizabeth is an amazing hostess. She offers more than expected and she does a great occupation with directions, communication, and working to make your stay smooth and enjoyable. We will stay with her again!
We will definitely be back. Betty Maust exemplifies a super host! She is welcoming, and thoughtful, and spent our entire time there making sure we were having a great stay.
The room is huge, with a very large comfortable bed and great amenities. We'd stay again in a flash and would thoroughly recommend it if you are visiting Redondo beach which is only a short walk away, as are plenty of places for eating and shopping. Robert Turpen is a delightful lady and a perfect host.
Thank you Heather and family for an amazing stay. Especially demo! !
The grounds are spectacular and vast with something to peek your interest at every turn. The home itself is so incredibly spectacular with the intent of Frank Lloyd Wrights' unique architecture of bringing the outside into the home. Morning sunrise and evening sundown are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area.
Diana was the ultimate host! I typically stay in the same hotel each time I visit the East Bay for work. After this visit at Diana's guest house, I'm convinced that this experience was significantly better than any hotel I could stay in.
I don’t ever write the views but I was compelled to let you view review for Miranda Malone place. She lives upstairs but you never know she’s there unless you contact her. I would highly recommend this place such a joy every treatment self and very affordable priced
The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long skinny window to see out to the BBQ area. You can see the water from the main living space and from the porch, and you can walk down to the rocky beach itself at low tide. Chip's house is just across the lawn, but not visible from the cottage.
Best Airbnb I’ve ever attended! The place was so clean and Paul has an amazing local guide! The bikes were a nice touch since you can bike to many local spots!
The description of the apartment is very accurate and in the folder he has prepared, you can find any information you need about the apartment but also the neighborhood and useful tips for San Francisco. There is a 7/11 and another store within 5 minutes walking distance so if you need anything, no need to take the car. The apartment is also accessible by public transport.
Chuck was the most gracious, funny, warming, magical host. In our 4.679 years of dating this was the best place for us to retreat, recover, and nourish our souls. I will be back over and over and over again.
The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. Joseph Lewis's topographic point was great! First of all, the location is just as nice in real life as the photos suggest.
The place is smaller than most hotels as described but very comfortable & was a great base to set up driving into LA (about a 40 minute drive). It's a shame we never got to meet the host & her puppy as they were out of town.
The accommodations felt thoughtful. Elizabeth’s place was an easy walk to my venue on the beach. She was super helpful at getting me in the house and even had a gallon of water waiting for me.
Also, because this place is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood. I found parking in that neighborhood to be quite accessible. On my last morning there I had a lovely coffee at the Precita Park cafe which is very close...the food being served looked tasty.
This was one of the all right Airbnbs that we stayed at during our trip. We stayed at Tyler's place to visit San Francisco at the end of our roadtrip through the states. When we arrived we were allready briefed on how to check in and we also recieved some guideline .
Clifford Winkler’s apartment was exactly as it appears in the pictures, It is beautiful and the perfect place to come home to after a big day exploring in the city. It is so close to many amazing restaurants and cafes. Make sure you use the resource folder provided and eat at the restaurants suggested.
Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. Tyler has thought of everything a guest might want or need, providing a luxe, generous and comfortable place I.e phone charger ready for the guest, welcome snacks, a small fridge filled with local beer, big nice tv with Apple box to unwind at night, and good quality organic sf made lavender lotion and shampoos. There are so many beautiful places to see in SF and trust me, Tyler’s place will make your trip in SF even better !
The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Heather and JP are wonderful hosts!! Their space is incredibly stylish and really unique.
Tiana was very accommodating and was there to assist and help us with our needs and concerns. The beautufully clean beach is a nice walking distance (10 minutes) and the great shops & restaurants on the pier (20 minutes) as well. There is a clean, safe 18 minute wash right up PCH (5 minute walk) with friendly staff and customers.
The location was perfect for a beach view, but we we also used it as a home base when visiting other parts of LA. We would definitely stay again.
The home is decorated so meticulously and thoughtfully. Everything was delightful . Zeena has a servants heart and radiated love from the minute we met her.
Walking to the beach was no biggie for my bf but I will say as a heads up that if you are fat (self included), the beach is probably a tad further than you wanna walk, especially since the return walk is uphill. Excellent service. Good location.
We had a fantastic stay in Angela's bungalow..  She is such a antic host going above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. The bungalow itself is exactly as described in the Air BnB description as well as Angela creating an awesome setting each night. Top location in Redondo Beach close to everything!
We did not meet Christopher Brown because of our crazy tight schedule, however she had left plenty of helpful directions and instructions and was quick to answer any message. The house is sparkling clean, the room is lovely with plenty of space and the door room can be locked with a code which is a nice addition. Would definitely recommend staying here!
Plenty for a visit. There are some ingenious details to this apartment that I will let u discover on your own. But I loved it.
You can go to the Golden State Park walking. Everything is as described on the webpage. All the instructions are there and well explained.
We used the full, modern kitchen to cook several meals--we had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay! We even spent some time fishing on Lake Whitehurst which is located on the property. This was our first Airbnb experience and we think that Jodi Stallings, Charlotte, and Wiseacre have set the bar so very high!
Thank you! We will be back.
Just stayed here a second time. The room is IMMACULATE. And the location is fabulous.
The suite is completely updated with high-end fixtures, gorgeous natural light, and complete privacy. While there is no access to a kitchen, all of the best food is within blocks and within minutes of the front door. I was also pleasantly surprised at the setup of receiving my own key to the front door (I’ve only rented entire homes previously), where three private suites are all accessible from the main hall, and Cher Alexander’s private residence is an entirely separate entrance.
Perfect size to accommodate a group traveling along with a stocked kitchen! Check in was really easy. Crystal Romero was very quick to respond to our question .
This was a nice little place for a one night stay in the city. The space itself was really small (especially the bathroom) but it was nice for just one night and you better be comfortable with the person you’re staying with since it is very close quarters. Not sure if it is the hosts who live upstairs but be prepared for some noise, we heard a lot of stomping around upstairs well past midnight and up again early in the a.m. That didn’t bother us toooo much and we really appreciated the glass water bottles, option of having coffee in the morning, FULL LENGTH MIRROR is always a huge plus in my book, and a record player with actually good record options!
Lindsay Brown’s condo was a true oasis! Lindsay Brown’s place was exactly that - a home away from home. Everything that we had been missing about home (some space to move around, a real kitchen, an amazing bathtub) was found at this terrific Airbnb.
! fantastic stay! We had an excellent time and would absolutely stay here again!
Everything about our time at Angela’s beautiful bungalow was wonderful. Angela is so warm & has created a gorgeous private haven in Redondo Beach, which is a great location. Her lovely dog, Bailey, made it extra special.
Super cozy bedding so we all slept well. Paul's cottage is very nicely decorated and well appointed. He's added some really nice touches like little snacks and bottled water.
It was sparkling clean and stocked with everything you’d need from keurig coffee and granola bars to maps and information about the city. I ate at an awesome neighborhood restaurant Ardiana, great prosciutto di parma pizza and a yummy glass of Roberta Hallenbeck :) All in all, great location, nice people, super clean and comfortable, safe, and a fair price (hard to find in SF!). I would recommend their place and I hope to stay again sometime.
We loved the modern design and really cool efficient use of space and the tranquil garden setting. I just wish we were there when it was warmer and sunny so we could sit in the garden outside. Bennie Dudgeon was super quick in his communication and was there to greet us when we arrived.
I came here to Norfolk Virginia to hang out with my 4 grandchildren age 13, 10, 6, and 5. If you need to stay in Norfolk for any sum of time, I can say to you, "Look no further than Wiseacre!". Here are just a few reasons why...
Great location, great value, comfortable beds, large bedrooms. I wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. Mona responded nearly immediately to any messages, and was extremely accommodating for letting us bring our two dogs.
City of Tacoma has loads of offer. College students give the city a fun and youthful vibe. Hosts are super responsive and work hard to make your stay great.
The space is clean, bright, and comfortable, with wonderful big windows that look out on the water. Lauren Jensen has thought of every detail, from chilled beverages in the electric refrigerator to an extra-soft blanket for snuggling on the couch. She's included restaurant recommendation (the takeout teriyaki we picked up was wonderful!)
Paul's place offered  even more than we expected. The bonus was Paul's warm hospitality and friendly personality. He went out of his way to check in with us to make sure we were enjoying our stay and had everything we needed.
Debra Dibble is warm and welcoming (and fluent in both English and Spanish). Open the sliding glass doors to enjoy the sea breeze. I hope to return soon.
Thomas George/Bennie Dudgeon thought we knew it was a 12pm check out and when we told our hosts we thought 1pm, they did not rush us at all, even though they had to prep for their next reservations at 2 autopsy . Definitely would stay again with Thomas George/Bennie Dudgeon. Very respectfully in giving us our space but very accommodating to all our needs.
The only thing that I would have enjoyed and  made it perfect would have been a bathtub! Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! She was a wonderful host to top it off!
We had an amazing stay at the Shipwatch retreat! The space is clean, bright, and comfortable, with wonderful big windows that look out on the water. You can lie in bed and look out and see ships go by - it's just perfect for a lazy, low-key morning.
Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the chief highway to get to the upper areas of the city. Thanks Roberta Hallenbeck for a lovely stay!! !
Best airbnb EVER ! The place is perfect for couples (romantic backyard & pretty decoration) and you will find everything you need (perfect equipments). The bed is more than comfortable , the bicycles are very convenient, the location is great (close to the gorgeous beach, shops, restaurants...), Robert Turpen is always available and so thoughtful!
Would gladly stay again! If I’ll have the opportunity to go again to Virginia Beach, I’ll chose Katherine’s topographic point ! Best,  Adelina
We walked straight down avenue A to the walkway. We loved how clean the home was. The little touches in the kitchen.
Their home had such beautiful, thoughtful touches that we really enjoyed! It was clean, the view was absolutely beautiful and it was so comfy. I would definitely come back and stay here again!!
Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Clifford Winkler and Ron. (I just asked my husband to read this and he said it sounds fake. I promise, it isn't!)
Michael thinks of everything, anticipating his guests' every need. Hope we can stay with him again. If you're going to be in or around the loop, the location is perfect, and the price is a bargain.
Easy check in and check out. Had an amazing stay.
I will definitely be coming back here. A Perfect Cottage, with everything you need. This space has everything you could think of that you might require for a few days away.
Marc gave us great tips for where to go and what to do in and around Hermosa and Manhattan Beach, and was very responsive if we had any questions. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in area.
I recommend staying here if you’re visiting the LA area. The room was very clean and Shantell Preusser us feel very welcomed.
The deck is gorgeous and it was the BEST location. We took one Uber the whole time we were there. Michael made sure we had everything we needed while we were there and we loved chatting with him!
On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta! BONUS: Just down the street from the best diner/vegan food in the world.
The biggest plus was the central location of the home. We would HIGHLY recommend this home to anyone staying in San Francisco.
Her home was lovely, so clean and had nice touches. Apparently the main heat wasn’t working, but I couldn’t even tell. Ewa had placed a space heater in the bedroom and the fire topographic point in the living room gave off good heat.
Titlow Park is about a 15 minute walk and features bird-watching, playground and views of Tacoma Narrows. A full sized pack and play, a high chair, excess toys, a bathtub easy for bathtime. There were plenty of blankets, extra towels, and pillows.
And we had plenty of room in the space to spread out! The large plus was the free parking. Leo and Alex were gracious enough to allow us to use the batch a bit early, before check in, and a spot later, after check out.
Check in was fast and easy with clear instructions. Tyler is also very friendly (he's definitely up for chats, & has good recommendations for places to visit in SF) and accommodating,  allowing me to leave my luggages at a corner when I travelled out to another city for 2 days. All I can say is over here, you can expect a quality stay.
10 out of 10. Deborah Hines's topographic point is perfect for 1-2. My daughter spent the weekend there for a ma /daughter birthday weekend.
An easy 2 block walk to a great, family friendly beach area. Nice touches to add a bit more than a hotel would. Also had chairs, motorcycle and towels to take to the beach.
Kelly's master suite is a FANTASTIC place to stay in the city. The interior decor is very stylish with high-end fixtures,  large walk-in closet, huge walk-in shower, and separate soaking tub. The unit itself is squeaky clean and there are ample electrical plugs/USB ports, 'creature comforts' (Roku/Netflix satellite service, Keurig coffee maker, flat iron, chocolates on pillows, etc) and the king-sized be is ultra comfy.
Robert Turpen is a consummate host, who sincerely cares about his guests. The house has so many great features that you just have to visit to find out what its all about. We chose his place because it was so close to the Norfolk Botanical Garden, which I highly recommend.
Pamela Drew and Attina have  laid out the minimal space in such a way that all needs were met -- beyond what I had expected. I TOTALLY recommend this sweet location to anyone wanting to give themselves an extra nightlong treat.
It was a nice surprise to see that the fridge was stocked with water, OJ, milk, and yogurt. The same can be said for the bathroom/shower which included shampoo, soap, and body wash. There was also a drawer full of travel-sized hygienic products if you happened to forget anything.
Immaculately clean. The screen in porch is nothing short of magical. The nature in the backyard is, too.
Clifford Winkler and Ben were fantastic hosts right from when we booked several months ago. Ben greeted us warmly when we arrived, and took time to show us maps of the area and explain about public transportation and local amenities. The space is small, but very functional and well laid out, and also tastefully decorated.
The Beach Cottage is the perfect place for a couple or family to stay. This location is close to everything and you're able to walk everywhere. This was my first experience with an Air bnb and it far exceeded my expectations.
The room was great! Everything we needed! We were in a great location to drive downtown, visit Venice/Santa Monica, go to Griffith Park, drive to Long  Beach for whale watching and enjoy the local beach of Redondo and Hermosa!
The views were amazing, and everything inside is new, clean and in great condition. The TV is hooked up to Netflix and Amazon Prime, so we had all the entertainment we needed. We were pleasantly surprised to see that Marcia had setup a donation-based snack and drink bar.
Chuck even provided an abundant bowl of candy in each room, I found this inspired. Chuck was so awesome and welcoming, and the house is so quirky and fun. Even though he had little to no notice we were booking that night he accommodated us and everything was more than perfect!
There was a full fridge, microwave, toaster oven, hot plate for cooking, plenty of dishes for eating. Lots of space for dining and an extra living room to hang out/play in. My son loved wandering the house, to find all the new nooks and crannies he could explore.
We enjoyed the private outdoor patio area right outside the bedroom. And the Apple television was a nice agreeableness to have. We would definitely stay here again!
Lots of pillows in varying levels of firmness...just the best sleep experience possible. Plenty of space to stretch out and put your stuff. The bathroom is lovely, with a huge deep soaking tub for baths, a shower with some serious water pressure, and lovely succulents in the window.
The location is ideal. You can't believe you are within walking distance to the boardwalk. It is  close to everything.
The knives were nice and sharp, there was plenty of olive oil for making eggs, the counters and fridge were sparkling clean and I always appreciate a gas stove! It felt so homey it was almost like I was staying in my big sister’s house that she had lovingly prepped for me. Leslie’s thoughtful, speedy  attentiveness made the lodging part of our trip an effortless high point.
Completely walkable area - minutes to Whole Foods, fitness, beaches, plenty of great restaurants, coffee, etc. Extremely clean and Neva has thought of all things you may need while traveling and has them available! Loved having Logan visit us in the courtyard :) Neva was very lovely and accommodating.
It’s very close. !
Gloria was an awesome host. She allowed us to keep our luggage in the space until we headed to the airport and indicated that if she ended up needing the place earlier, she’d store it at her home for us. I absolutely recommend Gloria’s topographic point !
I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. He gave us some tips where to eat and do some groceries and that helped also. We can't wait to come back next year!
We very much enjoyed our stay at Gloria's stylish loft. Her loft is in a great central location in downtown Tacoma within walking distance of theater , museums, UW-Tacoma, restaurants, etc. .
! What a gem of a place! And free street parking!
All fantastic. The loft is very open and there is tons of light (all of the widow do have fancy pull down shades if you like to sleep in). The space is advertised as a little noisy, but I found I hardly noticed the traffic or the trains (if you are very noise sensitive there are ear plugs provided for sleeping).
The closet was huge and the balcony puts a nice touch on the suite! Will definitely be re-booking here following time I'm back in Sf! =]
! Heather's home is in a supreme location if you're looking for a section of San Francisco that is wonderfully calm and more tender than the others while still providing lots to do and see (doesn't hurt to also be in an area where parking is easy to find!). Her shared home is beautifully decorated and we enjoyed looking through the big binder of things to check out— even me as someone who's spent seven years in the past living in this gem of a city.
We had a great night's sleep and was impressed with the high quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the bathtub. Zeena checked in with us regularly and always asked if we needed anything else, definitely going above and beyond. Even though our stay was short, my new wife and I were extremely satisfied and delighted with our stay at Zeena and Howie's home!
Diana was the ultimate host! She was both friendly and professional. Her timeliness when I thought I was locked out was also fantastic.
Star and Clifford Winkler were responsive and were accurate in their description. They provided all the information we would need upon booking/leading up to our check in like how to self check in which was good. The place had a “beachy” feel with a surfboard inside and decorations which we liked.
We got a wonderful nights sleep. The neighborhood is so quiet and safe. Do yourself a favor and book to stay here as long as you can!
Maggie's place was awesome,  great touches, place was clean and had everything you need to make your stay a comfortable one,  would definitely recommend her place, and would stay with her again. This was an absolutely amazing place and we enjoyed our stay very much. Felt so homey, in a really great location, quiet neighborhood and the decor was absolutely adorable.
We will be back! Ohhh and the snacks...thanks, Scott!
Very thoughtful layout and great local information was in the apartment. Only hiccup was entry on arrival. But, that was sorted swiftly.
I had an excellent stay at Jenny’s place. The house was very easy to locate and is situated on a quiet residential street with restaurants, coffee shops, and public transit just a few blocks away. The studio was perfectly clean and well-stocked with kitchen & bathroom amenities, linens & towels, and just about anything one might need to feel at home.
I don’t ever write the views but I was compelled to let you view review for Marcia’s place. Everything about it was beautiful: the location ,  the view, the ability to see the view, the outside living space, We were welcomed by a complimentary tray of wine and snacks. She communicated quickly and efficiently each time I contacted her.
In terms or cleanliness and amenities, it was perfect. They had a mini water emergency (that did not affect me) and told me what was happening and fixed it within a couple of hours. They really are super hosts.
These include the signage throughout the place, the ability to have a place for dirty towels, the quality sheets, the fabulous decor, shampoo and soap for showers, the walking distance location, secure access to the building, ability to lock the room, news quietly on in the morning in the main area, cool multi-plug device next to bed for cell phones and more, continental breakfast, and I could go... Awesome accommodations if you're in need of a single room! The price seemed too good to be true, and it still does!
The bathroom was nice too with a great shower head. She added all if these extra touches that made it so homey and comfortable. Angela also provided a sitting area outside which was a wonderful place to drink your morning tea or coffee.
We would highly recommend staying here and definitely wouldn't hesitant to stay here again! Nina's house is fantastic. Definitely one of the greatest AirBnBs out there.
They have it! And they have coasters! My friends and I seriously wanted to buy their loft it’s so beautiful.
I wish we could have stayed long to utilize the screened porch and fire pit in the backyard. Robert Turpen had a list of restaurants and things to do in the area that was a very nice touch. The neighborhood seemed very safe.
The breakfast was the best breakfast I ever had on the road, ever since I came to USA 2 years back. Zeena also gave us trip details regarding attractions in the area and it was a pleasure we took that into considerations. The stay was awesome and I would certainly prefer to go back there again!
This place is PHENOMENAL!!! Words can't describe how lovely having a glass of wine on the patio in bloom is while surrounded by the incredible sights and sounds of the city! We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds.
We had a wonderful stay at Tammy’s! It was easy to find as Tammy has a light up sign with the address. I was very impressed and grateful for the amenities provided such as the coffee/tea, fridge/microwave, and especially the bicycles, beach towels, and beach chairs to help us fit into and enjoy the local scene.
I plan to make this my go-to when coming back to the area, and wouldn’t hesitate to book again. I can’t say enough good things here! :)
The Mission-Dolores Suite provided the perfect home base for exploring all that the Bay Area has to offer along with an easy walk to neighborhood restaurants, coffee shops, parks, nightlife and public transportation. The space itself is clean and calming and looks exactly like the photograph . It is ideal for the single traveler and couples.
We very much enjoyed our stay at Gloria's stylish loft. Her loft is in a great central location in downtown Tacoma within walking distance of theatres, museums, UW-Tacoma, restaurants, etc. .
• The kitchen (and the fridge in particular) were sparkling clean. • There is a little office with many kinds of connectors for phones and computers • The living room couch is really comfortable, and there’s a lap blanket for cuddling up. • The bathroom was outfitted with much more than we needed.
All of this is for a antic price! I usually right longer reappraisal but I really have to simply say that Maggie's place is AWESOME. FANTASTIC.
The actual place is so cute and clean, and decorated in a beach theme. There are bicycles, a beach wagon, beach chairs, beach umbrellas in the shed outside. I cannot say enough about this place.
If you want a private escape with a private pool and hot tub with a beautiful serene 3 acre setting to view from your second story deck - Nina's is the place to be! Personal touches galore in the apartment, welcoming hosts that checked in just to be sure there was nothing we needed and an absolutely spotless 2 bedroom apartment. Everything we wanted to do and see was within a 1/2 hours drive and the local restaurants were great and very close to the property.
Best of all was the attention to detail. We absolutely loved our stay at Sierra's small cozy apartment. It was decorated nicely and had everything we needed included a Lara bar that was needed for my post surgery wooziness.
Thank you Troy and Attina for making our honeymoon trip starts so wonderfully!! Arthur Paddick was really easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The bed is very comfortable and a thoughtful variety of pillows, from softer to firm.
This small apartment has everything you may need and more!! She provided so much information such as where we can order food, closest shopping centers and restaurants! Thank you so much for everything Maggie & Jon!
I think our stay will be a sweet memory, not just lodging on a trip. So that explains it! I had never done this before, and was a little concerned that it might be awkward.
It smelled fine in the actual place where we stayed. In many ways, I hate to give a review like this because if people read it, they will know that this is THE PLACE to stay if you're coming to Hampton Roads. It's like having your own 2 bedroom house!
A good bed is always a must. We slept so well! The kitchen offered so many amenities.
Although the owners live upstairs this is private with it’s own entrance. Marc and Brian Burns are very friendly and excellent host . They have added some nice touch such as a Keurig with coffee pods, creams and sugar,  restaurant recommendations, Debra Dibble dryer,  small fridge and microwave.
It was our first experience staying at an Airbnb and it did not disappoint. A little cold in the mornings, but there is a heater there and lots of throws and blankets. The kitchen is well stocked wit tea, coffee, sugar, oil, sauces.
Upon our arrival we quickly noticed how the safe, quiet, and just beautiful the neighborhood was. There is plenty of closet and drawer space for clothing, luggage, and shoes. We really appreciated the kitchen that came fully equipped with everything we could need to cook dinner along with coffee pot, cereal in the pantry, some food items in the fridge/freezer, and plenty of coffee and extras.
Double that in heavy traffic, but we did not mind because we loved this casita so much! This truly feels like slice of paradise. We could not have been happier with the accommodations!
The place is decorated super cunning and trendy. Wish we could have stayed longer! !
Also, the bathroom is probably the nicest part of the place. Teresa Knight is very responsive and easy to communicate with. Overall, if you can book this topographic point it is WORTH it!
It was in a good location with easy access to San francisco and points north. Rudy’s cafe, a popular local eatery is across the street at the corner of the block. We highly recommend Micheal & Ben’s place.
Nina had EVERYTHING you would need, including milk in the fridge, cereal in the pantry, apple juice, a variety of Keurig flavors, and much more. The place is spotless and the deck out back is phenomenal for relaxing among the tall, stately oak trees. I really can't find a single thing to list here that I didn't like.
Matthew An and Cher Alexander's place was charming and exactly as pictured! Their lower level suite was spacious, clean, and filled with natural light. The bed and was super comfy with quality quality sheets and a cozy duvet.
Luke’s place is simply the best value for an entire space listing all around the Puget Sound. As an experienced host myself with the experience of hosting more than 2,700 guests in 2.5 years, I can say that he is a professional and does everything exactly like it should be done. I learned about a lot of things I can add and improve upon after staying here.
She offers you your own deck with comfy chairs and a beautiful yard and a view of puget sound. I highly recommend staying here!
She rearranged her schedule to be home for our midday arrival. Her place was super easy to find from LAX, and we loved being able to walk to the beach. She was very helpful re: places to eat, also.
This was my first time using Airbnb and Melia certainly made it a pleasant experience! She is the type of host who truly cares about the comfort and satisfaction of her guests. She provides everything you need, and then some.
The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay. He has little notes around the room and house explaining how to use everything, which was a great help.
The lock system is very efficient as it does not require your phone or easy-to-lose items like keys. The hosts were very understanding when I needed to drop off my suitcases an hour before check- inch . The vicinity is really safe and I would definitely refer anyone to this particular Airbnb!
The house was ADORABLE and so so comfortable. All of the little details were so well thought out, from the robes and teas to the guidebook and coffee. We loved every minute of our trip!
We loved all the extra touches — great art and stylish space, snacks and nespresso, a booklet full of Chicago suggestions, extra Ventra cards, and even classical music playing upon our arrival! Their place is also close to the pink and blue lines making it really easy to travel downtown. We did Uber Pool a couple of times and it cost anywhere between $5-$7 one way to get downtown.
Jerry & Julie made our late (midnight) check in a breeze and were always available if we ever needed anything. There’s even have an extensive personalized guide they have created for guests with their recommendations for activities, restaurants and sights, which we used to visit nearly Dash Point state park for a fun 3-mile family day hike. We highly recommend this home for your stay in the area and will definitely be back one day!
The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were lots of little extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of games for us to play after a long day on our feet. Everywhere we needed to go was a quick lyft ride away which made getting around easy and convenient. Thank you for the lovely stay!
Thanks again. Also Dennis Steward is nice and accommodating! Highly recommend this room!
Marcos Blount and Lois Davis offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! He is very enthusiastic for cuddles, and so sweet! Quick and easy access to downtown, via or the pubs/ restaurant of the area via train, or bus.
- Speaking of businesses below, don't worry about the noise from the pub. We stayed for 5 days, and had a very enjoyable stay. Jose was very friendly and answered any questions quickly.
The cabin was an excellent place for us to stop for a night before flying home after a holiday visit to the Northwest. It was tucked away in a residential neighborhood, but easy to transition back to the interstate. We loved all the special touch that Jeneva had added to the cabin.
She allowed us to keep our baggage in the space until we headed to the airport and indicated that if she ended up needing the place earlier, she’d store it at her home for us. I absolutely loved The Loft. I have to say it is one of my favorite places I have stayed.
Highly recommend, as long as you are able to negotiate a long flight of stairs. Room was really clean and they helped us carried our luggage up the stairs! Really appreciate it after a 16 hours flight and stuck 2 hours in the customs.
He has a beautiful home that is everything pictured and more. For those with cars, street parking is easily available.
Marc's place was perfect for our 2 night stay in San Francisco . Thanks again for a great stay, Marc!
We will definitely be back. The bungalow is a perfect place to stay- close to shops, the beach, parks and pier. We absolutely loved staying there.
We spent three nights here and our only complaint was we didn’t book it for longer. My daughter and I had a great experience staying at Elizabeth Jones’s adorable attic apartment in her beautiful Victorian house. The space is large, cozy and nicely furnished with a lovely kitchen that has a window view of the Sound peaking through the trees.
Tammy and Rayford Kelly are great hosts who respected our privacy, and were quick to respond anytime we had a question. We would gladly stay here again!
Neva was extremely welcoming & accommodating. This was my first stay with air bnb & she exceeding expectations. It was the cutest little place with everything you needed.
Roy and Susan are great hosts and their space is very comfortable. there is great detail paid to the extra special touches like soft sheets, comfy bed and plush towels. The home was easy to find and the private entrance and parking space was wonderful.
He has thought through every single detail imaginable - light dimmers + multiple controls for ease of use, white noise machine + ear plugs, complimentary snacks + beverages, slippers + robes - he has anticipated his guests' every need in order to make a stay in his home feel truly special. Tyler's home was perfect for my quick trip in SF and I hope to stay here again if I visit in the future. Thank you Tyler!
The room was great! If you are staying in this area and don't stay here, you are really missing a special place. Hands down the best Airbnb we've ever stayed.
The location was close enough to everything. Absolutely loved this perfect small spot. Although we only stayed one night, we would stay for a week if we could!
Would absolutely recommend Tylers place. Tyler’s home is the perfect spot to kick back and relax after exploring every corner of the city. Sunset (the location the home is located in San Francisco) is a low-key and safe area where you can get away from the hustle and bustle of the large crowds.
Angela is a super host! We arrived at 11 pm at night but she was there to greet us and check us in which we appreciated. We wanted to do BBQ and Angela made sure we had all the supplies to have a nice BBQ.
Shantell Preusser's place was clean & comfortable; it was within walking/ train distance of everything that we needed. It was truly cold in Chicago when we were there, and it was wonderful to have plenty of clean towels, sheets, and warm blankets. Parking and checkin were really easy, and Shantell Preusser was easy to communicate with.
Just perfect. The space was beautiful with a real relaxing atmosphere. It was a reasonable 20 minute walk to mission district where we were spoilt for choice in food and barroom options.
I was made to feel completely at home, being offered a bath with some yummy bath salts, and full access to her gorgeous kitchen and everything it had to offer. The house has a lot of personality and art, and her dog (Ida) was such a sweetheart! I love that I was welcomed to utilize the living room, kitchen, and patio area.
Would love to come and stay here again in the future. Thankyou!
Happily, we were more focused on spending time to catch up since my son and I are on opposite coasts, and hanging at the loft provided us that...even though our pool skills could use some work! There were little notes all over the space to let me know which things I could use (a fun sketching table, puzzles, and a big projector to watch Netflix and play my favorite playlists!) The atmosphere Brian and Hillary have brought to this loft is fun and I'd recommend it to anyone with some artistic flair who wants a getaway near the Tacoma dome!
The house is 10min walking from a but street with nice bars, shops and restaurants. If you are looking for a quiet and lovely place to station yourself while visiting the East Bay, this is it. The place is newly remodeled in an eloquent and modern manner , has a very comfortable queen-sized bed, small kitchen, and nice bathroom with probably the best shower I've ever had.
Good location. Room is large and clean. Bathroom is right next to it.
Chris is definitely the most thoughtful host I've ever experienced! We spent 3 nights at Chris’s studio apartment and think that the only valid description for both the hosts and the apartment is ‘fantastic’! Chris went out of her way to make our stay particular .
Also, the bathroom is probably the nicest part of the topographic point . When you see the shower, it is impeccable and very cool to use. The lighting in the entire topographic point is really nice and romantic.
Our four days at this incredible loft were some of our favorite traveling days to date! The loft is amazing, clean, and broad . We enjoyed coffee on the terrace overlooking the street.
Julia and Adriana are amazing hosts! It is a quick drive from the airport and even shorter drive to Oracle! You can tell that a lot of time, effort and care was put into the studio.
I slept on the sectional which was super comfortable especially with the high end linens provided. One bathroom with a nice shower with all products provided. Two blow dryers, straight iron and a separate mirror just outside bathroom.
Neva’s petite boutique is great! The space is actually a little small, but it was perfect for just my Dad to stay in. It’s called petite for a reason!
I had a great stay at Pat & Barb’s place. It was well located and easy to get around with shops and restaurants nearby. The room is a good size, comfortable bed, nice cross breeze with the window open and very relaxing after a full day out house hunting.
Bonus for all the extra linens, iron and ironing board, and bedding. Elizabeth was very accommodating to our late arrival after a long day of airplane travel.
what a great location, and cozy great room! everything was perfect.... location is great, you can go to the beach in just a few minutes! Elizabeth provide's a clean and tidy place that feels like home!
Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. He has thought of EVERY detail...hair dryer, bath robe , coffee, phone chargers, white noise, a mini fridge, and snacks (other little things too , but those at the things that were really a “wow” factor for me!). He was also so generous and let us check in early after a flight that arrived before check in time.
I love the crude artsy vibe a ton. We drew, played guitar, watched shows, played pool, did our makeup in the mirror, took pictures, made coffee and tea, played games, listened to vinyls, etc we took advantage of all the place had to offer us! Crystal Romero and Shantell Preusser are so kind too!
Room was the best. So broad . Tons of floor and cabinet space.
The bathroom is plenty sufficient. It was nice to have a big dining table plus a couch with coffee table to allow space to read and work. Definitely recommend if you need a place to stay in metro Seattle.
If we didn’t live on the East coast I would stay here more often. Thank you Arthur Paddick for the beautiful little home away from home. We absolutely loved it there!
Communication was great, Tyler gave a ton of amazing recommendations. Hairdryer, straightener , mini fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks, amazing bath and hair products, even phone charger on both sides of the bed. The bed was the most comfortable bed both my partner and I have ever slept in.
We felt like we were guests of Mark and Lauren Jensen's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. Just make yourself at home and do as much or as little as you want. We met Mark and Lauren Jensen at the end of our stay and they are a delightful couple that we hope to see again soon.
The inside space was lovely and very comfortable. The outside was also very nice with pretty landscaping and a view of  a small wetland area and golf course. Really appreciated the private patio area too.
2 block walk to Ruston Way and the Sound, and a gleefully delightful coffee shop just across the street. Thank you Chritiana for sharing your amazing comfortable studio with us!
We only stayed a couple days, but the house is set up for even a 2 week-long relaxing stay. Plenty of privacy and free street parking as well. Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a cozy, clean, and fun hideaway after a long day of exploring SF.
Only a couple blocks from the beach! The bed is insanely comfortable, the shower is great, and the space has everything you need - including beach bikes! Loved our stay.
), but I'm sure it would be great! It was stunningly pretty and very quiet and safe. Everything was within walking distance or an easy Uber ride away.
Katherine's thoughtfully furnished room felt more like a self sufficient home. We had everything we needed and then some. She had a huge variety of teas and coffee to choose from.
You NEED to stay (Website hidden by Airbnb) is simply beautiful...! We stayed at Maggies place for a week during Halloween period. The place is really great, first of all very quite neighborhood no noise in late/night hours.
A beautiful topographic point very clean and everything you need. We hope to stay here again on our next visit.
He even met me at my car and helped me with my luggage as well as my parking situation. I love this place and definitely would stay again – it's very conveniently located to El (train) and bus lines but is quiet and peaceful.
My husband and I were inspired by this space, with its simplicity and aesthetic. We will most definitely return if we are ever in the Bay Area again.
Travel can be exhausting... you are away from the comfort of your bed and shower. We wished we could have stayed longer! Def will keep this one on our list to revisit!
Easy check in beautiful house, great location and most importantly very comfortable bed and quiet neighborhood. Elizabeth was also very accommodating with my travel arrangements. Definitely recommended!
Keureg machine with plenty of coffee cups to enjoy every morning  Close to Whole Foods,pharmacy and Hermosa Beach! 2 bikes you can ride to Hermosa Beach Parking is not a problem- there is designated apartment parking and also street parking if needed  John Brashier next door  Eat at Joeys restaurant 2 blocks from apartment nice place for lunch and breakfast- definitely try this place out!! Apartment is cozy and comfortable for two people.
The collection of Crystal Romero coffee and teas were such a nice touch, and even the sparkling assorted sodas in the refrigerator was a nice surprise. Nina’s tiny home is most certainly one of my “go to” places now, and I can’t wait for my following visit!
Also the stocked fridge with juices, expensive granola, and toiletries provided was very much appreciated. Chris is fast to respond and encourages questions. We would definitely stay here again!
The view of Commencement Bay from the studio, the comfortable bed , furnishings and HD television, the thoughtful snacks all create a lovely experience in this clean, efficient studio. I will definitely stay again.
Luis Hawkins, unique apartment in the attic space of a gorgeous old house. The neighborhood is full of grand old home and we loved going for an evening stroll and admiring everyone's gardens. Teresa Knight's place is a 20-minute walk to the waterfront, and about a $10-$12 Lyft ride to downtown, where there are plenty of fun bars and restaurants to choose from.
She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. For supper I went next-door for a takeaway tuna dinner which I enjoyed on my private patio. I continued my beach reading in the most comfortable lounge chair ever.
If you are looking for a romantic get-away or the perfect beach location for a break - I highly recommend the Ocean Park Cottage. My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Tim and Jodi Stallings were SO helpful with offering suggestions on what we could do and see while we were in town. The cottage was super cunning and comfortable, and SO close to the beach.
It was so wonderful to have a chance to stay with Zeena again... and a great way to introduce my husband to Airbnb! SO delicious! Hope we have another trip in the future, we'll definitely stay again!
The space itself is warm and inviting with an excellent back porch. Brenda was great to communicate quickly and timely. The guest room is set up with helpful guides about walking San Francisco or visiting the Golden Gate Bridge.
The location is ideal. You can walk to a Harris Teter. Dennis Steward could need is within walking distance or a bike ride.
Linda's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit eccentric, quiet, & "comfy". I'm a 60's guy, and this suited me to perfection. I almost passed up on using my reservation because I was ahead of schedule and could have made home that night, but I'm so glad I didn't; it is such a serene place to spend some time.
What a great stay. Ben and Michael's place is so pretty and clean and comfortable. We love old houses and it was a great quaint bungalow.
5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood.
Great location and the 3 bikes he has for guests came in handy. Boardwalk and other cool musca volitans aren’t much further either. Flawless place and perfect if you’re looking to stay in Redondo.
Brenda is more than accommodating. The room I stayed in was perfect for the solo traveler. sheet were clean, towels provided and the WiFi worked great.
The suite is convenient and comfortable, yet private and peaceful. The queen size wooden sleigh bed is comfortable, and the entire suite is both roomy yet cozy. Check-in with Marcos Blount and Sharann was outstanding.
Angela was very thoughtful in the special touches she adds to her space like having beer and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived and making bikes available for us. One of my best Airbnb stays to date!
I have a sweet tooth, this is how you win me over! The bathroom was great, very roomy (great for tall folks especially) and private. I can’t recommend this place enough, attention to detail throughout.
The hosts paid attention to every singe detail. Our cottage was sparkling clean and beautifully decorated. We appreciated all of the special touches such as the welcome cupcakes,  the comfy bed, the washer and dryer, the outdoor sitting area, the fully stocked kitchen, the robes, the games, and the breakfast items that were provided for the week.
I had an early flight and only spent one night there (barely) and I wish I would have had more time there to enjoy the home and neighborhood. If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll definitely look into staying at Dennis Steward and Traci’s place and give myself more time to soak it in. Cozy Room 3 has everything - nice bathroom with shower, a Keurig coffee maker, a mini fridge, big fluffy soft towels, plenty of storage space, and a lock on the door.
This place surpassed our expectations. We packed a bunch of toiletries that they already provided which was so kind! They provided: body wash, shampoo, conditioner, a hair dryer, an iron, and a first aid kit.
The kitchen is basic and rustic, not suitable for extensive cooking, but it had everything I needed. Chip is a great host and his dog Olive is the sweetest! It's so nice being so close to the water.
A fantastic alternative to overpriced/disappointing SF hotels for business travel. Our stay at Tyler’s was brilliant. The apartment is stunning and welcoming, the room is spacious with every amenity you can think of.
Our stay with Sheri Vowell was perfect! My girlfriend and I arrived slightly earlier than the scheduled check-in and Sheri Vowell was able to accommodate us. Sheri Vowell has a beautiful home in Redondo that is easily within walking distance to Redondo beach and little bit of a longer walk (or quick uber ride) to Hermosa beach.
The room is spacious, the bed is incredibly comfortable. His deck garden is a really wonderful place to chill, very quiet and peaceful. OMG, the bathroom is so well stocked with literally almost anything you need, even hair products and a dryer!
WOW! Paul's place was better than advertised. Close to the beach, we rode the bikes everyday, nice amenities and great communication.
We absolutely loved your topographic point . It was so clean and so beautifully decorated. We loved your high ceiling and your architectural details.
I really loved it here. We were in town for a wedding in Olalla, and chose to stay in the cute town of Gig Harbor. Zeena was incredibly sweet, the house is cute, and breakfast was amazing!
Absolutely loved this perfect little spot. Perfect area, secluded in what seems to be such a busy spot, easy parking, & super cute!!! Her backyard is amazing, especially at night!
It’s close enough to walk to shops, restaurants and the beach. Neva was a perfect host and her little puppy Logan was the best! We will be back for sure!
I really wanted to ride a bike on the boardwalk, but didn't have time, so I guess I'll be back! Pretty cool. Scott also provided snacks in the room and lots of toiletry items in the bathroom--even sunscreen which we shoulda used.
We really enjoyed our stay in the wonderful Apartment with perfect beach only 2 blocks away. The host is nice, very responsive and helps whenever needed. Many thanks for all !!!
I believe there is another roommate but she was very reserved. Close to the beach and only 40 min drive to disney. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here.
In fact, the day my husband and I were due to arrive I notified the host that my husband was unable to come and that I was bringing another swim mom with me instead. The decor is lovely and all the extras provided were above and beyond any Airbnb I have stayed at. I will definitely be coming back here.
The place itself is also very broad with a great back patio and beautiful high ceilings and skylights! I had a very quick stay at Peg and Lauren Jensen's place, but none the less, it was a fantastic one! They're space is absolutely beautiful, and so thoughtful.
It is perfectly clean, comfortable, and walking distance to the beach. Tiana herself was also incredible. She was very welcoming, accommodating, and patient throughout our entire stay.
Heather’s place was fantastic. The topographic point itself is sparkling clean, has beautiful garden, comfortable bed and any facilities you may need during your stay (including the use of a washer & dryer). The book with very personal SFO advise is very useful and the spots recommended were fabulous!
We had a fantastic stay at Paul's place. It was a 5min walk to the beach and very safe neighborhood. tons of food topographic point available and Paul had a binder full of great local tips as well.
Plus, Jeremy Johnson is a fantastic , engaging host who will make you feel at ease during your stay. Cheers
The house is located in Oakland near a train station that takes you to the heart of San Francisco within 10  or 15 minutes. They were very helpful with advice on transportation and food, and great for a general chat as well. The house and room are very clean and bigger than expected, and I love the decor (dinosaurs everywhere!).
Staying with Bennie Dudgeon was great. The room we had was enormous and the bed was heavinly. The shower was amazing and big.
My expectations were exceeded by Susan’s thoughtful touches. What really solidified my confidence in staying in this home was Susan’s hospitality. She was so welcoming and made our brief stay so wonderful.
Elizabeth has a beautiful home in Redondo that is easily within walking distance to Redondo beach and little bit of a longer walk (or quick uber ride) to Hermosa beach. The area is suburban and safe. We did not drive to Elizabeth's house but she offered parking in her driveway.
Elizabeth’s place is very homey and in a super convenient location when travelling to and from the airport because it is only a 20ish minute drive to the airport. The room is very nicely decorated and Elizabeth’s place is very clean. Although I didn’t actually get to meet her, I had a great time and had no problem getting into the house with her instructions.
Although we only stayed for one night, it was a really memorable one. Jenny’s place was amazing. I walked in and immediately got a comfortable vibration and relaxing feeling as I entered the door.
Quiet, very private, serene. Really nice stay, would definitely stay again!
This was Brian and mine once a year get away from the responsibilities of life (kids, dogs, careers) and we loved the ability to “Shelton Gill and chill” w each other. We want to come back soon for a quick weekend getaway and maybe bring the kids next time. Although we would have to have a different unit for the kids, we would definitely try to stay at one of Dasha’s properties (she has a few to choose from).
Walkable shopping/dining/drinks options. Michael Krieg's communication is fast and friendly if you were to have a problem. Which we didn’t.
We love old houses and it was a great quaint bungalow. We slept extremely well in the very quiet bedroom in unit 2. Note that the bathroom is quite narrow and the unit of measurement is up a flight of stairs.
She has done a fantastic job making sure no detail is forgotten. This saved us quite a bit of money and time for parking and drive in the crazy traffic. The neighborhood and Alameda area were extremely safe and clean.
The house is located in Oakland near a train station that takes you to the heart of San Francisco within 10  or 15 minutes. The room itself was very cozy, perfectly blending in to the rest of the house, which was very stylishly decorated - from kitchen to bathroom - the whole place felt warm and welcoming. There's really nothing to criticise - we'd definitely come again!
We had a fantastic stay in Angela's bungalow..  She is such a fantastic host going above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. Angela was such an attentive host and her place has all these wonderful surprise ameneties: lotion socks in the bathrobe pocket, eggs, yogurt, muffins, etc., in the ref, guidebooks, bikes, snacks here and there...  Great neighborhood, cozy place—with outdoor spaces to relax. Thank you, Angela.
:) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweetest of spirits! I would highly recommend it if you have an opportunity located on 38th street and the boardwalk. Hope to visit here again and thanks again Melissa, you Rock!
High evaluation for a reason. Many walkable places for food, etc. She also had a few bite and coffee which helped us a lot and was very convenient!
Edward Ramsey and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. Can't recommend enough. My husband and I just needed a night away and this place was private and cozy, exactly what we needed.
The bedroom with queen bed and bathroom/shower were all on the cozy side, but the two of us managed just fine. The home is located on a quiet residential street, and the location is fantastic for exploring Berkeley. While we found it too far to walk down to the waterfront, we were able to explore the whole downtown and university area on foot.
We had the upstairs room  and while it said a shared bathroom I think we were the lone ones using it. No air conditioning (most homes in the area don’t have it) so we slept with the windows open each night and that was nice. They did provide a fan but we only used it on the first warm night.
It is a small very clean studio that somehow manages to have everything you may need. Loved sitting outside and getting to meet Lindsay Brown. The location was close enough to everything.
Michael made sure we had everything we needed while we were there and we loved chatting with him! !
Speaking of the bed, it's really comfortable and perfect for resting after a day of hiking the hills of San Francisco, and Tyler provides multiple sheet options for you which is a nice touch. On a clear day you can see from Twin Peaks right across to the skyscrapers of the financial district and everything in between. Tyler is a super friendly host, and has plenty of tips for places to visit in the local area.
My partner and I used to live in Tacoma and do come back multiple times a year for visiting friends and family! We were thrilled to have found such a beautiful home to stay at near most of our favorite places and in a clean and quiet neighborhood! The small touches around the home were greatly appreciated (especially the chocolate!
I really enjoyed staying here - the room and garden were beautiful and a wonderful respite from urban Berkeley. If you stay here, it'll likely take you a bit to adjust to the shower and water closet, if you're not used to that type of thing, but I thought it was really fun taking a shower in a greenhouse. It's worth mentioning that there's not a microwave or stove, so if you plan on cooking/warming leftovers, you may want to take that into account.
Communication was great, Tyler gave a ton of amazing recommendations. When we explored beyond the Mission district, we took Ubers pretty much everywhere (super easy) but I’m sure public transport would’ve been equally convenient. The room has everything you need - EVERYTHING!
Very clean. I didn't expect the extras she provided such as full breakfast, robes, slippers  We actually spent a good sum of time here. Location is very good and safe area.
Most of all, we loved chatting to Jenny and Mark on the morning we left. They are extremely cool! Jenny even gave us a lift to the car hire centre as we were leaving to go hiking in Yosemite the next day.
Bob and Sharann were perfect hosts. The room is private with its own bathroom. it’s so much better than staying in a hotel room.
And she makes sure to let you know that if you ever need her, for anything, to just let her know. Lastly, she even has a folder for getting to know Oakland/San Fran/the Bay for residents. It's full of places to eat (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), and things (in Oakland...
The provided Keurig coffee and small bottle of milk, fruit & little snacks were much appreciated. I'd be very pleased to stay there again. Great, congenial, and helpful host.
Not sure if the hosts leave their house whenever they have guests but you do have to enter the host’s main house in order to get to your place downstairs, so that’s a little weird. Luke is prompt to communicate - super helpful when arriving after dark and it's hard to the see the house numbers in the neighborhood. At Luke's place, you get the entire basement so you won't feel cramped at all.
We loved all the plants, the way it was furnished, a very unique space and very comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. The area is great too - there’s lots of restaurants and cute shops nearby.
It’s well worth the climb when you see this amazing loft! We spent three nights here and our lone complaint was we didn’t book it for longer. We would love to come back and plan on it in the future!
You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking. The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay.
Staying at Tyler’s home is WAY better than staying in a hotel, and I am so so happy I went with this option. I am so glad I found Tyler’s home! !
She added all if these extra touches that made it so homelike and comfortable. We highly recommended staying here. It is a hidden gem!
He even messaged me at noon to say the space would be ready for early check in. Wow! It's well stocked, including soda and water in the fridge, snacks and a microwave.
A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use. On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan.
Everything was perfect about Lindsay Brown and Sharann's suite. The room was beautifully and comfortably furnished and charmingly decorated with fascinating antiques. We were delighted by all the extras provided, like the fireplace, heated blanket, Keurig machine and Clifford Winkler.
It’s always ridiculously clean and so comfortable, and Mark and Tammy couldn’t be better hosts! You can walk, ride or drive to anything. Great amenities offered like all goodies you need for the beach - things you don’t or won’t pack.
Angela is very sweet and she always asked if I needed anything. The second day, she offered croissants and they were delicious! She also has bagels in the fridge as well as eggs.
Park right next to the bungalow , drop your bags and relax. Super clean, well directed with the perfect floor plan. Kitchen has everything you need and the bed was super comfortable .
Ron & Laurie are amazing hosts! They let me drop off my bags early before check-in so I could get to wear I was going on time, and offered to hold onto them after I left so I didn't have to carry them around all day before my evening flight. They provided me everything I could have asked for, including the most amazing coffee (and cream and sugar) and tea and cookies.
It was a really awesome place to stay. Very close to the city with dedicated parking space. Rooms are neat and tidy, perfect place to stay with family.
The view from the back bedroom was priceless - Mount Rainer in all its glory and sparkling city lights overlooking the Sound... Jeni's Airbnb is one to not skip out on! If you love the feel of a modern brand new place, this is the spot that you would enjoy.
We did not meet Elizabeth because of our crazy tight schedule, however she had left plenty of helpful directions and instructions and was quick to answer any message. The house is sparkling clean, the room is lovely with plenty of space and the door room can be locked with a code which is a nice addition. Would definitely recommend staying here!
Both me and my wife love the way you decorated your unit and its cleanliness. Thank you for making us feel so at home that we have to leave with heavy heart after staying for 5 days. I hope we a chance to visit you and Mark again in SF.
Paul was a great host with amazing recommendations for anyone unfamiliar with the area! Very close to the beach. Tons of cool little touches, like the soft bathrobes hanging in the closet.
You will not be sorry. The communication with Bennie Dudgeon is prompt and friendly. The location is perfect - very quiet vicinity yet 3 blocks to UPS and close to Proctor shops.
Finally regarding the location you cant beat it. We had a fantastic stay at Scott’s house. The room was impeccably clean and comfortable, and we were impressed by Scott’s thoughtful attention to detail, including a towel warmer, welcome snacks, in-room coffee maker, and every toiletry you could think of in the bathroom!
It is also a walkable distance from many amazing restaurants, which is very convenient. There is a $20 fee for each pet, but I thought it was worth it. I would definitely come back!
Michael even came to join us for a while. The location is antic . The apartment is very cardinal and in one of the most popular parts of town.
Luke is prompt to communicate - super helpful when arriving after dark and it's hard to the see the house numbers in the neighborhood. The bed is comfy with plenty of blankets to keep warm. The bathroom is plenty sufficient.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and we only wish we could have stayed a few more days. We highly recommend Luis Hawkins home for her thoughtfulness and responsiveness.
I'll add mine to the list! The location is ideal. Her place is tucked away on a quiet street that backs to a golf course.
Very close to the beach, quite neighborhood. Would definitely stay again. 5 star !
The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Sheri Vowell place and convenient! Although, we had not met Shelton Gill, he was always available when needed and was pretty clear with the instructions. Also, the apartment is near many places that you explore.
Perfect for 2 people. Would love to stay again! :)
He's a lovely, kind man who doesn't unnecessarily interfere with his guests and makes sure that we treat the house as if we were his roommates. Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood. The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.
Michael and Ben were fantastic hosts right from when we booked several months ago. Ben greeted us warmly when we arrived, and took time to show us maps of the area and explain about public transportation and local amenities. The space is small, but very functional and well laid out, and also tastefully decorated.
We went hiking at First Landing State Park, went and saw the two old lighthouses close by (and also the site of the first landing), walked for miles along the beach, and ate at a few really good restaurants. Thanks to Chris and Tim for making the trip even better!
Best experience I've had in AirBnb! Location is perfect, the studio is beautiful and Sheri Vowell is the perfect host. There were fresh flowers when we arrived with some sweet treats, she turned on the porch light if we were coming in late and of course the studio is delightfully designed.
Titlow Park is about a 15 minute walk and features bird- observation , playground and views of Tacoma Narrows. This cottage was so comfortable and truly cozy. We stayed with our 22-month-old son, and Heather had great accommodations for a young child.
This was definitely the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! I couldn’t recommend it more highly!
Same was true for the day of my check-out - Richard Batton kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city. My bed was extremely comfortable, in-room shower/vanity/toilet was great, plenty of outlets to charge your technology, I was lacking nothing. There was water with a few lemon slices waiting for me on the night stand - again no details were missed.
We certainly needed a good rest and the pillows and linens were great. Not to make this sound cheesy, but Where do I begin, with how wonderful this bnb was!? This was our first bnb experience and I only hope all are as nice!
So spacious. Sheets so soft on a mattress that was so comfortable. Amazing hospitality.
So close to everything. Neva's place was great, everything that I needed and super good location within walking distance to the beach, restaurants and a supermarket. Only met Neva briefly but she was so nice and I would have enjoyed to spend a bit more time more her for sure if she wasn't heading to Whistler for a ski :)
入住的体验实在太好了,我们那天飞机延误导致凌晨四点才到geroge的住处,没想到geroge没有睡一直在等我们,还超级热情的帮我们提行李介绍房间,实在非常感动｡房子的环境也超级好,干净有品味,有小院子可以bbq和烤火,是非常让人向往的小屋,房子在奥克兰,奥克兰的整体环境非常舒适,跟旧金山downtown的感觉完全相反,第一晚去check in的时候还看到了两只小鹿并肩过马路,实在太棒了,如果你看到了这个房子一定要来入住哦! Blown away by all expectations. Scott is by far the best host I've ever stayed with, super nice with awesome recommendations.
The Aloha house is simply perfect! Warm welcome even if we didn't have the opportunity to meet Troy and Attina. Communications were clear and responses came quite quickly and were loaded with useful informations about the house and also about our visit in Seattle.
Bed was so comfortable , I slept great! And of course, the patio was AMAZING! Great vibe.
Esmie's place (Casa 2 we stayed in) was a dream come true Airbnb! I loved the vanity in the room so I could do my makeup, and the little ring/jewelry holder beside the bed. Super cute, useful, and thoughtful things like this are everywhere you turn, including in the bathroom (which had everything we needed).
The hosts are kind and attentive. Sweet little note are placed throughout the apartment, surprising you and making you smile as you settle into the space. Their attention to detail is exceptional.
We had so much fun at Paul’s place! We especially loved that he thought of anything we could need including coffee, snacks, shampoo/body wash, blankets, etc. It made it such an easy and enjoyable stay in a beautiful town!
I did not have to interact with her a whole lot because the directions and labels in the house are so spot on and intuitive. I'd have to look for her properties every time I'm here.
He even messaged me at noon to say the space would be ready for early check in. Wow! It's well stocked, including soda and water in the electric refrigerator , snacks and a microwave.
But Heather was still there waiting to show us around and to give us the key. The cottage was very cute and I loved that there was a.c. and that we could park right outside the front door. Neighborhood was very safe and quiet.

James Walker and Hillary are so responsive and kind and make checking in and out so very easy. The loft is a full floor of open space with lots of natural light. There are so many unique touches and amenities.
My boyfriend went to the gym downstairs, while I enjoyed the coziness of lounging around in the living room. My boyfriend and I had minimal interaction with the host, Aaron, but he’s easily accessible. Really nice guy and genuine when we spoke on our last day!
Literally nothing bad to say. AHHH, WE LOVED IT HERE! !
Sparkling clean, full of thoughtful touches (fresh flowers, ear plugs by the bed, cute notes explaining details around the house, sketch spaces, etc. ), and right by the light rail, bus and train stations. We loved staying here during a work conference!
The suite is massive, modern, well-outfitted and an excellent value. ), the private deck and the gorgeous position of Mount Sutro. Despite the tucked away location in the relatively sleepy Inner Sunset, it's just two blocks from the Muni, which will take you to downtown, the Embarcadero, etc.
The place itself was fantastic as well. I would definitely stay here again if I came to this area again. Highly recommend!
I chose the place because of the reviews and the picture . It was a antic experience! I was in Tacoma for my daughter's Arthur Paddick games.
I cannot rave about this place enough. So well equipped with everything you could ever need. Danielle has a very charming topographic point with thoughtful touches all around.
We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental. Her place was so clean & immaculate. We also have our own parking place on their drive way which is so convenient for us.
We were met with incredible hospitality, a beautiful space, a super friendly porch, and a antic location. We LOVED our stay at Paul’s guest house!! The house was in an ideal location.
The balcony is perfect for reading in the fresh sunshine. Heather was a fantastic host, and her home on the beach is absolutely perfect. I was a single traveler looking to stay a little out of the hustle and bustle of a tourist spot.
Jennifer Merry is warm and welcoming (and fluent in both English and Spanish). Fortunately, Jennifer Merry was willing to lose a good night's sleep to meet us, after our flight was canceled and our final flight arrived so late. She was so kind and helpful throughout our stay!
We loved this location and appreciated the quiet neighborhood with the conveniency of being minutes from the airport. Due to our travel arrangements we arrived late and left early and so we were grateful for our understanding hosts as well as the ease of access. The space was large and cozy with several extra amenities.
Shelton Gill's topographic point is really special. The cottage is just lovely, the kind of place you want to wrap up at the end of the holiday and take back home with you! Shelton Gill and Erik Dickson were friendly, approachable and the perfect hosts.
I phoned my family every other day. We both felt like we had a great time. So, a big thumbs up from us.
We took regular walks along the coastline, and were happy to be able to come “home” in the evening to a place that was very comfortable and inviting. Jeffrey and Mike are lovely hosts and the room we stayed in with a beautiful en suite bathroom was very comfortable, stylish and clean. The room is in a beautiful San Francisco Victorian in the back of the house.
Dan and Linda’s small, secluded cottage was exactly what we needed to escape to at the end of a long, crazy wedding day! We loved the little bouquets beside the bed that matched our wedding florals - a lovely and thoughtful touch! Their hospitality really went above and beyond what was required or expected, and we felt like special guests in their beautiful home.
Then come back and read all of the 5-star reviews! Close to Dash Point State Park with views of the water, Vashon Island and the Olympic Mountains you will not find a more luxurious and well stocked home. We will definitely return!
There are bicycles, a beach wagon, beach chair , beach umbrellas in the shed outside. You will love it!! !
She also has plates, cups, coffee, and oatmeal available. You really can't beat this place! Hotels in town are so much more expensive and don't offer all the amenities that she had.
Not only was the space immaculate, she had left us a wonderful variety of fruits, baked goods, beverages and even small samples of local ice cream. There were also a variety of tour guides and local magazines to help us find good restaurants and attractions. Susan had also prepared her own short review of some of the local restaurants which was extremely helpful.
Thank you for an easy, comfortable stay! I highly recommend and would stay here again!
Their communication is excellent and we even lost power for an hour or two and they were quick to let me know of its return. They have considered everything and even left a bottle of wine. The bed is comfy, the bathroom spacious with little amenities in case one forgets the essentials.
The location can’t be beat (especially for the price.) It is small but very private and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. If you are planning on staying inside through the entirety of your trip then you might feel cramped after a while but it is Southern California so I would hope you get out and take advantage of the proximity to the beach as well as the bicycles and beach amenities they provide for you!
They absolutely loved it. There were lots of nice touches like the jelly bean dispenser, plenty of kelvin -cups and small snacks. The fireplace and ample tv options were also great.
It's such a nice touch to have the coffee maker, kettle, and mini fridge. I come to SF a lot and this will absolutely be on my return list!
With dedicated bike lanes, it is easy and fun. She put a lot of thought into finding quality eateries.. everything from coffee shops and greasy spoon , to seafood and Mexican. Added bonus.. almost every place is within walking distance.
Melia was an amazing host, she put fresh fruit for us, coffee, milk, snacks, and more. As for Lindsay Brown it was absolutely beautiful! The touch makes it super unique and quaint, it was extremely clean, and the view was amazing.
Coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants are only 5-10 mins away (at the bottom of the hill). Laurel and Sky's place was lovely. They had everything we needed for our 2 day stay.
Paul's place was excellent; very stylish and clean. Check in was easy, and I loved being so close to the beach. We also really appreciated the access to bikes!
Alejandrina Anderson’s home is just two blocks off the beach and an easy walk to the Redondo Pier area. Alejandrina Anderson is the warmest and sweetest woman. I felt right at home and had the best sleep that I had in a very long time.
They provide everything you need; you don't have to worry about bringing shampoo or Q- tip . The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and safe. It's also walkable; restaurants, a bank, and a pharmacy are a short walk away, and you can easily drive to top attractions in Tacoma.
Ranier ( in the distance). He valued privacy, but was on hand for conversation too. There was easy access to downtown, area college campuses & hospitals.
We stayed at Wiseacre for an extended holiday weekend and family wedding in Norfolk. Enjoy!
The screened in porch with hammock where you can look out over a little tributary is so peaceful! I recommend traveling with a sleep mask if early light can wake you up as the sun does poor into the bedroom behind the shade. We went to the beach the night we arrived, which was just a short little drive, no more than 15 minutes with traffic.
Luis Hawkins is great as well. Had a great conversation with her and her husband as well, they are very friendly.
The location was perfect and we could walk to restaurants, trails, and the beach. The cottage was so cozy, clean, and decorated lovely. Our hosts were amazing and friendly and made us feel at home.
We absolutely loved our stay at Sierra's little cozy apartment. Anytime I asked a question she got back to me right away! The place was immaculate which is very important to me, it is what I look for the most in Airbnb reviews and this place did not disappoint.
Maggie’s place is in a peaceful, quiet neighborhood, which is perfect for recharging after schlepping yourself around all day. The beds were soft, the shower was hot and we had all the comforts of home even though we were far from it. Additionally, Maggie is great about quick responses and suggestions for what to do, while giving you your space.
Bed was super comfy and the amenities top notch! Michael Krieg and Jodi Stallings are the most welcoming and accommodating hosts. Michael Krieg gave us great tips for where to go and what to do in and around Hermosa and Manhattan Beach, and was very responsive if we had any questions.
i was really impressed by all the small thoughtful touches that made the space feel incredibly homey and not just a place to sleep. thank you, angela!
Small snacks (chips, granola bars) were unexpected and very welcome - we were running late for an event when we arrived and weren't sure we'd be able to eat dinner that night. Highly recommend, you'll be happy here.
Melia's topographic point was outstanding! It is in a great location, quiet neighborhood and easy to find and navigate. We did a lot in and around the city, about an hour drive anytime we went into San Francisco but that's because of bridge traffic.
From the second I saw the description of this home I was really drawn toward how beautiful it looked. I sent an electronic mail to James Walker and she responded super quick and gladly welcomed us to stay at her home. I booked it right away without any issues.
Our bed was comfortable, and  the hide-a-bed my daughter slept on was also comfortable! This is the perfect little AirBNB, and we will definitely be staying there again. We highly recommend Heather’s bungalow !
Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Laurie and Teresa Knight. Your privacy is respected, yet they remain available if you need anthing. I appreciated the tall, locked gated entry into my area, added a feeling of security.
Beach is in walking distance and the neighborhood is really nice. Elisabeth is a wonderful person, who does everything to make your stay with her perfect. The house was super clean, well equipped and I felt very much at home.
She even had beach towels, beach umbrella and anything else you may need for a trip to the beach. Betty Maust’s place may be the cut air BnB we have stayed at to date. Betty Maust is warm and welcoming and was very accommodating of our arrival time.
There even were freezer packs in the freezer. They gave us a selection of maps and Alejandrina Anderson gave us some great suggestions and detailed directions for day trip , public transportation, restaurants etc. The lovely courtyard with fish pond and plants is spectacular and the on site laundry much appreciated.
and and plenty of complimentary teas, coffee, and snacks -- PLUS the most amazing, well-stocked snack bar available for cash/ (Hidden by Airbnb) . There are even hummingbird feeder right outside the window which make for the most cheerful view. The bed is cozy and the towels are super soft.
Lenora and Ernie were warm and hospitable hosts. The room was a good size and the bed was super comfy and could comfortably fit two people. I liked how they had put a Keurig, water and little brochures of local activities and places in the bookcase.
This is a delightful cottage with everything for a relaxing stay in one cozy package. Close to the beach and many restaurants and shops but quiet. Our hosts were unobtrusive yet available and checked in with us part way through our stay.
Laura and Dennis Steward are the most gracious of host . The posted photos don't do their cozy space justice. It's spacious, impeccably clean, well-organized, and full of thoughtful touches that may it feel like you're staying with family.
Extremely clean and the host was very quick to respond/help with anything. Saved us money on Uber drive and were also just fun. Loved this place and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area!
His place is gorgeous & he includes MANY extras! The beach & stores were only block away, so it was a perfect walk each morning & I felt totally safe walking alone. I really wanted to ride a bike on the boardwalk, but didn't have time, so I guess I'll be back!
I live in Tacoma and have traveled the world for 25+ years, and must say I plan to again drive the 3 miles from my home to Christiana's studio, just to take a "stay-cation". Only thing that was unexpected is that the beds are water beds. First for me to sleep on one, and it was quite different.
The bathrobes and slipper they provide are also a nice touch! I would definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in town!
The best part about staying here is difficult to choose. Louise was great--she was very responsive and respectfully available if you need anything. She also went above and beyond to provide local tips--her guidebook was amazing.
It was our first time in Tacoma. The view is what drew me to their place and when sun made an appearance sitting out on the deck and taking in the view was awesome. They have put much thought into their place and it showed.
Wow! Jennifer Merry & Mike are excellent host . They welcomed us and gave us plenty of information about the city.
We stayed at Tyler’s place for only one night before heading out of town. Space is light, modern, and good sized. Obviously newly remodeled and has a large TV which was welcoming to us after spending multiple days in the Redwoods with no electronics!
Heathers apartment was exactly as I expected it to be, it is exactly as pictured, clean and aired. Having the beach directly across the road was icing on the cake and there are some great coffee shops locally. The metro is also just a few minutes walk and can get you to pretty much anywhere you want, there are also bus stops dotted around to get you to the zoo etc very quickly.
Neva's place is a perfect studio in Redondo Beach. Looking forward to our next trip to the area so we can stay here again.
There are plenty of restaurants to go eat at if you want to eat out. Our group had 12 people and there was still space for more. :)
Nina's home was everything we could've wanted for our stay. The home itself was beautiful, spacious, well-lit, and clean. It's in a quiet, wooded neighborhood with plenty of privacy and easy parking.
Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. Towels were super soft and big. All the beds were very comfortable and the Xtra air mattress was top notch.
Can’t say enough about this rental and the host ! !
Neighborhood was quiet. Paul’s a fantastic host and it shows. His place is super clean, modern, and quiet.
The bungalow is a cozy environment with a completely stocked kitchen; comfortable furniture; quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance to food, entertainment AND beautiful walking trails and the beach is one road crossing away! The week my husband came to visit, Shantell Preusser spent time showing him around and the level of hospitality and true caring by both Shantell Preusser and Chris can NOT be beat. If you are looking for a romantic get-away or the perfect beach location for a break - I highly recommend the Ocean Park Cottage.
This topographic point is worth the money! The airplane overhead were especially loud when we stayed (which didn't bother us because we were so exhausted from the beach), but Melissa was kind enough to ask if we had slept okay. If I can, I would DEFINITELY book this room again.
In many ways, I hate to give a review like this because if people read it, they will know that this is THE PLACE to stay if you're coming to Hampton Roads. Nina met us as we pulled into their driveway and showed us to the Air B&B unit, which is a 2 bedroom apartment above a three car garage. Nina had EVERYTHING you would need, including milk in the fridge, cereal in the pantry, apple juice, a variety of Keurig flavors, and much more.
My sister and I planned our trip to Ocean Park Cottage a couple months before visiting - Lois Davis and Alejandrina Anderson were SO helpful with offering suggestions on what we could do and see while we were in town. We went hiking at First Landing State Park, went and saw the two old lighthouses close by (and also the site of the first landing), walked for miles along the beach, and ate at a few really good restaurants. We definitely want to come back - the town was charming and laid back.
His place was the perfect spot for me and my husband. It was so clean and noticeably recently updated. Shampoo/conditioner/soap in the bathroom.
It feels better than most hotels. The ocean view is unforgettable! Scott is an amazing host and we will be sure to stay here in the future.
Although the owners live upstairs this is private with it’s own entrance. Marc and Tammy are very friendly and excellent hosts. They have added some nice touches such as a Keurig with coffee pods, creams and sugar,  restaurant recommendations,   Blow dryer,  small fridge and microwave.
I could go on longer, but I'll just say that I had the best experience and the best sleep. I came to visit my daughter to celebrate a special occassion. I was looking simply for a place to rest at the end of the day.
In the evenings I enjoyed being able to walk around the lovely neighborhood and to College Ave where there were lots of nice shops and restaurants. A healthy and filling breakfast was much appreciated. The room was small but had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable for a few nights.
The location is very convenient, only 10 minutes walking distance to Hermosa beach and close to restaurant and market. Had a great time here, looking forward to next visit. Thank you!房东外出没在家,但是有帮忙照看的人在,Jesse是条温柔的狗狗,用舔来表达对人的喜爱｡院子很舒服,房间很舒服,一切都很完美｡朋友家住在附近,带孩子来看我,也说选了非常舒服的地方｡因为我因个人原因的特殊需求,Neva也帮我满足了｡位置非常方便,步行到Hermosa beach只需要十分钟｡附近吃饭买东西也都非常方便｡很期待下次继续入住｡度过了愉快的三天!感谢!
This was my first AirBnB experience and it was simply amazing  - Zeena is a fantastic host who cares for her guests in the best possible way. The breakfast was the best breakfast I ever had on the road, ever since I came to USA 2 years back. The home interiors are very artistic, well maintained and super clean and the location is perfect from all the crowd and bunco of city life.
Nice and clean Bungalow with a nice backyard sittings to hang out at; Love the atmosphere there, Lois Davis puts on decorated lightings to lead the way in to the Bungalow;  we enjoyed it very much, and we will definite stay in if we go to Los Angeles again! An incredible place! Lois Davis was easily one of the best sweetest hosts i’ve stayed with!
Miranda Malone was welcoming and accommodating. We loved using the bikes Miranda Malone had available to ride along the strand! Thanks for a great place to stay!
Such as breakfast options, cooking supplies, and a french press for coffee lovers! After long days out in the city we enjoyed being able to cuddle up on the couch and stream some movies. We  really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it for anyone looking to explore the beauty in and around San Francisco!
The kitchen is well appointed - the lone thing not available was a microwave, but Edwin Green commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon. I recommend staying here unconditionally!
Gloria is also very responsive and makes certain you have everything you need which is so nice. At the end of a long day, grabbing a drink at one of the endless options of restaurants and bars in the area, relaxing in the huge jetted tub and then curling up in the sleep number bed is exactly what I needed. I would stay at this place again in a heartbeat and if you're staying in town, I absolutely recommend you do too!
Maggie & John are so wonderful and accommodating! For a cozy spot, this had all the conveniences that were cleverly designed in the space. We were close enough to make trips to Brooklyn and Manhattan no prob.
Thoughtful touches included a nicely designed welcome magazine orienting you to the house, facilities and neighbourhood, providing snacks, drinks, ear plugs, white noise speaker and Apple TV. He even replaced the beer in the fridge with Prosecco and Rosé after realising that we were drinking wine. The neighbourhood seems relatively safe and the cafe nearby is a great place to grab a meal and just chill.
You definitely don’t get that experience in a hotel! Bennie Dudgeon's place is amazing. Considering the fact that there aren't that many hotel outside of downtown SF, this Airbnb is better than having a hotel in the neighborhood of Bernal Heights.
This artists loft is a very special topographic point ! A fantastic spot to relax during your time in Tacoma. The hosts utilize the space as a working studio as well, so there are areas you musn't touch but this really isn't a problem given the comfy area provided for their guests.
You NEED to stay (Website hidden by Airbnb) is simply beautiful...! The location of apartment close to subway and bus stop, shops, restraurants and cafes. The apartment it self was sparkling clean, had all essentials and bit more.
I really enjoyed my stay at Dan & Traci's. I was in town on business and the location was great for driving to Oakland and El Cerrito where I was working. In the evening I enjoyed being able to walk around the lovely neighborhood and to College Ave where there were lots of nice shops and restaurants.
The apartment is exuberant and artsy; it’s got a real lived-in, make yourself at home feeling. Thanks for a lovely stay, John Mullins!
It’s well worth the climb when you see this amazing loft! We spent three nights here and our only complaint was we didn’t book it for longer. We would love to come back and plan on it in the future!
This little studio is beautifully decorated, very clean, many thoughtful touches, at a professional level  B and B! I enjoyed being greeted by Susan, and then allowed privacy, with a separate entrance and parking spot. The bed is so comfortable I didn’t want to leave, coffee and breakfast options  in the little  kitchen were very welcome, and the lovely neighborhood setting filled with trees was really nice.
Very clean, high tech room with a super comfy bed, really nice shower. Although we didn’t really use the shared space  we checked it out and it is lovely with spectacular views of the city. Only possible drawback for some guests is that the stairs are quite steep and numerous so carrying a large or heavy suitcase could be a challenge.
Jo made every accommodation we had asked for and then some. Jo how does get on our way when it was time to go I was able to make suggestions. I’m very thankful for her.
The next time I stay in Tacoma, I will definitely be staying there. The only thing I can complain about is not having enough time to enjoy this space to the fullest, since I was in town for a work event and had to leave at 7 the next morning. I booked last minute, and Gloria was very quick to respond and thorough with all instructions.
The bedroom and bathrooms were spacious and clean. There was a dedicated parking space too! If I am ever in the area and the place is available, I will absolutely stay here again.
I would definitely stay there again. Neva’s place is very close to Redondo Beach and has loads of restaurants, a large grocery, nail and hair salons nearby. Her place is clean has everything you need.
The bungalow was super cute, bantam but well furnished. Overall great experience .
The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown.
Man, it’s really hard to explain the amount of comfort, appreciation and hospitality that Brent provided. Brent went above and beyond for me and my fiancé one of the most genuine and beautiful human beings I’ve met and it was an everlasting memory staying at his home that I will not forget. Brent should be a role model for all other hosts.
We did have a full Oakland day as well, both in the immediate neighbourhood of the house as well as surrounding neighbourhoods, and another morning where we went to the awesome Grand Lake Farmer's Market, a short walk from the house. I hope to return again one day, large thank you to our hosts! !
She has done a fantastic job making sure no detail is forgotten. The garden is lovely, delightful restaurants and cafes are within walking distance, the beds are comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed our all too brief stay here. Marty herself is warm and welcoming but gives one privacy, a perfect combination.
The host are kind and attentive. They were flexible with our need for an early arrival time and offered all sorts of tip for navigating the area. The space has divine natural light, is appointed perfectly, and has lovely energy throughout.
Jeni’s condo was a true oasis! We had been traveling at Mt. Rainer National Park and were ready to feel at home.
On entering the house the first thing you see is your beautiful room with the very impressive welcome booklet. Absolutely amazing! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we are looking forward to returning to San Francisco and enjoying his hospitality.
Tammy and Marc's topographic point is just amazing! Nice location - stopping point to the beach. Room was small but excellent!
We got a wonderful nights sleep. Crystal Romero was so quick to respond and fantastic to talk to. Her restaurant/amenity suggestion list was really helpful.
Actually tried to come back on my tax return to SF but sadly it was already booked. Slept very well in the comfortable bed with divine sheets. Remember if you require a kettle to ask Teresa Knight and he will happily provide one.
I especially enjoy riding bikes and loved the trail! Spacious, modern, and equipped with everything you need. Quiet neighborhood, easy street parking, nice high ceilings.
I think you never regret if you will chose Cher Alexander's house. P.S. She has a guitar and uke 
Maggie's townhome consists of renovated "apartments"- ours had two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a little kitchenette and dining area. The beds were comfortable and K-cups were provided so we could make coffee in the morning. The townhome is about a 10 minute walk from the Rigo Park station, where you can easily get on the subway to head to Manhattan or further into Queens, depending on your activities for the day.
I love that there is a desk now, since I do have to work a bit while away. Elizabeth was super accommodating to our schedule for check-in. She responded to questions and requests in a very timely and upbeat manner.
Melia's place was outstanding! Such as breakfast option , cooking supplies, and a french press for coffee lovers! The bed was comfortable with lots of pillows and excess blankets!
If you have any questions or concerns the response is very quick. We loved it.
Being kind of young, we were a bit apprehensive about meeting him, but he put us at ease completely. He was completely un-creepy, which can sometimes be hard to find in older men as an East Asian - American. I appreciated his conversation and his exhilaration at sharing the house with us.
For those that want a real cultural Chicago experience, this topographic point is it. Book this place, you will probably want to move to Chicago.
Dorothy Moser are excellent hosts. They were great at getting back to us when we had question . The room was excellent - very modern style, super comfy bed, sparkling clean bathroom, and a super cool fan to help regulate temperature in the room.
My wife and I had a great 4 night stay. She has thought of everything and her hospitality is unmatched. We rented a car and drove to Malibu, LA and several surrounding cities including Santa Monica, Anaheim (Disneyland) and Manhattan beach.
My family came from out of town to visit and we needed a place that accommodated 5 people with plenty of room and finding this place was a gem! Roberta Hallenbeck and Merv’s place was absolutely fabulous! We arrived earlier than expected and they were very kind to let us come ahead to the place.
The shower was hot and we appreciated the tea and coffee in the morning. We also had to park on the street and move the car in the morning - which is standard for the area! Overall we really enjoyed the studio and would definitely return.
Super cute, useful, and thoughtful things like this are everywhere you turn, including in the bathroom (which had everything we needed). The breakfast my husband and I had was excellent (eggs, toast, cereal, fruit, cereal, etc), and we were allowed to eat on the deck (which was incredibly lovely). Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest.
Thank you again for everything and I would love to come stay here again the next time we visit Berkeley! This is our second stay at the cabin with gracious hosts Dennis and Amy. We chose it for the proximity to our daughter and son-in-law, but we would choose it even if we did not have family in the neighborhood.
We had wonderful experience staying in Tammy's home. It's located only two blocks away from the beach! I was glad that there were bikes, beach towels, beach chairs, and even boogie boards available to use.
We both felt super comfortable and Christine responded immediately to our questions when we checked in. Not sure what renting bikes elsewhere would have costed but the ease of use with these and being able to ride them everywhere back and forth made the trip that much better. I recommend Christine’s place for anyone visiting Virginia beach!
The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!
Dolores park is dramatic . Truly the best Oatmilk caffe latte I have had in a long time. This was a great airbnb.
We hit it off right away and even talked in kitchen for a while before I unloaded my car and got a tour of the house! Melissa have a Big heart and really loves others around her! She even took the time to write out a lengthy recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant spots were out of this world!
Scott is a great host- I give him my highest recommendation! !
He was super friendly and sweet. Gin and her family was very welcoming and friendly with their hospitality. Location is in a very safe quite neighbourhood.
Paul's place was in a very nice location and was easily accessible. It was within 2-4 blocks from the beach and there were lots of restaurants within walking distance (Cajun, Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Gastropubs and Seafood). Paul was a great host and he adds nice touches to his place!
This space was well above our expectations. The walk up can easily deter you but oh man once you walk in- your transported to another place. It is a perfectly decorated balance between stylish and homey.
But obviously it has. And it should for hosts that deserve to be successful for their attempt . For good reason.
Good location, easy walk to beach and eating topographic point . Easy parking. unit of measurement is super clean,  with basic amenities (soap, shampoo, etc.)
Treetops is a lovely space, with great natural light from windows and a skylight in the bathroom. The sitting room extends the space, with a small desk and a sofa for relaxed chatting. The bed is super soft and comfy, with a pretty quilt for extra warmth.
We checked in with a lockbox, but given our own key. We would definitely stay here again and look forward to doing so.
Amazing cordial reception . Only negative: no conditioner in shower
This was my first time staying with a superhost, and Joe certainly lived up to the designation. We got in late and he was kind, helpful, and communicated promptly and clearly. The beds and linens were super comfortable, very nicely made.
The view toward the garden in the back of the house is  amazing and the whole ambience is very peaceful. I could easily say that Pamela Drew's house is a destination on its own when visiting VA Beach area and can give the local hotels a run for their money - Pamela Drew's house is around ten times better!!! Thank you for the hospitality, Pamela Drew!
The location of the house was fantastic - it was 15 minutes or less from grocery stores, 24 hour fitness, parks, hiking trails, movie theaters, restaurants, etc. If I come back to Oakland by myself, I’d definitely stay here again.
The unit was super clean, interior decoration was lovely, and had everything I needed. Joelle is an AMAZING host. Honestly, she went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was as best as it could have been.
It has modern features and great interior design. My expectation were exceeded by Shelton Gill’s thoughtful touches. She provided breakfast and even a first aid kit!
The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers.
:) antic location, stylish loft, gracious hostess! It’s a very comfortable space and was perfect for our girls weekend.
Maggie has a comfortable and very nicely furnished apartment. The bedroom are very broad , and well equipped. The kitchen is very well  equipped with everything you need.
Also Richard Batton goes above and beyond to provide extra amenities that made us feel at home. The towel warmer was so nice!!! We can’t stop speaking about how comfortable the bed was and my gf loved the mounted television lol.
Pictures do not begin to show the beauty of this place. The private deck/ patio is nice but the swimming pool and hot tub are so awesome. The scenery around them is what makes it so relaxing.
My favorite activity was looking out the large floor-to-vaulted-ceiling windows watching the weather and lake activity. Lastly, Charlotte was a little love to have around! Quiet, affectionate and the best of pups.
My boyfriend and I spent a week in San Francisco to celebrate our anniversary and see his friend , so we wanted a place close to the city but also close to the beach. Luis Hawkins home is not only gorgeous, but super cute and comfortable. It had adorable little touch , and we especially appreciated Luis Hawkins home manual with food recommendations.
We only stayed a couple days, but the house is set up for even a 2 week-long relaxing stay. I hope we can come back soon! Literally nothing bad to say.
You walk through their beautiful garden and backyard, through their garage, and up into the spacious, well-lit space. Great for couples and families, or just the solo traveler that needs some quiet space!
She let us drop off our bags a few hours early before her already already check-in which was great! The check-in and check-out process was extremely easy. The location was pretty good, about a 15-20 minute walk to River North area.
Thank you Jerry and Teresa Knight for being such amazing hosts! And the beds and pillows were so comfortable! Will be back.
The location is perfect—close enough to San Francisco and surrounding cities but away from the chaos of the city. The little house was very clean and well kept. The outdoor shower was a great extra feature— we were a little doubtful about showering in the chilly evenings, but the hot shower with surrounding fairy lights was HEAVENLY.
She provided thoughtful extra touches; wine, coffee, snacks, even brought us donuts one morning. Her place is very comfortable and clean with a great outdoor space. We enjoyed the motorcycle she provides as well.
David & Camille’s place was warm and cozy. It had everything we needed and more. First off, the bed comforter and pillows were amazing!
Next time we’re in the area, we would love to stay here again! Chris and Luis Hawkins were wonderful!! From the very start, they answered our questions quickly and were willing to help us with each step of the planning process.
100 stars ! If you are staying in or near Redondo Beach, you will not regret staying here ! Wish I could have her as a host all the time !
Would stay again! The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The rental was in a quiet vicinity that was just a block away from the Redondo beach.
We had a great time! Chris and Tim are phenomenal hosts with plenty of information if and when you want it.
I’m taking some ideas home with me to spruce up my decor! Downtown Chicago is about a 45-55 minute Uber ride during the week. Also the host was great and I love that they texted instead of called!
There is even an outdoor shower and all sorts of beach items for guests to use. They are so knowing about the area and have countless tips for restaurants, activities and even gave us a heads up on the weather! We would absolutely stay again the next time we are in town.
I loved the loft room with its lovely linens, comfy bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light. Michael is truly a warm and thoughtful host and one who is happy to converse with his guests. And he does make the best cup of coffee!
The trampoline was a huge hit. He even had the chance to have a quick play date with their daughter (free babysitting! Ha!).
I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list. Marica was quick to respond to messages and she added so many personal touches to our stay. She added many extra thoughtful items to make you stay feel welcomed and comfy.
Shantell Preusser place is easily the nicest airb&b we have stayed in. The suite is so cozy and welcoming and beautifully furnished and there are so many thoughtful touches throughout from small caramels at the bedside to fresh difficult boiled eggs, pastries and fruit for breakfast. Her communication was excellent, the space was spotlessly clean and comfortable, and she provided lists of local places for breakfast, dinner, happy hours, etc - it was such a welcoming and beautiful space and we will definitely come again when in the area.
Check in was easy, the place was spotless and very well thought out. The bathroom is a bit cozy, but again very clean and a great place to stay! Location is perfect for walking down to the waterfront.
This place is wonderful! I’m taking some ideas home with me to spruce up my decor! The location at first I thought was in a gritty neighborhood but it turned out nice, there’s a grocery store just a block away too which is nice.
Debra Dibble’s topographic point is 2 block from the beach and about a 5 minute walk from the business district Hermosa area. This place is absolutely perfect! Clean, cozy, private, amenities, bicycles, coffee machine, microwave and a small fridge in the room.
Check in was really easy. And they had all these refreshment , bite and drinks there for us on the arrival which made a cold New York day really warm. One of our best Airbnb experience !
You do have access to the beach, however. There are adirondack chairs set out and there's a short set of steps from the yard down to the beach. And the view there IS expansive!
It was a quick walk to the beach to watch the evening sunset. Parking on site and access to bikes are a definite bonus! T was communicative, quick to respond, and ensured I had everything needed for my stay.
Proctor Cottage is an excellent value and I highly recommend it. It is well located with easy access to businesses and highways but still quiet and private. The little cottage is beautiful inside and out.
Jennifer Merry even allowed a 45 mins late check out because we had a last minute meeting that we needed to finish before leaving. !
We loved that we could control the AC since I get cold very easily and the area was very quiet. Ewa’s place in Chicago was perfect! The private parking lot in the back was a major plus and the area was very safe and trendy with lots of shops and restaurants up Milwuakee Ave. Ewa provided many different amenities when we checked in and lots of useful local tips.
Great place! My friends and I booked Chuck's place for a fun weekend at VA beach. We didn't know that there was a music festival going on at the same time but Chuck let us know and recommended some great beaches at the Chesapeake Bay that were not crowded at all.
with coffee maker, electric refrigerator , and fresh water. I like the way that our space was separate from the hosts' space, yet they were totally available. BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.
Lori Stewart was really good at answering our questions and giving us advice of places near by. There are plenty of restaurants to go eat at if you want to eat out. Over all, I would recommend this place to anyone, you won't regret it.
As a guest you have your own entrance, control of the thermostat, and a short ton of storage. The space is used very well in this home and doesn’t leave you feeling cramped. Richard Batton’s home is located a few blocks from restaurants, bars, and some light shopping (Target, Trader Joe’s, TJ Maxx, Urban Outfitters).
The room is very broad . Since I was relocating I had more stuff than just traveling. They were gracious enough to let me check in early since I was coming from overseas.
This topographic point is lovely. It’s a very clean and well restored apartment. The windows are about at land level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground degree .
Tiana responded to every message I sent within minutes and she was very considerate and genuinely wanted to make sure we arrived safely and seamlessly. I would definitely come back to stay! Thank you so much Tiana!
Lauren Jensen and Greg are excellent hosts with a top-notch location. Lauren Jensen was always fast to reply to messages and was very nice to interact with in person. The unit was super clean, decor was lovely, and had everything I needed.
Although, we had our own supply it was just convenient knowing that the supplies were there if we needed it. Last, but not least the sky view of the place is absolutely breathtaking. How beautiful to wake up to and go to sleep to the beautiful view.
I would definitely come back to their residence again, and you will not be disappointed! My girlfriend and my experience at Star and Debra Dibble’s place was better than expected. Star and Debra Dibble were responsive and were accurate in their description.
Heather cares about her guests and seems to continuously improve the experience. We had a lovely stay and recommend the cozy cottage for others.
We really appreciated the kitchen that came fully equipped with everything we could need to cook dinner along with coffee pot, cereal in the pantry, some food items in the fridge/freezer, and plenty of coffee and extras. :) The pool and hot tub were amazing and very clean. Nina and Merv even provided beach towels and washed a load of towels for us while we were there!
This is a wonderful little find on a quiet street, just a few steps from the sand, but within easy walking distance of the bars and restaurants of Hermosa and Redondo. The bed was wonderfully comfortable, full cable tv and a large and well-equipped bathroom. Would definitely try to book again if I wanted to go back to Hermosa.
I can’t say enough good things here! The studio is clean, comfortable and has a spectacular view of Commencement Bay. Christiana’s personal touches make it extra special, fresh flowers, and snacks.
The apartment is very fresh and clean. There is a wonderful garden which is an oasis of peace in the busy city of Chicago. The location is great, only a 5 to 10 minute walk from Division & Milwaukee CTA subway station.
The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!
The breakfast! It was wonderful and held us over until lunch. We took the bikes to Berkeley campus and enjoyed the ride.
We will try to stay again when we return to Forest Hills. Igor's place has a nice ambiance and was very clean. The room was perfect for my needs...doing some work (good wifi!)
We especially loved that it was only a couple of street away from Ocean Beach and the spectacular Sea Cliff bluff . We took regular walks along the coastline, and were happy to be able to come “home” in the evening to a place that was very comfortable and inviting. In all, we had an amazing time, and would highly recommend his place to others.
Everything was very clean and functional. What a great place to stay, very clean and easy access to the beach. The owners are very responsive and communicate very well with check in instructions and are readily available to assist you with any questions you may have about the area.
The kitchen and living areas are comfortable (only two chairs at the table, though) and nicely decorated. Communication with Jeanna was fabulous -- we had a couple of small issues, and she addressed them immediately. A few notes for the faint of heart: The stairs leading up to the space are indeed steep (worth it, we thought).
It was a 20 min drive to all the "touristy" things we wanted to do & a 5 min walk to the nearest bus stop. We loved the little book of suggestions that she had, also. Her TV was connected to netflix so it was nice to relax before bed while watching our favorite shows.
The kitchen is nicely appointed, there are plenty of game and movies available, and there is even a great outdoor living space! I love waking up to the water and mountain views! Although I have heard rumors that it always rains in Seattle, we had perfect weather this past week.
Arnold Jackson’s place is simply the best value for an entire space listing all around the Puget Sound. My friend and I were blown away. Arnold Jackson is a perfect host as well.
Paul and his family has done an amazing job with their very private guesthouse. As my partner and I were riding beach cruisers (on loan to us and included in our stay) down the pier (as Paul suggested in his well thought out Guestbook) we passed by loads of hotels. We would never have had as nice a trip if we had stayed in a hotel.
Close to Train Station. Hope to see you again.
So relaxing, and cozy! Such a sweet little place.
Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at. Shantell Preusser made us feel as though we were the only people to have ever slept, showered or ate there, it really is that clean. The apartment has incredibly thoughtful touches throughout, all the luxury amenities one could need.
She even took the time to write out a lengthy recommendation list based off my interest and her restaurant spots were out of this universe ! :) I also got to meet her daughter who is home some of the time and she also has the sweetest of spirits! It was a short trip but Visited the Beach, Boardwalk and The Navy seal monument which was pretty profound!
We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. Joe's place is a great place to stay! The bedroom is very simple with a large bed for two, two chairs, a full length mirror, a bedside table, and a lamp.
The suite is massive, modern, well-outfitted and an excellent value. While the suite lacks a kitchen, it does have everything you'll need to make coffee, tea or to heat up leftovers, etc. The building was easy to find and check-in and check-out were fast and painless.
The room was clean, linens were fresh, and there more than enough towels and washcloths made available. Overall, a great stay in Redondo - I would highly recommend staying here.
Really appreciated the private patio area too. Bikes were a little tricky to ride when you’re not used to “chopper”style handlebars and are accustomed to handbrakes. But definitely a very nice space.
Cher Alexander and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. Oh, and don't miss the position !
Right. Now. Until next time Charismatic Roberta Hallenbeck and Charming Charlotte.
Tiana was an amazing host. She was so prompt to response to our text messages and was such a sweetheart— so willing to go above and beyond to make us comfortable & or experience worth the stay. The cottage house was THEE MOST CUTEST, most COMFORTABLE, and ADORABLE thing EVER.
This was also their first stay in an Airbnb, which they were a little hesitant about. Jennifer Merry preemptively asked about any special likes or dislikes my parent and then went above and beyond to provide great touches like pastries from a wonderful local bakery, coffee, fruit, etc. My parents were blown away and had an amazing time!
Her place is absolutely adorable and very comfortable. She greeted me at my arrival to show me around and answer any questions. She was very warm and welcoming.
This is a great apartment. It's super clean and comfortable, feels very private, and came stocked with breakfast items, excess tolitries, and sparkling water, all which were great touches. We enjoyed the patio/yard area.
WOW! The bed was comfy, the neighborhood is great, and now my wife wants to move to Redondo Beach. Thanks so much, the only down side was that we had to leave.
Apartment is cozy, clean, and with all needed amenities. You will simply love the location of this home. You are located one of the coolest areas in San Francisco, Mission Delores in the Robert Turpen district and there is so much to see & so many places to eat.
Marcos Blount and Marc were very helpful with everything. We found Marcos Blount's Place and it was perfect for our needs. We wanted something close enough to walk to and from the Beach.
I will definitely be recommending her place to anyone who comes to visit and needs a local topographic point to stay. Everything was perfect. Especially the host was so welcoming and even everyday she asked whether there is something to help.
The check-in procedure was easy. The house was very clean. It’s very nice that it has a private parking space.
We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the bite Bob and Sharann left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen. SUPER CLEAN, marvelous hospitality and the extra touches were superb. The location is just off of I-5 and there is everything you could possibly need right nearby.
Very clean and nicely decorated. It was a bit of a tight space for 4 adults but definitely accomplishable ! Overall very lovely!
The house is spotless! It’s a beautiful modern tastefully decorated clean guesthouse. Shower was very warm, water pressure was perfect, they have everything you need for your stay—hair drier, iron board, heater, ref-ridge.
Not far from the beach and well located for any of the beach attractions. She was extremely responsive to any inquiry and check-in was easy. Her cottage is clean with comfy bed.
I loved my time at John Brashier beach bungalow. Edward Ramsey greeted me warmly with her ace sweet doggie. I felt (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was easy and clear.
She messaged a couple days prior to update us on our early check in request, checked in with us after we arrived to make sure we were able to settle in and to see if we needed anything. If my travels bring me back to the area, I will most certainly look to rebook here!
Clean, cozy, private, amenities, bicycles, coffee machine, microwave and a small electric refrigerator in the room. I just loved meeting them and their place!
So very accessible into the city...  And a hop on the LIE for a drive to Long Island. Whether it's for business or pleasure, Shantell Preusser place is PERFECT. I will be back again and hope it is available!
Quick Communication Time and an even greater place to stay. The bikes were a nice touch, We rode them up and down Venice Beach which is two blocks away. I LOVED the manner and how clean it was.
Angela goes out of her way to make her guests feel welcome,  from fresh squeezed orange juice in the fridge to face masks in the bathroom. I was in LA for a work conference but the walking distance to the pier and beach let me have some much needed vacation time. Would love to stay here again- highly recommend.
All the things you want - good communication, easy check in and out, convenient parking, a beautiful and comfortable space to call "home" for awhile. And then she goes beyond all that and stocks the electric refrigerator with delightful foods, thoughtfully selected, so you can enjoy your breakfast or a snack and get a "taste" of the local fare. You won't find a more thoughtful or helpful host or a lovelier space for you stay.
Highly recommended! Betty Maust is a fantastic host. Her beautiful home has everything you need.
He worked hard to make sure April and I had everything that we needed, which exceeded our expectations. Tyler spoke to April and I to see what our interests were in food and entertainment then proceeded to make suggestions for food in the Mission District, as well as other places around San Francisco. Our main reason for visiting the area was to attend an Oakland Raiders game.
This cute guest house is the perfect beach spot. Only a block away from beach access and 10 minutes or less walk to great restaurant and shopping. The guest house was very clean and spacious.
The bathrobes and slippers they provide are also a nice touch! The speaker system is GREAT, and overall you can just tell that they love their home and want other guests to feel that way as well. Plus, there’s just something very charming and nostalgic about sleeping in a loft that I love.
The outdoor space is really pretty at night. She even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy by the fire! Robert Huckabaa was incredibly hospitable and all of the small touches really made the weekend.
No one was cramped. Played a lot of different games as well that we set up and borrowed from Chuck. It is amazing everything you might have forgotten to bring he has and shares with you.
Elizabeth’s place was great for our weekend beach getaway! The room is very large and offers a double vanity sink, large shower and a nice balcony to sit on and take in the views. Coming and going was very easy.
Overall, we have nothing but positive memories. Will be back if we are lucky enough to be in the big apple again.
Christian and Jackie are lovely people who offer a warm welcome into their home. The littles extras such as coffee, homemade bread and jam and fruit was a lovely touch to making us feel comfortable in their home. We had the small bedroom off the kitchen area and the bed was so comfortable.
It was perfect for me traveling alone but know that you basically have just the bed and a tiny bathroom. Overall, this is an awesome topographic point , particularly if you're just looking for a place to crash between LA touring and beach living!
Just steps from the beach, but close enough to any sights to see in San Francisco, I couldn't have asked for a better location. The home itself is perfect, equipped with a kitchen, sitting room, bedroom and bathroom. Not to mention the gardens around the home are stunning.
The little treats and awesome tv options were great for evenings in with our little guy. Angela is the greatest host! Took my son to SoCal for his birthday/spring break and we decided on Angela’s place.
The perfekt Airbnb Experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We felt very comfortable with Angela. Her home is easy to reach and is very close to the beach. With the wheels you can explore everything super nice.
But the thing that puts her place over the top is her attention to detail. Granola and fresh fruit and goodies from a nearby bakery. A touch of chocolate and bedside caramels.
Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay. Tyler has clearly put a batch of effort into ensuring his place feels like a hotel, but to be honest it didn’t feel like a hotel, it felt so much better - a home. Tyler provided us with all the space we required but was also available for any questions and tips as we needed them and after meeting him and his partner we feel like we now have a couple of new lifelong friends.
Nice host, thanks so much. I stayed at Elizabeth’s place after getting in from a long flight, before driving home the next day. It is close to LAX and if looking for a great place in LAs South Bay I would definitely recommend her home.
I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list. Raquel Eastham was quick to respond to messages and she added so many personal touches to our stay. She added many extra thoughtful items to make you stay feel welcomed and comfy.
The space is really nice. It’s light, very well equipped and has a lovely little seating area looking out at a sweet garden. Dennis Steward met us personally and was lovely.
She allowed us to keep our luggage in the space until we headed to the airport and indicated that if she ended up needing the place earlier, she’d store it at her home for us. I absolutely loved The Loft. I have to say it is one of my favorite places I have stayed.
Her home is immaculately clean, the room is spotless, and the linens and towels are sanitized before each guest. You are greeted and welcomed by Zeena into her home as if you are family and she takes care of your needs as such, maybe even better. Breakfast was wonderful and there are several options.
Debra Dibble was fantastic. She is very friendly and the space exceeded our expectations. Great room with plenty of space and private bath.
It is beautifully decorated and the hosts have thought of everything! It is one of my very favorite AirBnB experience .
One thing to consider- there is 1 bathroom and it is centrally located. I sometimes felt like I wished I could lock the bathroom door for privacy- but it wasn’t that large of a deal. I would totally go back!
This is one of the best properties we've stayed in for a few reasons: great location, value, quality of space and amenities provided. This all made our stay exceptionally easy and Tiana was wonderful to work with! Awesome property!
Esmie's place (Casa 2 we stayed in) was a dream come true Airbnb! Details: The bed was like a marsh mellow cloud from heaven, and I fell asleep so quickly I actually thought I was at home when I woke up! The whole room is beautifully decorated in a balanced, peaceful way (there is an actual theme, versus random), that obviously was thoughtfully put together.
Angela is the best! Everything was thought up! Cozy little house with a beautiful yard just for us!
The bed in the main bedroom is comfy. The bathroom is the only space that feels small but it’s not a big deal. The location is a short drive from several museums although it’s far away from stores and restaurants.
The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. We didn't get to meet Christopher Brown in person but we met his son who graciously helped us with late-night check-in. Both were very kind and professional, we felt like we were in good hands :) hope to be back in the future!
Any question we had, they answered right away and they were so helpful with all their suggestions for things to do. And a basket filled with ideas and suggestions for restaurants and places to go, each with hand written notes. I highly recommend staying here.
Would love to come back when my daughter goes to university. Definitely walking distance to UPS and only 1.5 mile or a 20 minute walk to the bay. Gorgeous stay.
She stated that even though she knew it was a safe neighborhood, she wanted to make sure her guests felt safe at all times. I almost forgot to mention that it was only 8 minutes away from my sister's home. There was no type of traffic compared to the DC metropolitan area.
She has done a antic job making sure no detail is forgotten. The garden is lovely, delightful restaurants and cafes are within walking distance, the beds are comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed our all too brief stay here. Marty herself is warm and welcoming but gives one privacy, a perfect combination.
And her house also happens to be comfortable and well positioned in Long Beach. Just a  short walk to the ocean. If you'd like to have the best stay in Los Angeles choose her place.
There are six outlets, and although only four of them work, that's plenty for one room. The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. The towels he provides are very soft and very plentiful.
For this trip, I was lucky to be able to book my husband and his brother in at my fave place in Tacoma. My husband is a man of few words...and fewer superlatives. But below is all him:  Our stay at Crystal Romero’s place was fantastic.
Also provided is a space heater, which works well, an  umbrella and a flashlight. I highly recommend staying here!
If you are lucky enough to find this place open for the dates you're considering, snap it up! We had a wonderful time here. It's walking distance around the corner from a restaurant + bar (Hudson House) owned by Top Chef alum Brooke (we went for dinner twice), and walkable to a lot of other wonderful espresso/coffee places.
What a great space, thoughtful touches with snacks, such comfortable sheets and comforters with many pillows. Everything was just as described. Quiet and a great set up for me, my 11 year old son and my sister as we explored New York City.
We enjoyed every element of our stay at Diane's place and hope to be back again soon! The house is spotless! It looks way better than the photos.
We only had two days to explore SF so we only used this room as a base but would love to have spent more time here. James Walker has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience. The house was impeccably clean, the room was quiet and private, the check in was seamless and convenient.
This place is perfect for a family vacation. The house is on the beach and that makes everything so easy when you have a 2 years old with you. Brent's place was spotless, very cozy and made us feel like home.
Geneva is quick to respond to messages and flexible. Jeneva’s cabin was so wonderful to stay in! I really liked all of the sticky notes, those were extremely helpful especially for the shower.
It was so wonderful to have a chance to stay with Zeena again... and a great way to introduce my husband to Airbnb! Loved the new addition of snacks and water in the room! And then there is her homemade breakfast....
The room itself is bigger than I expected, which was nice as my husband ended up needing to do some work. We felt this spot was a super value and we would come back to it the next time we find ourselves in the area. And I highly recommend a low-key bike ride up and down The Strand.
Thank you Arnold Jackson and Lois Davis, we'll certainly have you at the top of our list when we're back in Tacoma again Proctor Cottage was truly our home away from home. The hosts paid attention to every singe detail.
Only met Neva briefly but she was so nice and I would have enjoyed to spend a bit more time more her for sure if she wasn't heading to Whistler for a ski :) Neva described her place completely accurately. It's a terrific location to enjoy Lindsay Brown and Michael Krieg on foot, or explore the whole South Bay with a car.
My favorite activity was looking out the large floor-to-vaulted-ceiling windows watching the weather and lake activity. Lastly, Charlotte was a little love to have around! Quiet, affectionate and the best of pup .
This was our second visit to Ben and  Michael's place. Both Ben and Michael are great hosts. The B&B is completely self contained and has everything needed for a comfortable stay.
Very easy check-in and Stephanie is super responsive and helpful. She is very thoughtful and her space contains a lot of nice touches. Would love to come back when my daughter goes to university.
I really enjoyed my stay at Dasha & Owen's place. I stayed two nights, while on business. It was great to be able to prepare a meal and stay in and work one evening, rather than eat out.
Very cozy and quaint. Snacks were available. It was wayyy better than we expected.
Lots of beach toys available on site to use. This was a wonderful experience all the way around! Tiana was a great hostess who was always there to provide for our every need!
We can not thank her enough for this generosity. Kitchen was well equipped and has nice appliances and countertops. The TV is great place to relax after a long day hiking or exploring!
Elizabeth is friendly and prompt. I loved having a small balcony for outdoor space, the bed and linens and bath were scrumptious and I wish I have more time both visiting with her and staying in her lovely home.
We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you again for everything (Website hidden by Airbnb) ❤ (Website hidden by Airbnb) Staci & Devin
Maggie’s place was the best Airbnb apartment I’ve ever been to. Its Interieur was beautifully and thoughtfully arranged. It was also very clean and it has everything you need for you stay and to feel home.
This is an urban setting with typical urban noise except that the train tracks are very close and when a train comes through the noise is pretty loud. My daughters played pool, on the Richard Batton, did homework on the computer and we had fun listening to music on the record player provided! The space is so clean and the location is so handy when attending events at the Tacoma Dome.
We had a lovely stay at Elizabeth Jones's place! The check-in process was super easy. The room was super clean and decorated so beautifully!
Berkeley is such a cool pocket of NorCal, this place is PERFECT for exploring and enjoying all the city has to offer. This place is so cozy comfy, equipped with all the essentials that make it feel like a home, and hosted by the loveliest folks. Justin was so easy to communicate with — he eased all our concerns and ensured our stay was enjoyable.
Tiana was the best host, so kind! Will definitely be back!
The house is sparkling clean, the room is lovely with plenty of space and the door room can be locked with a code which is a nice addition. Lovely home a short walk from Redondo Beach (access via Torrance Blvd). It is on a somewhat busy road during the day but at night we didn't have any problems with noise.
There were plenty of blankets, extra towels, and pillows. I didn't have to worry about my son getting cold at night. There was a full fridge, microwave, toaster oven, hot plate for cooking, plenty of dishes for eating.
Our clean, bright and comfy room was more wonderful than we had hoped for. Very helpful hostess and nice kitchen to make snacks and morning coffee! You'll love it!
Joelle's space is beautiful and amazing! Me and my bf had work to get done during the trip, and it was amazing sitting out in the sunshine with a glass of wine and our laptops. Downtown SF is an east 20-30 min drive.
The Aloha house is simply perfect! Warm welcome even if we didn't have the opportunity to meet Troy and Attina. Communications were clear and responses came quite quickly and were loaded with useful information about the house and also about our visit in Seattle.
Thomas George’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Robert Huckabaa and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick response , ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay.
Their place was spotless and so very comfortable. My husband wants me to ask them the brand of comforter on the bed, he loved it very much.
The neighborhood is beautiful. Fell asleep in an instant it was so comfy. During our stay we ate at The Good Stuff and Phanny’s.
This place has all the small touches that makes an airbnb awesome! T is a fabulous, communicative host. Thank you again!
This is a lovely apartment and Ron and Lauren Jensen are very accommodating hosts. The apartment is within a short walk of a number of restaurants and shops and Joan Litwin suggestions for restaurants were great. In fact we had one of the best meals while we were in the SF/Berkeley area at Luca Cucina, which is a short walk from the apt.
She gave us a tour of the room and told us everything we needed to know. She was great. The room was sparkling clean and very very big and spacious.
The guest house was neat and homey, decorated very cute. One downside is that it is over a garage, so it can be a little smelly when walking up to the bedroom. It smelled fine in the actual place where we stayed.
I am relatively small so the place was fine for me but someone larger/taller may have some issues with the house as it is pretty compact. Otherwise Neva was awesome and I'd definitely recommend the place!
Neva and her topographic point are perfect!!! Prime location, beautiful neighborhood, home and guesthouse. Neva was super quick with communication and happy to help with anything we needed.
Communication was great, Tyler gave a ton of amazing recommendation . When we explored beyond the Mission district, we took Ubers pretty much everywhere (super easy) but I’m sure public transport would’ve been equally convenient. The room has everything you need - EVERYTHING!
I'm not going to bury the lede on this one: the toilet lights up. That's all I needed to start the petition for 10 stars on Airbnb. Now to the boring part of the review: Debra Dibble and Roberta Hallenbeck's suite was exactly what I was looking for on my one-night stay.
There was a great variety of shops and restaurants nearby - our favourite was a little hole-in-the-wall doughnut shop called Dream Fluff Donuts. The cottage is very quiet, clean and well equipped - everything is exactly as in the AirBnB pictures and description. Lois Davis is very friendly and available if needed but is respectful of our privacy.
The value is unbeatable, especially compared to other places (Airbnbs/hotels alike) in San Francisco. It’s a nice older home, located in a good area, within walking distance to plenty of awesome places. Brenda had good suggestions and was very helpful with any questions I had.
Perfect for what we needed. Great stay! John Mullins sent me a message detailing the check in process which was very easy to follow.
Lori Stewart home is beautiful, not to mention, spotless clean! She was fast at responding my request and was very clear with check-in and out instructions. Very comfortable stay and definitely enjoyed being near the beach!
Elizabeth was very friendly and nice to talk to. If you're staying in the beach area, I recommend staying at her place due to location and comfort.
This was also their first stay in an Airbnb, which they were a little hesitant about. Susan preemptively asked about any special likes or dislikes my parent and then went above and beyond to provide great touches like pastries from a wonderful local bakery, coffee, fruit, etc. My parents were blown away and had an amazing time!
Chris and Tim are like the neighbors you would always hope to have— they are incredibly friendly, helpful, and very easy to get along with! The cottage (aka OPC) is quaint and cozy, and it is the perfect size for any couple looking for a beach getaway! We ended up bringing a computer to watch Netflix during the times we were rained in or between activities (I.e.
I phoned my family every other day. Thanks for having us in your lovely abode. Alan  and Ruth McGuffog
The first thing I will say is: Book Susan's place! You will not be sorry. The space is very comfortable and spacious and spotlessly clean.
If you’re visiting San Francisco for the first time I absolutely recommend staying at Tyler’s home, just make sure you check out Outerlands (across the street) for the best brunch in the city! Tyler’s place is great and even if you travel with kids, 4 people can fit easily. Tyler replies fast to any question and finds a solution to any issue that might arise.
The space is exactly as described. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's "Working" in the bathroom.
Location was perfect. We loved the scenic views and appreciated the quiet residential area after our long days of exploring the city. The topographic point is nicer than the picture .
Not to mention the gardens around the home are arresting . Heather was very communicative and welcoming, and had an answer to any question I had. I will absolutely be returning to San Francisco, and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!
As an individual guest, I found this space to be absolutely perfect. Tony and Attina have  laid out the minimal space in such a way that all needs were met -- beyond what I had expected. And sitting out on their deck on a cool spring evening was just the "bee's knees".
T’s beach cottage was my first airbnb experience and it was amazing! First, it was an outstanding location: $22 lyft from airport, 5 min walk to the beach, 2 minute walk to food places, 10 minute walk to a bunch of shops. Second, the property was lovely: crisp and clean, the bed was really comfortable, and it was stocked with coffee and tea, cookware, and spices/oils/herbs for cooking.
It was sparkling clean and stocked with everything you’d need from keurig coffee and granola bars to maps and information about the city. I appreciate their recommendations for the area and their help carrying my luggage up the hill and back from where I parked. Love that there is street parking!
Cara’s Airbnb is one of the best we’ve stayed in. There is a train path nearby and once in a while you can hear the train going by, but the noise didn’t bother us. Thank you again for everything and I would love to come stay here again the next time we visit Berkeley!
Dan & Traci are also really great host ! (her Quiche is a must-try btw). Overall, my sister and I had a wonderful experience at their lovely home and would definitely recommend to you future travelers!
This truly feels like slice of paradise. The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemons! The cottage was immaculate, very comfortable, and had everything we needed.
The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. There were no spaces ignored. It’s obvious these owners really care about the space and your stay- they checked in with us on a few occasions.
Thank you Jerry and Julie for being such amazing hosts! The home was immaculate and is very well taken care of. Being able to look out on the water while enjoying our dinner was absolutely amazing.
We loved this topographic point ! We would definitely recommend this place!
The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 minute to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Pamela Drew recommended an architecture boat tour which was fabulous .
Tyler was easy to communicate with and gave good recommendations for topographical point to eat. I would definitely stay here again.
Trent was ecstatic that you had three different contraptions to brew coffee (he prefers the French press) and did a very childish happy dance when he saw you had fancy sugar cubes. We were kind of thankful it was still winter and wondered if we would even be able to see the sound when your neighbors’ trees bloom back with leaves! We really appreciated all the little details you put in to make this spot special.
Being a loft apartment, the bedroom isn't the most private but it was fine for me. His flamboyant rooftop is certainly a highlight of the place, especially if the weather is good. One of the most memorable moments of my trip was sitting out on the rooftop with a very friendly couple who were also staying with Robert Turpen through airbnb.
Remember if you require a kettle to ask Jeff and he will happily provide one. Two recommendations - for great coffee and breakfast around the cnr visit Jane Cafe which opens early and Delfina Pizzeria for a casual dinner just next door.
Angela’s place is perfect for a solo traveler or a couple. It had amazing touches (record player!) and was overall great.
We stayed at Ron and Laurie’s place when we were helping with day care for our granddaughter in the area. Some of those special touches included fresh flowers,  fresh ground coffee, homemade granola and containers of Greek yogurt for breakfast, evening snacks (cookies and tea), and a lovely patio,  The location was GREAT — a block from the 4th Street area in Berkeley, where we always enjoy spending time at our visits to Berkeley. They clearly labeled items as to their location and how various things worked.
We would definitely go back to Angela. she and her beautiful home made our trip perfect.
I appreciated his conversation and his excitement at sharing the house with us. He's a lovely, kind man World Health Organization doesn't unnecessarily interfere with his guests and makes sure that we treat the house as if we were his roommates. I felt at ease and well rested at Sheri Vowell place!
The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. Tyler stays on the third floor of the house. Free parking on the street  and we were always able to find a spot.
the space is roomy, clean, and welcoming. the tv has a Fire stick on it so you can access all your favourite apps for television, along with SlingTV for regular channels. Ian was very responsive when we needed questions asked, which we really appreciated.
Neva's topographic point was great! Clean, comfortable and great location! I appreciated the amenities she left for us (snacks, water, soap, lotion, tooth brushes, etc.)
Not to mention the gardens around the home are stunning. Heather was very communicative and welcoming, and had an answer to any question I had. I will absolutely be returning to San Francisco, and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!
Marc's place was perfect for our 2 night stay in San Francisco . The place was clean, checkin and checkout were very easy, communication was prompt and detailed, and the location was perfect - we were able to walk pretty much everywhere that we wanted to see. We also really appreciated the option for day parking passes since we had our car with us and didn't want to move it since we were out and about on foot the whole time.
Would gladly stay again! 5 Star Review for 5 Star Hosts  My husband is having a series of surgeries near by and having Kara and Nick’s place to come back to was a retreat at the end of some stressful days. The property is as described and then some, though it rained I was not able to sit outside on the lovely deck, I did get to see some wildlife, a hawk and an eagle.
There is a refrigerator, desk, tv, and travelers information about getting around San Francisco. Basically anything we will need during our stay. The place was very clean, stylish, and homely.
There were extra blankets, which was fantastic. The temperature of the place was my only complaint as there is no Central heat or air, however he provided a radiator to heat and a fan to cool. Tyler was easy to communicate with and gave good recommendations for places to eat.
A truly unique space, rustic yet urbane, with every detail you could think of - even the outdoor shower was quaint and cosy. Listening to live jam sessions was an added bonus! We felt right at home, and we were glad to have taken a friend’s recommendation to book this location.
Thanks again for offering a fantastic place to stay. Thomas George’s home was our first Airbnb experience. We weren’t sure what to expect but she was there to greet us and as she walked us through her home I was absolutely floored!
I was made to feel completely at home, being offered a bath with some yummy bath salts, and full access to her gorgeous kitchen and everything it had to offer. I really enjoyed my stay at Christina’s place. She made it felt just like home.
They also offered a variety of tea and starbucks ground coffee--as well as sugar, cream pitcher etc. A coffee maker and electric kettle rounded the entire thing out! In the fridge, a filtered water pitcher waits for you, already filled.
It’s very close. We would definitely stay here again. They have set a high bar for what to expect for future stays with AirBnB!
Had a great time here, looking forward to next visit. Neva’s topographic point is so amazing. It’s cozy!!
Also the the beach is minutes away. She was very friendly and kind and parking is easy here and should have no problem.
She was a terrific resource for local eateries and things to do, and knowing our interest in glass art, she procured a pass to the Museum of Glass in Tacoma! We plan to stay here again during our next trip to Tacoma!. Thank you, Jo.
The view was to die for!! She was quick to answer and had everything we could even want! We loved the snacks that she provided as well as the convince of the honor bar that was fully stocked!
Very generous, thank you!! Michael Krieg was AMAZING!! My parent were visiting from out of town for their first trip to the Seattle/Tacoma area and to meet my fiance for the first time.
This topographic point was awesome! It had a private entrance, small patio, and bikes etc available. The bed was very comfortable.
Great place to stay for anyone visiting LA. Beach bikes available to use, clean space, newly remodeled and stylish, mini electric refrigerator and coffee maker in the space. Easy check in and check out.
Paul was a great host with amazing recommendations for anyone unfamiliar with the area! Cozy, quiet, pretty space. I met Paul - he's very friendly.
We arrived a bit earlier than expected and my phone failed to send the ETA message to Sierra but she let us drop our things off and freshen up which was deeply appreciated. It was quiet and had plenty of street parking. The apartment itself was cutely decorated and very homey.
Kelly's place was perfect to stay for me and my husband! Michael Krieg clean and very well located! You have your own privacy and street parking wasn't terrible either!
This is a wonderfully convenient, artsy and comfortable place to stay. Spotless, well appointed, really great bed, and amazing art work everywhere! Ewa is immediately responsive and provides a lovely and thorough welcome.
Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach. and borrow them. She also had good suggestions on local places to go, restaurants and pubs etc.
It was broad and we never felt crowded. Betty Maust' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc!
Diana was the ultimate host! She was both friendly and professional. Her seasonableness when I thought I was locked out was also fantastic.
Paul is a great Airbnb host. Thanks Paul!
T was amazing! The cottage is just as cute and bright as it looks online! Lori Stewart comfy bed and sofa .
Angela’s place is spotless and in an excellent location, with the shops around the corner, water across the road and beaches a short bike drive away! She’s super thoughtful and the topographic point is really cozy. I will not hesitate to book this place again.
We found Francis Jones's Alejandrina Anderson and it was perfect for our needs. Her place is clean and comfortable and she also had Bikes to ride if you wanted to. We couldn't have asked for a better Host.
From the initial communication and all the way through my stay she was exceptionally responsive and accommodating to all of our needs. Her cottage is simply charming and extremely clean with every amenity you could want. The use of her cruiser bikes, towels etc.
They are excellent hosts who are kind, considerate, and thoughtful. They provide a coffee maker in the room, and breakfast items in the kitchen each morning, which is such a great help. Lenora puts flowers from their garden in your room, which is a lovely and thoughtful touch.
The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level. We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the ground floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private.
Easy to park, clean, large and comfortable room and the perfect location blocks from the beach (perfect for my morning run). Very close to the beach, quite neighborhood. Edwin Green is very kind and warm person, very easy to communicate and quick response.
This is my third stay at Rayford Kelly's topographic point , which has now become my NYC base! Rayford Kelly is welcoming and the place is spotless, comfortable and well connected. I totally recommend it.
The cottage itself was cute, cozy and comfortable. He was a very personable and genuinely nice guy. Communication was very easy and although everything ran smoothly we felt like if anything had arisen Linda and Dan would be very easy to reach and take care of anything within their power.
My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions.
Thanks Tammy and Marc! !
Teresa Knight personal touches make it extra special, fresh flowers, and snacks. This is now my home away from home while in Tacoma. I sure appreciate having such a nice topographic point to stay while I’m in town.
Very clean. Everything I needed for a couple nights in Tacoma. And fun to look around at the art they are creating in the space when its not being rented to outside folks.
We felt like we were guests of Mark and Jenny's staying in a place they created out of love and with extras for comfort and enjoyment. It's a comfortable space in a very convenient location (quick walk to BART station) on a quiet street, and had everything we needed, and more, to make us feel right at home. We slept like logs in the extremely comfortable bed.
Location is desirable and my stay felt very private. Thank you Deborah Hines!! !
Thomas George was an awesome host, very easy to get a clasp of and very accommodating. It felt like we knew him. We would definitely stay there again and we absolutely recommend it.
John Brashier's place is a nice, cozy space. John Brashier is also helpful and communicates with you in you in advance of your trip so all is well. Overall, I loved the style, location, and convenience of John Brashier's studio.
We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental. Marty & David are great host. What we love about Marty’s place is, you have your own privacy & they also respect your privacy.
Edward Ramsey home is beautiful, spotless, and comfortable, and it’s located just a few blocks from beach. Elizabeth is a gracious host and is very helpful with directions and answering questions about the area.
We loved staying here! I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc.
Can walk around late at night without problem. Bathroom was awesome clean with all shower products provided. Big super plus bonus if your a dog lover .
I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's topographic point for our vacation. He gave us some tip where to eat and do some groceries and that helped also. We can't wait to come back next year!
We would highly recommend Ben and John Mullins B&B as a topographic point to stay. We loved our stay at Debra Dibble  & Ben’s place. They are consummate hosts and offered many helpful suggestion for exploring the area.
So only a short bus ride and tube to cardinal New York in about 25 minutes. Friendly host, nice and quiet neighborhood. The room is clean and comfortable.
Thanks again, Brent! I will never stay at a hotel for vacation again, this experience spoiled me & my family. Brent and Lois Davis introduced themselves to us on our 2nd day due to our late check-in, they were both so very friendly, they made us feel right at home.
We took full advantage of all the neighborhood had to offer, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping and more using reference material provided by the hosts. Highly recommend. This is a major value accommodation.
Heather is the epitome of “super host”! She then brought our daughter popcorn back and we chatted for a while; she is just the sweetest person ever! The cottage was absolutely perfect for our little family and it was nice that Heather had books and games for us to play with!
The room is well appointed and spacious, with lots of spare clean towels. The house is in a perfect quiet location very close to Gig Harbor. There’s big trees and it’s very tranquil.
Close to every reason you would be in Redondo Beach! Awesome place, very private room and bath~ entire home felt open, inviting and warm. Scott is easy going, friendly - warm and involved just enough!
Heated floors, a fireplace, fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta! I will definiltey be recommending this to anyone and everyone who plans to visit Chicago.
Inside was soooo clean. Beautiful Bathroom. Comfy bed.
We had a fantastic stay here for the two of us during a road trip through the southwest of the USA. What a wonderful place! Excellent location close to the beach, bike/running paths and restaurants.
We loved that they had breakfast items in the fridge for us - so sweet! You can definitely hear the kids running around upstairs, but that didn’t really bother us because they mentioned that they had kids and pets in the original post so we knew what we were getting ourselves into. We were early risers anyway.
! Paul’s bungalow is perfectly setup and ideally located close to the beach and restaurants. Cottage is cozy and comfortable with great attention to detail... bite , beverages and games provided.
It was myself, my husband and our 5 year old son. Michael & Capra’s airstream was such a unique experience. Our son absolutely loved it.
Deborah Hines was really good at answering our questions and giving us advice of places near by. Deborah Hines being in the house was the only concern, but it didn't even feel like he was in the house with us. The location is also perfect, 2 minutes away from stores like Food Lion, 3-5 minutes away from East Beach, 15-20 mins away from the center of VA Beach, and if you really want to go in the lake, the first bit of the lake is shallow and will only reach your knees.
Perks provided are the motorcycle , and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! And if you forget anything - a quick text to Tammy and Marc upstairs can solve that! By far the best place we have stayed over the years and we always come back and always will!
There was even a luxurious new mattress which was so comfortable. We will definitely stay again and highly recommend it.
We had so much fun at Paul’s place! We especially loved that he thought of anything we could need including coffee, bite , shampoo/body wash, blankets, etc. It made it such an easy and enjoyable stay in a beautiful town!
The bed is very comfy and we really appreciated the charging stations on either side. If you have a rental vehicle, parking can be a spot tricky on the streets, especially late at night. During the day we didn't have much trouble finding a place to park.
Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago
As for the Gregory Simons it was absolutely beautiful! I must say we really enjoyed our time and will def be back if we come to the Bay Area :)
With luxurious touches like a heated bathroom floor, a large shower, and beautiful succulent plants, I felt like we were staying in a top-rated hotel. The place is super easy to get in an out of without feeling obtrusive and us super comfortable with lots of great design and style. The fridge was stocked with awesome beer, the bed was incredibly comfy, and the bathroom has a heated floor...what the heck else do you need?
Short walk to beach and restaurants. Lovely neighborhood. Very relaxing and as nice as it could be!
This is my third stay at Igor's place, which has now become my NYC base! Igor is welcoming and the place is spotless, comfortable and well connected. I totally recommend it.
The lockbox was an excellent idea, I’ve never seen anything like that before. The lighting within the entire suite were just perfect. Felt like the perfect snug little home away from home.
While in town I also went to the Miranda Malone women’s watering place located 15 minutes away and Southern Kitchen which is down the street. A great last minute option.
The bed is very comfy and will be a great asset to you when you are done with all of your activities in Tacoma, especially since this is centrally located. The parking spot is also a big plus.
What can I say about heather... she is really a super host !!!!!!! You get in and feel.. wow that's it. You open the very good California wine which stand there  as an welcome offer, you sit down in the garden stretch your legs und are ...... yes at home or just arrived .
Walk into a beautiful,  peaceful private setting when you stay with Dennis Steward and James Walker. Was rly grateful that sandy and Kristine stayed up late and let us check in abt 10+ pm as we were stucked in a jam. They were so welcoming & offered us boiled water  as well.
Alfred’s restaurant across the street was an easy option for breakfast. Brian and Hillary's place is a great place stay if you're visiting the Tacoma area. Pictures accurately show the loft, and you won't be disappointed with the space.
Shopping is close by at Bay Street in Emeryville or 4th street in Berkeley (all of which Michael has laid out in a convenient welcome book) Easy to get into SF by the Bart at the Fruitvale station. The place itself was extremely spacious, stylish and clean. My parent's slept on the bed while I slept on the sofa bed (comfiest sofa bed I've ever slept on).
Tiana was a great host, she refreshed our towels, and help get the Wi-Fi up and going as I needed to do some work while I was there. She had beach toys, chairs and bikes to use which we took advantage of. I would definitely come back to this place, the location was great in Redondo Beach, and it was great for me and my family.
Jo's place is centrally located in Tacoma. Stores, museums, exhibit , pubs, local colleges, shops, restaurants, bus line and not one but two hospitals. There's even a park just a few steps away.
Super cozy bedding so we all slept well. The studio was well thought out and planned. It had all the amenities we could have needed including a hot water pot, coffee, creamer and sugar (especially liked the travel mugs for our walks in the Am).
This place is great! The bikes were really my favorite part, and I spent a day cruising up and down the coast on the antic bike route. I would highly recommend staying at Alejandrina Anderson cottage!
They don't have air conditioning, but the room temperature in the middle of summer was more than tolerable with the ceiling fan and open window. We had a great night's sleep and was impressed with the high quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the bathtub. For breakfast, Zeena laid out a wonderful meal complete with eggs, cinnamon toast, fresh fruit and coffee.
The garden is gorgeous - we loved picking fresh oranges and lemon ! It felt very private, with plenty of sunlight from the skylights, even when the shades were drawn. Ben & Jacqueline have print-outs with a guide for your stay that is super helpful, especially their neighborhood recommendations!
This was definitely the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Lots of amazing amenities, including snacks and bikes for guests. The place was very clean and comfortable, and takes minutes to bike or walk/run to the beach.
Jeremy Johnson is a kind, friendly host. The king-size bed is soft but I found it comfortable and slept well. The room is bright and well-lit and is bright in the morning as well, also very quiet.
Personal touch . Lots of beach toys available on site to use. Would stay again and recommend to friends.
She also had a lot of recommendations for dining and activities to do around the city. Thank you Angela for such an awesome stay in LA.
Thanks again! Lois Davis is a super host, and definitely one of the most kind and thoughtful people I've met through Airbnb. Her place is beautiful and homely, perfectly set to appreciate the wonderful experience of Virginia Beach.
The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. We are hoping to visit again soon and try out another one of their locations! Thank you Star & Austin, this air b n b was one of the highlights of our trip.
I highly recommend Igor’s place. Both Igor and May are most welcoming hosts and will do anything to make your stay a happy experience. We asked if it was OK to bring our little grandson to stay overnight for a couple of nights and they even made him feel very comfortable.
Tony and Attina were very responsive, warm, and friendly. Oh, and don't miss the view!
Amazing, very cosy, very comfy bed , stylish apartment. Close to local transport, short walk away. Great hosts.
The cottage is just lovely, the kind of place you want to wrap up at the end of the holiday and take back home with you! The residential area is also very pleasant. We were there during the Oakland marathon so the place was busy and buzzing, which only added to the atmosphere.
The location was convenient to exploring some really cool shops, bars, and restaurants nearby. My sister and I absolutely loved staying at Heather and JP's place. This was our first time booking an Airbnb and the bar is set really high for any future bookings anywhere else.
Very stylish, tidy, and roomy. There was no need to drive at all! Min was very responsive and very quick to answer my questions.
The guest house was very clean and broad . Will definitely be back and would recommend to solo or traveling couples!
The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Aaron’s place and convenient! Although, we had not met Aaron, he was always available when needed and was pretty clear with the instructions. Also, the apartment is near many places that you explore.
The balcony is perfect for reading in the fresh sunshine. Ocean Beach is the perfect place for that! Just steps from the beach, but close enough to any sights to see in San Francisco, I couldn't have asked for a better location.
Paul kept the place ace clean and fresh, we were really comfortable. We would recomend to stay here to anyone!
This has definitely become my home away from home. This place is adorable. Cozy 2 bedroom upstairs cottage... with kitchen and life room.
The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. Thank you Marianne for welcoming us to a little place in heaven .
A cozy, clean and comfortable spot in the historic North End! Nice coffee service! The refrigerator has eggs, English muffins, butter and jam.
It would be absolutely perfect for a romantic couple of days with a loved one...winter (drinking hot drinks, watching the storms over the water) or summer (enjoying the sunshine, walking on the beach). I would definitely return and would highly recommend!
are afterthoughts in many Airbnb’s. The apartment was very private and quiet. Most of all, we loved meeting Joan Litwin.
Chuck is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive. The house is extremely close to the airport - which is convenient, but I wondered if the noise would be problematic (I'm a light sleeper and pretty sensitive to noise) - nope, you can hear the occasional plane but it isn't bothersome at all, and we slept very well. Being a fan of mid-century modern art, design, and architecture, I thoroughly enjoyed the home and all the interesting furnishings Chuck has curated.
I loved the loft room with its lovely linens, comfy bed, sitting area and welcoming morning light. Brian Burns is truly a warm and thoughtful host and one who is happy to converse with his guests. And he does make the best cup of coffee!
Roy and Susan are great hosts and their space is very comfortable. there is great detail paid to the extra special touches like soft sheets, comfortable bed and lavish towels. The home was easy to find and the private entrance and parking space was wonderful.
Staying at Elizabeth’s place is an A+ experience. If you’re looking for a very relaxing space with a great host then this is the place for you! The large room (with balcony) was well lit with natural light and had a wonderful breeze flowing through it.
Danny runs a great place and is clearly an experienced host who has learned the needs and wants of his guest . The bedroom is comfortable and has nice touches like a floor fan to keep you cool and a phone charging station on the  nightstand. The living room is a cool place to relax over breakfast or to read a book in the afternoon.
Tyler has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience. He was quick to respond to any questions, of which I had very few since he anticipated most of my questions up front. No detail is too small for Tyler, even down to having chargers ready on both sides of the bed.
Would definitely consider staying here again the next time we’re in LA. Highly recommend!
This is a delightful bungalow with everything for a relaxing stay in one cozy package. We were so impressed by the well-organized space and the comfortable furnishings. The location is perfect.
2 blocks away. You can go to the Golden State Park walking. Beautiful topographic point to hang around and spend the day.
This place is perfect for two people looking for a small but comfortable place to stay. It has a very small kitchen a small living area, and a nice bed and a small bathroom. It’s extremely charming and has a lot of nice little tasteful touches.
So only a short bus ride and tube to central New York in about 25 minutes. The house is very well looked after and is clean and tidy but we did feel like we should be quiet and that made it a little eldritch . But they made us feel welcome and we would recommend.
I have been to many airb bnbs across the world, and this is the one I have felt most welcomed at. Marcia has though of everything in terms of hospitality: easy check in, snacks and wine at your leisure, and a beautiful, waterfront meticulous, cozy place. We had our own parking area and a welcome sign—My husband and I even joked, wondering if Marcia wanted some roommates!!!
She goes above and beyond to create an experience that is special for guests. From the twinkle light , to the thoughtfully placed snacks and refreshments, Angela’s spot cultivates an equally romantic, and relaxing environment. What a dainty !
I booked it right away without any issues. The home is located in a nice quiet residential area and there is plenty of street car parking for those renting a car. There some amazing places to eat close by and Marcos Blount also has a list of some amazing places to have breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Nala's place is absolutely perfect. Especially loved the bamboo shades to block out the street lamps. - comforts are spot on.
The front garden is magical and the cottage is so nicely decorated and appointed. It would have been nice to have a couch to stretch out on. I totally get it about no tv - there’s enough to do outside that you don’t need indoor entertainment.
The amenities provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush? not to worry! it's there!)!
Great for 1-2 people, the space is private, intimate, and relaxing. The location is perfect—close enough to San Francisco and surrounding cities but away from the chaos of the city. The location was our main hub as we traveled throughout CA during the week.
Would gladly stay again! Me and my boyfriend decided to visit Virginia Beach for few days in the peak season and Katherine’s place looked the best on this website according the price and the accessibility to the beach! When we arrived, it turned out to be so much better than we expected because we could just walk to the beach and to the local restaurants without using our car.
Double that in heavy traffic, but we did not mind because we loved this casita so much! This truly feels like slice of paradise. We could not have been happier with the adjustment !
Lots of pillows in varying levels of firmness...just the best sleep experience possible. There's a beautiful seating area by the window which looks out onto the garden, which is the most beautiful way to start your day, write in your journal and drink your morning coffee. There's lots of automatic lights that turn on so you're never in the dark (as you walk up the driveway in the evening, or even into the bathroom!)
Breakfast was delicious, and thoughtfully prepared. I would have liked to stay for a week. The house is easy to find right off the main road, but print the driving direction out, as well as the address.
Best of all was the attention to detail. The lone regret that we have is not being able to stay more days at her lovely home. Hopefully we can do that again in the future.
Their place is truly a respite. My daughter and I stayed at Wiseacre over Easter weekend and enjoyed every second of our stay. Chuck and Charlotte are most hospitable!
Crystal Romero shared some tips on best time of day to go which was helpful so I could collect some shells for my kids! The bed was cozy and the Alexa was helpful because I always fall asleep to music and I forgot my Bluetooth speaker. So glad Alexa could lullaby me to .
Along with fresh flowers, she left a basket of snacks (breakfast bars, cereal, oatmeal, chips and cookies), and a special dark chocolate orange treat. The kitchenette has a Kuereg coffee maker, k-cups and half and half in the mini fridge. There was a basket of toiletries in the bathroom (toothpaste, toothbrushes, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant and face cleanser).
Neva's in-law unit was the perfect location for a little weekend getaway at the end of a week of conferences in LA. Neva was also kind enough to let us use the patio to host two of our friends for a little. We'd definitely book again.
She and her family are such amazing people and made our stay a memorable one. I will definitely look to stay here again when I visit hopefully soon.
The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. We used our son's car and there is parking right in front of the house, on a low traffic road. The views from every window are breathtaking , it's very easy to fall in love with this place ,from the location to the wonderful accomodations .
We slept like rocks in that cozy bed, really enjoyed the large open shower, swang on the patio swing eating the snacks Bob and Sharann left for us, and chilled out with some Netflix on their large screen. We explored Mt. Rainier, Olympus and St. Helens and also spent a whole day in Seattle (even caught a Mariners game).
The whole building was super clean, comfortable, stylish, and safe. We would love to stay here again next time we’re in Chicago.
We drew, played guitar, watched shows, played pool, did our makeup in the mirror, took pictures, made coffee and tea, played games, listened to vinyls, etc we took advantage of all the topographic point had to offer us! It was my first time renting an Airbnb so I was nervous if I was gonna do something wrong or something was gonna mess up but it was a wonderful experience! I had a slumber party here with my friends for my birthday last week.
Our daughter and her boyfriend came up from LA to join us. The three sleeping areas each had very comfortable beds, good pillows, and plenty of blankets of varying weights. Each bathroom was large with large, fluffy towels, shampoo, conditioner, and bodywash.
We drove a few minutes, parked near the station, and caught a train that got us to the heart of the city in 30 minutes. Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago vicinity , with a bajiggety restaurants, parallel bars , shops, etc.
We loved our stay at Francis Jones's place and would highly recommend this rental. We felt like locals and loved it! Francis Jones is a delightful hostess, helpful and thoughtful.Thank you Francis Jones for this fantastic experience.
I hope to be back in the summer months! Chip's place is LOVELY! In some ways, I'd have to say that it's not as described because it was bigger and nice than I anticipated from the photos!
We love this place because it is absolutely gorgeous and stylish. My wife and I just got married and spent a few days in Chicago and we were glad to stay here for our mini-moon. Communication was also great from the start and it was clean.
! The motorcycle were so fun to have use of and we loved the local tip and recommendations provided by Elizabeth Jones. The room was very spacious and clean and the extra amenities like coffee was very appreciated.
I booked it right away without any issues. You have all your necessities for a short trip. You will be amazed at the beautiful craftsmanship and design of this home.
This all made our stay exceptionally easy and Tiana was wonderful to work with! Tiana's Beach Cottage is a prime example of why people are choosing Air B&B over traditional hotels. The location is unbeatable for Southern California; in the middle of everything you'll want to go see, but off the beaten path where you can really just take in the Beach sights and smells to ease your stress away.
Justin’s place is close to the one of the best restaurants in the world, as well as the “gourmet ghetto” of excellent and cheap food. The street was quiet, yet waking distance to amenities. A great getaway for me and my friend.
The cottage is a delightlful unit of measurement in a quiet residential neighborhood that is convenient to major street and restaurants. Heather cares about her guests and seems to continuously improve the experience. She will give you lots of information when you arrive.
We booked 1 week and had no issues, communication was excellent (George is very friendly and cheerful. Oakland - Myself and my boyfriend absolutely loved our stay here in Oakland, we didn't want to leave. Very spacious, peaceful and quiet.
Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. If you are not familiar with the area they have put together a great information manual to help out. The local grocery store down the road is great, good selection even though it is smaller than the large chains.
Shelton Gill’s place exceeded our expectation . Small oasis near a beautiful beach, and quaint town with lots to see and do. Shelton Gill was an awesome host, very easy to get a hold of and very accommodating.
The apartment is located within walking distance of mission district and with good bus links to the city centre and park areas. We really loved our stay at Tyler’s and would happily recommend the apartment to other visitors. Thank you so much for your amazing hospitality.
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. We really lucked out. We appreciate Tyler for giving this fun and memorable experience :)  what a gorgeous home.
It was a small chilly in Redondo the weekend that we were there so we didn't get a chance to take advantage of the bicycles/beach item that Paul provided but we appreciated having the option. Paul was very attentive and made sure everything went smoothly. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and would definitely book again with Paul in the future!
The neighborhood is super cute and most important, very safe. The Host Heather is so nice and her hospitality was AMAZING! The Cottage is located in front of Heather’s home so she is there if you need her for anything.
We used this Airbnb for our last night of vacation when we needed to get to the airport the next morning. We walked to the pier and ate dinner and watched the sunset. We were greeted by Miranda Malone and encouraged to get anything we needed from the kitchen or to use her fridge.
Great mattress on the bed. No microwave, but there is a fridge, very small (6” wide) sink & two burners for a basic meal. Better choice is to explore Rockridge/Temescal area eateries, many within 1/2 to a mile walk.
.I will high recommend this room. Elizabeth home was amazing ! It felt homelike , feels like home.
Overall, this place felt like home and was very cozy. It was very comfortable, relaxing and VERY clean!!! Nina was an excellent host and made us feel very welcome!
Linda and Mike are amazing. Linda is super easy to reach, responds promptly and is super kind. We met Mike too upon check out and enjoyed our conversation with both of them.
Park right next to the cottage, drop your bags and relax. Super clean, well directed with the perfect floor plan. Kitchen has everything you need and the bed was super comfy.
There are even hummingbird feeders right outside the window which make for the most cheerful position . We were only able to stay for a night but we would absolutely love to come back! Thank you for providing such a peaceful, restful space for a little pre-baby getaway!
The place was safe and secure, I didn't feel threatened on the streets or neighborhood. We had a great time staying in Dash Point at Tony and Attina's place. It was our first time in Tacoma.
This was the perfect place for us to stay in while in town for a family reunion. Esmie and her husband are perfect hosts and made us feel comfortable in their home. Although there were several other rented rooms downstairs, the house was quiet and our space felt private.
Amazing, very cosy, very comfy beds, stylish apartment. We came with our family and children and we all had a fabulous trip. The apartment is like home from home and Maggie was fast to answer our questions and help us.
Neva’s place was very sweet it was perfect and very convenient to many shops right across the street to Whole Foods any many Restaurants & cafes  Very nice sheets and a comfortable bed , lovely bathroom great outdoor space . Beautiful quaint place in a lovely part of Redondo Beach. The place is smaller than most hotels as described but very comfortable & was a great base to set up driving into LA (about a 40 minute drive).
Absolutely loved the upstairs bedroom. This home will not disappoint. Kitchen has a double oven as well as a microwave and a nice BBQ on the deck.
My wife and I are not bothered by a lack of toilet privacy but in case you are staying with another person, just take it into consideration! Overall, it was a wonderfully low-cost option and I would stay there again and recommend it to others.
All very clean and well kept. Our favorite part was the fenced backyard for my pup and the screened in porch. Perfect for relaxing with coffee in the morning (there's a microwave, mini fridge and coffee station with coffee and tea).
My wife and I recently spent two nights at Leslie's place in Berkeley, and enjoyed it a great deal. While the home is a bit hidden from the street, when we walked through the gate we were immediately taken with the sweet fragrances of the beautiful flowers and plants in the front yard. Although I wasn't sure from the home description, there are actually two small spaces to sit outside and enjoy the weather--on the front porch and on a bench in the front yard.
Close to the beach and many restaurants and shops but quiet. A lovely place to enjoy the beach life.
Zeena and her husband, Howie, have a beautiful home and were very gracious hosts. We communicated this via the message board and Zeena had no problem with the late check-in. Her directions to the house were very clear and it was easy to find in the dark.
We had a fantastic stay in Angela's bungalow..  She is such a fantastic host going above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. The bungalow itself is exactly as described in the Air BnB description as well as Angela creating an awesome setting each night. Top location in Redondo Beach close to everything!
For the past 20 years we have camped at First Landing State Park, of which our favorite facet is the Cape Henry bike trail which spans from 64th street, through first Landing all the way to Jade st.  Katherine’s place is about 200 feet from this trail so we were smack dab in the middle of all of our favorite things. The space was quiet, secluded and inviting. The bed and linens were over the top comfy and the bathroom and Kitchenette was stylish and updated.
Brent's place was spotless, very cozy and made us feel like home. I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. Also I have to say that the communication with him was above expectations since we went there a week after the hurricane Florence and I was so worried about the weather and the beach, but Brent was honest and so helpful answering to all my questions.
The place is great! You can walk to beach and there are restaurants and supermarket by ten minutes’ walk. The room is really clean and comfortable.
We felt safe walking around at night. Highly recommended!
This is an AMAZING Airbnb. Great guesthouse that was constructed well and has just the right amount of space. Great bed, great bathroom.
Angela’s place was wonderful. The space is well utilized and no space is wasted. Everything was clean and great amenities.
My boyfriend went to the gym downstairs, while I enjoyed the coziness of lounging around in the living room. The rooftop deck is worth checking out too. We went at night and the view was beautiful, especially with all the snow.
We absolutely loved our say in Arthur Paddick's place. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.
First of all, as a host, Justin couldn't be kinder or more helpful with suggestions and answers to any and all question . Contemporary, clean with a light bright feel. It's located on a beautiful street within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and coffee.
I love waking up to the water and mountain position ! Thanks, Richard Batton and Miranda Malone; your house was pretty much perfect!
The space was bright and airy while being a cozy nook all at the same time, the plethora of blankets and pillows was amazing. We were greeted with a personalized message at the front door which was a lovely touch, and Arnold Jackson was exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!
I can't be more thankful for chosing Brent's place for our vacation. The cottage is walking distance to the beach. Only downside is the cottage is above the garage but I'm an early riser so it didn't bother me at all.
Highly recommended if you are staying in the Redondo Beach area. Wow! I needed a place to spend the night before a morning flight out of LAX, and this room was amazing!
He has a lovely terrace filled with flowers, which was a perfect place to relax. The bed was very comfortable. Deborah Hines was proactive in communicating and very quick to reply to questions.
Paul's place was excellent; very stylish and clean. Check in was easy, and I loved being so close to the beach. We also really appreciated the entree to bikes!
Keeping this in mind we were respectful of the host and they of use - I did not hear or see anyone the whole time, making for a private stay. Great location,  close to beach, parks and restaurants, but also private and cozy. The inside space was lovely and very comfortable.
! Lori Stewart place is really special. We had 2 lovely days and nights here and enjoyed every moment.
I appreciated the special care Katherine took to ensure our comfortable stay. The walk to the beach is short and lets out in kind of a private area since the access is through a regular neighborhood. I had a great stay and would definitely come again
Hands down this Airbnb wins the cutest, coziest, comfiest award! The picturesque location is perfect! I could have stared out the kitchen nook window for hours.
Amy & Dennis’s cabin exceeded my expectations. They were very accommodating about checking us in when we arrived a little earlier than expected. I was at first nervous about the outdoor shower situation but it is incredibly private and the area is kept very clean.
The house was setup with great security features that helped us feel safe and also made check in easy! Would definitely book again for future visits!
It also has a balcony that shows a view of all of Tacoma. Jeni was a wonderful host that stopped by from time to time mainly just to restock and made sure trash was taken out properly for the weekly city trash runs. She was very polite and communicative to when contractors would come or when we needed tips for visiting areas around where we would stay.
We loved our time in Chicago and truly enjoyed our time at Joshua’s air bnb!! !
She accommodated our arrival and departure time cuz we came early and left late. My first time using air b&b and i am completely satisfied
Michael offers some ear plugs though, so unless you're a light sleeper you should be okay. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and I'd happily return. Thanks, Michael!
Ben and Jacqueline are amazing hosts, giving us tips on the area and San Fran, warned us about tolls, reservations needed for certain spots, and where the best people watching would be. Christina is a very gracious and thoughtful host. She was pretty responsive in her timing while we were messaging each other to figure out check-in logistics.
It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!
Star & Austin were great hosts and checked in with us several times throughout the visit to make sure we had everything we needed. We especially liked that they had a chalkboard with their restaurant recommendations in the room & we checked several of them out!
We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. The cottage is bright and cheery, and quite well-appointed, and the bedding is super comfortable! We were surprised by the high-quality air mattresses that allowed all of us to get a great night's sleep.
The kitchen is well stocked. The bed in the main bedroom is comfy. We had very good night sleep.
Thoroughly enjoyed this property! The location was perfect. Cute and quaint with many amenities including bikes and beach gear.
This place is like your home away from home. The guys very sweetly put out fruit, granola bars, yogurt, milk  and coffee. There even were freezer battalion in the freezer.
It is beautifully decorated and the host have thought of everything! I communicated with Rayford Kelly and she always got back to me right away. I will definitely try to stay here again.
Minutes from the beach with all the amenities that you could possibly need. Cozy cottage is just what you need for the days at the beach and piers. Anything you need is in walking distance including bars and restaurants.
Stay here if ever in the area. The Aloha house is simply perfect! Everything you need in a small but still cozy place!
The place is also incredibly convenient, a block away from the free train into downtown Tacoma. The other wonderful aspect is their awesome art. I would definitely stay here again.
We appreciated all of the special touches such as the welcome cupcakes,  the comfy bed, the washer and dryer, the outdoor sitting area, the fully stocked kitchen, the robes, the games, and the breakfast items that were provided for the week. I could go on and on. There was plenty of privacy, but the hosts were quick to welcome and were available if we needed anything at all.
We hope to come back soon! We were blown away by her cordial reception and the beautiful interior design of the guest house in which we stayed. Every last touch one could think of was addressed.
Danny runs a great place and is clearly an experienced host who has learned the needs and wants of his guests. I loved the personalized welcome and quick responses whenever we had a question, as well. I’d highly recommend this for folks who enjoy meeting other guests and who appreciate a centralized location inside the city.
The minor issues we had were quickly solved with a quick text. Barb goes above and beyond to make sure your needs are accommodated and you feel at home. The bedroom/bathroom were sparkling clean and had all the amenities you could ever imagine needing.
Stephanie is a lovely host. The full kitchen, comfy bed, off-street parking space, private laundry facilities and quiet neighborhood were all important plusses for us. We would highly recommend Stephanie's place to anyone visiting Tacoma.
Neva's place is great for the Redondo beach/Hermosa beach area. As long as you are ok walking for about 15 minutes or taking a short Uber the location is great and the guest house is definitely worth the value. I am relatively small so the place was all right for me but someone larger/taller may have some issue with the house as it is pretty compact.
Tiana was great at communicating by responding quickly & made sure to touch base throughout our stay to be sure we were comfortable & had everything we needed. Highly recommend!
Melissa's place is not fancy, but it was within cycling distance of the beach and restaurants, and she was friendly and helpful with dining suggestions. I saw Melissa at checkin but got up early and left. The house was quiet.
It was perfect for reading, reflecting, and journaling. This was truly an impeccable experience and Angela was so warm and gracious. At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it.
From the plush towels to the incredibly comfy beds, you will immediately feel welcome. The views are breathtaking. This is a must see and must stay home if you’re in the Tacoma area!
Which was a major plus for us. The neighborhood was great. Plenty of places to eat and bars to check out.
She has done a fantastic job making sure no detail is forgotten. This cozy, colorful, clean room is just the topographic point in which to relax. Every amenity has been thought of including extra pillows, TV, reading lamps for everyone, tissues for all, hair dryer, even things like toothbrushes and makeup remover!
Apartment is beautifully decorated and such a beautiful patio. We walked down there two mornings for breakfast. Would definitely stay here again if I’m in the area.
Good off street parking. We had more than enough space and the entire lot is very private with a beautiful backyard if you want to take a few moments to observe nature. Wish we had stayed longer, but if/when we return to the beachfront we'll definitely be keeping Jeremy Johnson's place in mind!
The queen bed was very comfortable, and the gas fireplace kept the cottage plenty warm. The french door in the living room open out on to a very nice deck, with a view across the yard to the water, and across to the mainland. The cottage is at the back of the yard, so be aware you don't have an expansive view of the sound from inside the cottage.
It offers a great location, an attentive host and  thoughtful amenities. We had a wonderful experience and great weather. Thank you Jennifer Merry and Karen.
We walked straight down avenue A to the walkway. We loved how clean the home was. The small touches in the kitchen.
Immaculate  Luxurious  Chic Haven  Dissolve into the bath Melt into the beds Nourish in the kitchen  Retreat to Jim and Maximo’s whole apartment  Whenever you need a get-away feel during your Andersonville visit  This is my second stay at this lovely space. A stellar listing, guaranteed to revive you during whatever activities you choose. A fabulous home base!
Chuck is a wealth of information, knowledge, traveled experiences, amazing people he was worked with/for, you will not regret staying here, I promise you. I'm a veteran Airbnb'er and my reviews are always honest to help that next future guest. For what it is worth, we will be back as we have formed a new friend at Wiseacre.
Heather's place was such a great find!! We came to WA to visit my sister. Our flight landed at 10 and after getting the rental and finding some food we showed up at 12.
He did a great job of making some suggestions, perfect for the kind of experience we were looking for! The space is great and very comfortable, and the proximity to the beach is unbeatable. The bikes are an amazing feature and made for a great day of hoping from boardwalk to boardwalk.
Immaculate  Luxurious  Chic Haven  Dissolve into the bath Melt into the beds Nourish in the kitchen  Retreat to Jim and Maximo’s whole apartment  Whenever you need a get-away feel during your Andersonville visit  This is my second stay at this lovely space. The hosts are responsive, helpful, welcoming and kind. So many things to do, steps from your door.
Sequoiah was a gem - present, helpful and she gave us some good local tips. A real plus for us was the outdoor shower in the greenhouse. What a delight to be in a private area, yet still feel part of nature.
I booked it right away without any issues. The home is located in a nice quiet residential area and there is plenty of street car parking for those renting a car. There some amazing places to eat close by and Nina also has a list of some amazing places to have breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Would stay here again in a heartbeat and wish I could call that small space home! Thanks so much for having us.
Very friendly folks. We also hit a new spot called Wooden City on Pacific (GOOD FOOD & friendly service) and HONEY COFFEE at Alma Mater for breakfast (they had super yum meat, veg & vegan options + pastries and really good coffee). Eating in Tacoma is good these days.
Bus #2 on 19th will take you directly to downtown Tacoma to visit museums and the Tacoma Dome. Titlow Park is about a 15 minute walk and features bird-watching, playground and views of Tacoma Narrows. Heather made sure we knew how to operate everything including the temperature and tv and had a great book of local eateries.
Check-in was a breeze, and Esmie an extremely kind-hearted guest. She knew exactly how to interact with us when we were tired upon arrival (politely gave us space after showing us in), and chatted with us more in the morning when we had lots of energy and wanted to talk. This is the most wonderful Airbnb experience we have ever had and will totally stay in the future!
We had intended to leave earlier,but slept in till checkout because we were so comfy. I met Joe in the morning and he was a charming, lovely person..I really appreciated him making us so welcome. The location is good for access to downtown.
Check in was easy. Access to the nearest public conveyance to the city is very close. Safe vicinity and very good value for money.
Angela was very thoughtful in the special touches she adds to her space like having beer and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived and making bikes available for us. It was a bonus to find out that she has this beautiful backyard space with an outdoor fireplace, comfy seating, cozy lights and lush gardens. Will absolutely stay here again.
I loved the modern finishes, and thought for value this loft is a real gem. I will stay again in the future, while on business in the Chicagoland area.
The place was fabulous! Some things you should know....  1) it only takes 4 1/2 minutes to walk to the beach! 2) the place is bigger than it seems in the picture (and really nicely kept)  3) her recommendation were spot on.
My son and I stayed here while in the area for a night. We loved our time in Tony and Attina's tiny house. They did an amazing job with the small space--very cute beach/island theme inside.
I can’t say enough good things here! Old Town is a great little topographic point in Tacoma with tons to do, and easy access to l-5. Coffee shops, restaurants and an excellent walking way along the bay just blocks away.
It’s quiet, convenient, and close the beach. The room was so spacious and comfortable! This is the gold standard of any place we stayed!
My husband and I had a lovely stay and really appreciated how well stocked the space was. As all the other reviews say, wow. The experience here is truly seamless-- Tyler is immensely thoughtful, super responsive and considerate.
Our experience in Heathers Cottage was awesome. The Cottage had everything and the Location was perfect. (next to Tacomas Community College) It was super confortable and there were many reachable super markets like Fred Meyer just 5 minutes away by walking.
I have one tip: the corner store a few blocks away is very expensive. I would suggest you pick things you might need for your stay at a grocery store you arrive.
 suite are neat and tidy, perfect place to stay with family. We will definitely stay again in our next visit to LA.
The rooms are super cute. The location is close enough to walk to the BART quickly. Everything was spotless and they have little labels on things so you know where to find anything you need.
Room had more space than expected and provided great comfort, warmth, and amenities. Wish I could’ve stayed longer. Thanks Neva for a nice place and easy stay!
It was so wonderful to have a chance to stay with Shantell Preusser again... and a great way to introduce my husband to Airbnb! Shantell Preusser is an amazing and thoughtful host. The accommodations are inviting and warm from the moment you enter her home.
I definitely recommend this cottage to anyone looking for a great stay in the area! Fantastic location, less than 5 minutes to beach. Very private.
We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. They both went out of their manner to help us and make us comfortable. We will be back next time we are in Chicago!
The bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a great shower as well as a big bath and the kitchen offered what we needed for our short stay. The location was very convenient and on a nice quiet street. The cottage itself was cute, cozy and comfortable.
Most everything you can imagine is within a 15 minute drive with some great options for lunch/dinner at an even shorter distance. The entire house is covered head to toe with a specific taste in art, it’s engaging. I just wish we had the time to ask about all the pieces.
In my three years of experience with Airbnb, staying at Angela’s topographic point is bar none the best experience I’ve ever had with an Airbnb listing. I now clearly know the reason why she has the ratings that she does, and why her place is booked so far out in advance. Every element, from the spa-like goodies to soy candles, was tastefully curated by function and design.
The post accurately reflects the place. Small but cozy. Best for solo traveler or at most two people World Health Organization travel light.
Comfy bed and quiet area for good night's sleep. We will definitely be back! Perfect location, shower was amazing, very spacious & the bed was heavenly.
Maggie's place is in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. Maggie is an amazing, friendly host; she responds quickly to our problem. We arrived in late evening and it was pleasantly surprising to see Gregory Simons and Beer in fridge!
But don't let that stop you from booking this gem! We played records, hung out in the hammock, we loved taking advantage of all you had to offer. We loved the interior decoration and style of the loft!
We also thought the locals were extremely friendly. It actually felt like staying at a friend's house (right down to the stocked keurig and cold beer in the fridge!). You can tell they love their home and we felt lucky to be able to stay there.
Basically it was like sharing his entire home. Scott’s place is Airbnb heaven! It is amazing!
And sparkling clean is not an enough word to describe the bedroom and bathroom. Zeena even provides the earplugs and eye pad for light sleepers. Thank you Airbnb for introducing this wonderful experience into my life and I'm becoming a big fan and advocate of Airbnb because of this stay.
Melia was an amazing host, she put fresh fruit for us, coffee, milk, snacks, and more. As for the Casita it was absolutely beautiful! The touches makes it super unique and quaint, it was extremely clean, and the view was amazing.
Chip's studio cottage is delightful. It's a very comfortable studio for two, with a spacious living area you can spread out in a little and enjoy your stay. The kitchen area works well; although there's no range, the two-burner hot place was sufficient for cooking our simple meals, and the electric kettle kept us in tea and coffee.
Though I never met Marc in person, he was quick and clear with communication. This apartment is ideally located. Close to many restaurants in the Mission and Castro.
When someone says "My house is your house" very rarely is it true, but it certainly was during our stay at Edward Ramsey. She took the time to drop us to whole foods which was just about 15 minutes away from the house by walk, not because we expected it, but it was a spur of the moment indication of what kind of host she would be. The bedroom and closet were spacious.
The hosts are friendly and helpful. Christian gave us brochures and tips on what to do as soon as we got there. Jackie baked some bread and it was delicious.
Susan’s home was our first Airbnb experience. Everything was so comfortable and at the end of a long day exploring we came home early just to rest in what was quite possibly one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever been in. Thanks Susan!
For this trip, I was lucky to be able to book my husband and his brother in at my fave place in Tacoma. My husband is a man of few words...and fewer superlatives. But below is all him:  Our stay at Susan’s place was fantastic.
No complaints! Crystal Romero was such a fantastic host. She was very informative and responsive when we had questions prior to the trip.
Paul’s a fantastic host and it shows. Great location and the 3 bikes he has for guests came in handy. Very short ride or walk to the beach (less than 2 blocks).
Then to San Francisco where we had lunch in China town and watched the Women's March on Market Street which was HUGE! It is fun and funky and authentically eclectic. The artistic touches and the environmental concern were a plus.
Everything about the location of this home was fantastic, both the water-front lot the home is on, and the proximity to the best that Norfolk has to offer. The wide, 2 story picture window view of Lake Whitehurst is alive with nature and tranquil with its beauty. His home is a real treat to discover with the unique architecture.
We loved this spot! It was super close to the beach, very clean, modern and stylish! Loved having the use of bikes and all of the little touches (coffee, water, pop, snacks).
We highly recommend Paul’s place. Paul and his family are simply amazing. We were met with incredible hospitality, a beautiful space, a super friendly porch, and a fantastic location.
The cottage was so cozy, clean, and decorated lovely. Any question we had, they answered right away and they were so helpful with all their suggestion for things to do. There is an amazing library of book at hand.
We mainly used the house as a base to explore San Francisco, travelling mainly by shared Lyft drive ( a nice way to meet the friendly people of the Bay Area!) We did have a full Oakland day as well, both in the immediate neighbourhood of the house as well as surrounding neighbourhoods, and another morning where we went to the awesome Grand Lake Farmer's Market, a short walk from the house. Had I had more time, I would spend more time exploring Oakland, where there is lots to do, and nicer weather than SF!
Great location. Appreciated the parking space. Comfy bed and quiet area for good night's sleep.
You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cunning . Thank you ! !
We had a great stay from first arriving thru to departing. Unfortunately due to delayed luggage we lost some time and didn't get to explore as much as planned. Ken was very friendly and offered if we needed any additional supplies due to the lost luggage.
Very clean and comfortable topographic point . Arnold Jackson was very friendly and nice to talk to. Very accommodating and responds quickly.
Dorothy Moser and Mike are amazing. Dorothy Moser is super easy to reach, responds promptly and is super kind. We met Mike too upon check out and enjoyed our conversation with both of them.
We loved our stay at Erica's place and would highly recommend this rental. There is everything you need from delicious coffee, the best tea selection, confortable mattress and a poetic je ne sais quoi to the whole experience. Once we got to know the area, we loved grocery shopping at the Berkeley Bowl market and getting our breakfast there in the morning.
I booked it right away without any issues. Janet Luckman reached out to me right after and asked if we had any special requests and said she wanted to make our stay as comfortable as possible which is such a nice gesture. She gave us the information needed to get to the house and how to enter without any issues.
2 blocks from the beach :) I've stayed in many places and Paul's place is so well thought out and equipped. This place offers anything you might possibly need when traveling and many amenities.
She put a lot of thought into finding quality eateries.. everything from coffee shops and greasy spoons, to seafood and Mexican. You will sleep well. The kitchenette is adorable.. and I loved the window seat, which was a perfect reading nook.
Most of all, you could have almost everything u need to go beach and explore villages such as surfing board, cart to carry stuffs and bikes. I bet u won’t regret.
When we arrived we were allready briefed on how to check in and we also recieved some guidelines. Once inside we were amazed on how clean the whole house (including the private bedroom and bathroom) is! Everything you could possibly need was available and more!
The house is in a quite vicinity . A couple of neighborhood parks are close by. I can not say enough good things about Angela and the house.
Angela's topographic point is perfect for 1-2. Would highly recommend her place.
She offered us bikes to browse the neighborhood  The place is amazing and would fit two ppl perfectly. Bathroom is so elegant  There is kitchen with coffee maker and many coffee options.. There's a backyard with lovely sit of chair and fireplace..
Tyler’s room was about a 20 minute flat walk to the 24th street mission BART station which was very convenient. Communication was great, Tyler gave a ton of amazing recommendations. Location is also a plus, it’s in a great area of SF that has a great vibe - lots of places to eat, drink and shop.
Be aware that there are stairs (read pack light) and the bars might be a little loud on the weekend (read if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs) but we enjoyed everything about our stay:  chefs kitchen, spa-like bathroom, and comfortable furniture. Denise’s place was beyond expectation. If you think the place is great from the pictures, you’ll be pleasantly surprised and pleased when you arrive!
Danny runs a great place and is clearly an experienced host who has learned the needs and wants of his guests. We met some nice people there and enjoyed our conversation. He also stocks the kitchen with some breakfast items like breads, English muffins, pastries and cereals, not to mention plenty of coffee.
Lois Davis place was an easy walk to my venue on the beach. Staying at Lois Davis was the perfect choice for me.
You will enjoy the ambiance of the candles and lights. I cannot believe how special and wonderful Angela’s space was! Truly the best airbnb I have ever stayed in.
The room was impeccably clean, spacious, quiet, and VERY comfortable, with beautiful linen and decor. !
The bungalow is wonderfully located a few blocks from the beach and close to shops, restaurants, and grocery store . It was very convenient for me to get around the south bay. It is about a fast 10-15 minute drive to LAX, but beware of internal airport congestion once inside the airport.
Words can not express how nice Betty Maust and Jeremy Johnson were. The host are wonderful! Friendly, quick to respond.
I hope I will have the oportunity to come back again with more time. Coffee was excellent and we had a fun time bike riding all day under the sun. I would definitely recommend this place and I would absolutely return.
Situated close to popular attractions such as the Museum of Glass, this home was thoughtfully furnished and clean. If you happened to forget something before arriving, the house likely has a clean spare of what you need (toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc). In addition, there were some communal food items available, which helped since I forgot to bring granola bars for breakfast; a quick PB&J did the trick before walking the town!
~Lynne and Patrick Angela is an amazing host! Her place is absolutely adorable and very comfortable.
Me and my Husband are going to be staying there in a couple of weeks to Celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. We had a fantastic stay at Richard Batton! The room and en suite were clean and well decorated.
This is a great little place that is truly 1 block walk to a great CA beach. Tiana provides everything needed for the beach including a wagon to carry it all. The cottage is comfortable and has its own private entrance, parking space and patio.
The place is as goo as advertised. Paul is a great host and went above the beyond. The location here is as good as it gets, literally two blocks from the beach and walking distance to a pier.
A huge plus was the bed! It is so comfortable we slept all the muscle aches from sight seeing off every night. This is definitely a great place to stay and is very affordable!
There is an entry room with couch, then walk through the main bedroom/living area to get to the dining room/kitchen, and at the end of the kitchen is the bathroom. Some really great food choice around here, it was easy to feed 4 of us either out or in the apartment. Most importantly, this is by far the CLEANEST airbnb I have ever stayed at.
It's very close to Redondo and Hermosa beach - we walked to both beaches the next morning. Neva is a great host and she welcomed us warmly!
The kids playground across the street and dinning/shopping area within a couple minute drive. We enjoyed the easy check in/check out and the way the place is set up. Brent is very responsive and available to provide any help and answer any questions.
Her small touches are great. This topographic point was perfect for our one night stay! It was a short walk to the pier and Neva was awesome!
The area around the location has many restaurants and is safe. The historic Streetcar (Line F) to Fishermans Wharf is also in walking distance from brendas location. All in all I had a perfect stay in Brendas AirBnB room, I can recommend her location highly.
Ewa met us outside when we arrived to show us where to park and gave us a short tour of the suite . Very comfortable, stylish, clean apartment. Bed is particularly cozy and we loved reclining in the leather chairs.
We drew, played guitar, watched shows, played pool, did our makeup in the mirror, took pictures, made coffee and tea, played games, listened to vinyls, etc we took advantage of all the place had to offer us! It was my first time renting an Airbnb so I was nervous if I was gonna do something wrong or something was gonna mess up but it was a wonderful experience! I had a slumber party here with my friends for my birthday last week.
The host and hostess were very kind and amenable. There were dishes left out specifically for my use and space in the refrigerator downstairs set aside for me as well. It was quiet and peaceful, just right to get some last minute studying done.
We had fun and laughed a lot with Pamela Drew especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . Sorry for that Pamela Drew . Should we come to visit Chicago again sometime , we definitely will stay again in his place.
The loft bed was comfortable but because it's close to the ceiling, you have to be cautious to not hit your head. Also, it does get a little bit warmer when you're sleeping that high up so I had to turn up the AC during the night. All-in-all, we really enjoyed our stay.
Susan is very friendly and available if needed but is respectful of our privacy. We would not hesitate to return to the Elmwood cottage!
Highly recommended! Elizabeth is a wonderful host. Her beautiful home has everything you need.
Neva's place is awesome! If I come visit LA again soon, I'd stay there again. It's so clean and quiet.
The bed is extremely cozy and comfortable. We were headed to San Diego for the next part of our trip and needed a quick laundry fix. Marianne is by far the best Airbnb host.
Linda's place is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museums. Bed and pillows were comfy; the private bathroom had a bathtub with shower. Wifi was fast.
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. We really lucked out. We appreciate Edward Ramsey for giving this fun and memorable experience :)  what a gorgeous home.
Incredible design, and extremely comfortable. The electric fireplace was so cute and made it very cozy :) Thank you Peg and Jeff!! !
Friendly. Pretty much everything you could dream of for a tiny house! This was our first tiny house stay and it blew us away.
Melia's casita is a wonderful topographic point to stay when in the Bay Area! I would highly recommend this great topographic point for any visitors, and I hope to be able to stay there again in the near future!
We really liked the "invisible" Dyson fan in the room! The house is more welcoming & spacious than in the photos.
Susan preemptively asked about any special likes or dislikes my parent and then went above and beyond to provide great touches like pastries from a wonderful local bakery, coffee, fruit, etc. This will be their go-to place to stay whenever they come back out to visit.
Parking is not an issue as Angela has her own parking space which we've used and also the st had a free parking spaces..  We definitely gonna recommend our friends to choose such a lovely place if they ever visited LA.. The perfekt Airbnb Experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We felt very comfortable with Angela. Everything was lovingly and thoughtfully addressed.
My parents were visiting from out of town for their first trip to the Seattle/Tacoma area and to meet my fiance for the first time. This was also their first stay in an Airbnb, which they were a little hesitant about. But after checking-in and spending one night at Susan's place, they were hooked for life!
Thank you Jerry and Julie for being such amazing hosts! And the beds and pillows were so comfortable! Will be back.
Morning sunrise and evening sunset are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area. The view spans past the wonderfully creativity of the land into the clear gorgeous Whitehurst Lake with birds bathing all day long and paddle fisherman enjoying their mornings on the weekends. Kayaking is also something to consider if you have time!
Ron and Laurie are excellent hosts, and their historic home is at the heart of everything! The charming back studio apartment opens to a lovely private  garden from a separate side entrance. I enjoyed sunbathing and decompressing there.
The living room/bedroom has all the necessary comforts, with a sofa and ample room for clothing and other travel goods. We made good use of the stove and other kitchen amenities. The bathroom is clean and bright with a strong, rejuvenating shower.
The suite is massive, modern, well-outfitted and an excellent value. ), the private deck and the gorgeous views of Mount Sutro. Despite the tucked away location in the relatively sleepy Inner Sunset, it's just two blocks from the Muni, which will take you to downtown, the Embarcadero, etc.
As an individual guest, I found this space to be absolutely perfect. Tony and Attina have  laid out the minimal space in such a way that all needs were met -- beyond what I had expected. And sitting out on their deck on a cool spring evening was just the "bee's knee ".
The entire cottage is wood paneled and has fun little touches like a funky port window in the bathroom and a long skinny window to see out to the BBQ area. Book now! Unless we've beat you to it for a repeat visit!
Mike and Linda were great hosts. The room was perfect temperature and comfortable. I loved being able to have a cup of coffee in my room and takin my time getting up.
It is pretty close to the airport, there is a great breakfast diner close by, the room was much larger than I expected, I loved the King size bed, it was very clean and check in was very convenient and easy. This was a super easy and nice place to stay for our evenning before leaving from LAX the next day. Lori Stewart responded quickly and the king bedroom/bathroom were comfortable and just as described.
There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but John Mullins provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy.
The home itself has lots of charm and is nicely decorated throughout. While the small TV is viewable only from the formal dining table, it worked fine for us when watching a bit of television in the evening. The kitchen is spacious and fully equipped with plenty of counter space and everything needed to prepare a few meals.
It remained nice and warm inside even as it snowed. We had to (Hidden by Airbnb) how to work the little stove heater (we didn’t realize the pan/pot needed to be on the surface before it would work) but hey! We figured it out and we were stoked that it ended up working faster than my stovetop at home!
They had coffee, oatmeal and small snacks to enjoy. Each June I travel from California to Tacoma to oversee a program at the University of Puget Sound. My stay is for three weeks.
Chuck is a great guy - very friendly and interesting, but is never intrusive. And the home and grounds are spacious enough that we were never in each other's way. He works quietly in his office most of the time, but is readily available for a chat, advice, or a recommendation for food or something to do.
The picturesque location is perfect! Teresa Knight was more than accommodating even before we arrived. If you’re on the fence about booking this topographic point , just book it!
The kitchen is well stocked wit tea, coffee, sugar, oil, sauces. U are located about half an hour from the city and transportation right beside u. We enjoyed our stay wit Tyler and would recommend to anyone.
What more could you ask for. Our experience at Crystal Romero's is going to be hard for any other AirBNB host to beat! Thanks a million to Crystal Romero and Merv for a wonderful experience!
I have to mention the good quality of the bed;)! We stayed just one night but won't hesitate for the next time. We recommend...
There's clean towels, a kitchenette (no stove), tea, coffee and even extra toiletries to use if you need. I loved the sparkling water in the fridge as well as the robe and slippers to use for the bath. Waking up in the morning or ending my day with a run/walk around the lake (just steps away) was the best.
There is even an outdoor shower and all kind of beach items for guest to use. Don’t miss booking this gem.
A lovely part of Berkeley, with beautiful garden all around and the street is incredibly quiet so you can get a good night's rest. Highly recommended.
We felt extremely comfortable, the room is modern and chic, everything you could wish for, even Aveda Shampoo...perfect down to the very last detail. We'd love to come back!
We loved the location away from the hustle and bustle of Tacoma, but still close enough to go into town for the day. The hosts were very quick to reply when we needed help getting the access code to unlock the door. I would absolutely stay here again if we ever went back to Tacoma.
Overall, we had a fantastic stay and would definitely book again with Paul in the future! This place is spectacular, more spacious than the photos convey and beautifully updated. We used the cruiser bikes daily for rides to the Pier for brunch or Hermosa for fresh oysters.
The space was decorated really nice, everything was very comfortable including the beds & lounge area plus there was thoughtful amenities like a mini fridge, coffee maker & washer/dryer for guest to use. I’d highly recommend their place if you’re in the area!
The house was ADORABLE and so so comfortable. We'll definitely try to book the Little House again following time we're going up to the Bay Area. Thanks,  Joseph Lewis!
Loved the views, truly beautiful from every room and either deck. Richard Batton and Erik Dickson were extremely accommodating and wonderful to work with. Great selection of games to play.
Nothing was too much trouble for him. We really can’t thank him enough.
Overall one of the best Airbnb experience I have to date and will book again when I come back to Chicago. Nice private room, with a firm/squeaky bed. (Just like the description!)
Every amenity listed is indeed there, but words in descriptions don't really do the place justice. Chuck immediately makes you feel at home, listens, and does everything he can to help you get what you're looking for in an Air B and B experience. His suggestions for things to do when we were out exploring were all spot on and nothing you'd find in any guide book or brochure.
The bedrooms have plenty of room, the bathrooms are broad and the living room is cozy with a warm fireplace. The kitchen is a winner too. We love preparing and cooking our own meals while on vacation instead of dining out, so having a kitchen that’s spacious and fully equipped is a must for our family.
What nostalgia on the games! The place was safe and secure, I didn't feel threatened on the streets or neighborhood. The driveway is a tiny bit cramped if you drive a behemoth, so be careful but the how-to guide explains this too ;-)  If you want to learn more, just stay!
you basically spend economy price for a presidential suite. I will stay again over and over and over and over in the future :) thank you so much.
A true godsend when you are many miles from home! Chuck made us feel like we were at our home away from home!! We will definitely be staying here again!
Elizabeth’s home is just two blocks off the beach and an easy walk to the Redondo Pier area. She has such a beautiful home, and the room with the ensuite bathroom was about as big as my old apartment, with a gorgeous view. Being a single woman, I wanted some place safe and I found it at Elizabeth's.
There's lots of automatic light that turn on so you're never in the dark (as you walk up the driveway in the evening, or even into the bathroom!) And lots of locks and safety measures, so if you're staying alone as I was, you feel secure.
Couldn’t tell that from inside the house, central air kept us nice and cool. My two youngest and I had the benches in the great room for our bed . We found them very comfortable.
The bedroom was among four other bedrooms on the second floor occupied by other air-bnb travelers (which I didn’t realize before) but we never heard any of the others and we felt completely comfortable. John Mullins was an absolutely wonderful host for our little staycation. The home is situated in a perfect location with 100% walkability to my favorite parts of SF, and has so much personality and charm.
Angela's place somehow embodied stylish & at home all in one. Everything is white, which I loved because that makes it easy to tell how clean it is (no worries- her place was immaculately clean). It was a 20 min drive to all the "touristy" things we wanted to do & a 5 min walk to the nearest bus stop.
It’s close enough to walk to shop , restaurants and the beach. Neva was a perfect host and her little puppy Logan was the best! We will be back for sure!
The house is in a quite neighborhood. We will definitely be back.
We wanted quiet and privacy, and this suits the bill perfectly. We hardly heard a sound our entire stay -- I think we heard one car drive by on the road. We didn't run into Chip while we were there, but he let us know he was available and he responded immediately to any messages.
If you happened to forget something before arriving, the house likely has a clean spare of what you need (toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc). The place: This Airbnb is fantastic. It was equipped with the best amenities, the view from the kitchen showed a good view of Downtown Tacoma.
She also had a lot of recommendation for dining and activities to do around the city. Thank you Michael Krieg for such an awesome stay in LA.
My wife and I spent 4 days at Tyler’s Airbnb and enjoyed every minute of it. Tyler’s Airbnb is conveniently located in the west side of the city and is just a couple blocks from the beach where we got to see some amazing sunsets. There’s tons of places to eat and grab coffee, just a few blocks from the house.
My family and I had a wonderful experience at The Carriage house. A nice accommodation was the outdoor shower when coming from the beach. Having the peaceful outdoor area also added to a great experience!
Any question we had, they answered right away and they were so helpful with all their suggestions for things to do. And a basket filled with ideas and suggestions for restaurants and places to go, each with hand written note . I highly recommend staying here.
Joseph Lewis bed and quiet area for good night's sleep. Easy check in and great communication. Only wish we had longer and definitely hope to be back in the future.
This location is so very convenient, parking is steps away, private, room and amenities are all there for any traveler tourist or business. The cherry on top is Paul who provides all the information you'll ever need for the surrounding area. I'm still full from all the wonderful restaurant he recommended.
Noe Valley is the best area when you dont want the hustle and bustle from Fishermens Warff. They have good tips for the area too. Nice and comfy bed!
I had an outstanding stay at Elizabeth's place. Although we only stayed for a night on our way back, I cannot recommend Elizabeth's place enough. Great location, and the room is just wow.
Every recommendation was spot on and she was beyond hospitable. The back patio was so perfect. We built a fire the second night after adventuring all day and it was the perfect unwind area.
Although every other aspect of this lovely home made up for it! The area was incredibly quiet - but still close to the places I wanted to get to. I loved the morning walk to the BART station.
We had a wonderful stay here for the two of us during a road trip through the southwest of the USA. Place was comfortable for our family of 4. Super cozy bedding so we all slept well.
I highly recommend to stay her house! I wanna stay again
Blown away by all expectations. Everything was top notch quality. Looking forward to staying again soon.
I liken it to house-sitting for your girlfriend, who has magazine-worthy taste in antique collecting and design! Jennifer Merry was a splendid host, and did everything to make our stay so easy and comfortable. We appreciated the added kindness of coffee and snacks along with all the kitchen equipment we could want.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Pamela Drew loft is gorgeous and very spacious. Filled with art & comfy furniture.
She is very friendly with a warm personality and responsive to any question we may have had. It was extremely clean and comfortable. She had recently purchased a new Casper mattress.
The kitchen is basic and rustic, not suitable for extensive cooking, but it had everything I needed. bit is a great host and his dog Olive is the sweetest! It's so nice being so close to the water.
I would highly recommend staying at Nina's Jeremy Johnson, you will not be disappointed. Nina and her husband were great hosts. The location is about a half hour from the beach and located in a quaint neighborhood.
We stayed with our two kids this time, but we'll be back again for a longer trip to enjoy this fun property close to the beach and some great restaurants (try Mama D's, especially if you have kids. Had the best time! Place is so cute and well kept.
You are only a 5-7 minute walk to the L.  Bus transport is easily accessible. As well, the neighborhood is very cool. It is close to many other fun areas of west Chicago.
They have 2 sweet pooches who are out on the shared patio at times. There is a privacy curtain for the sliding door/window entrance so don't worry about any exposure. Overall, nice folks, nice topographic point , nice area, nice time.
The subway line into Manhattan is just a 15 minute walk away. Great place to stay!
We stayed here for just under two weeks and loved it! While we were just behind the main house there was never any noise or disturbance and we had tons of privacy. We only met one of the hosts in person briefly, but all the communication through messages was friendly, prompt, and informative.
Heather checked up on my mother and I a few times during the week which really warmed our hearts to see she cared how we were doing. Heather also knew we were there visiting my new baby nephew, and my mother’s first grandchild, and she gave us a gift for him too, which was above and beyond anything she had to do. Things we loved about the Cozzy Cottage,  the beds are sooo comfy, literally every morning when my mother and I woke up all we kept saying was what a great night sleep we got.
At Wiseacre, you can expect a superb host, warm and relaxing surroundings that will make you smile, and a stay that you will remember in your heart. Every amenity listed is indeed there, but words in descriptions don't really do the topographic point justice. You have to see for yourself.
The location is great for walks and getting to the beach. Marcos Blount shared some tips on best time of day to go which was helpful so I could collect some shell for my kids! The bite cart was super helpful and made the place feel more homey!
! Wonderful hosts and topographical point . Our secret hideaway.
It's conveniently located to everything and super charming. Tiana was very communicative and helpful with everything we needed. We tried to book again before leaving, but she was all booked up during our next visit.
Francis Jones guest house is wonderful! The location can not be beaten, a very short walk to the beach and some lovely restaurants. We were only there one full day so we didn’t get a chance to use the bikes provided, which was a shame, the route Erik Dickson recommended sounded wonderful and had we been in Redondo Beach longer we would have loved to venture a bit further.
The photograph of this place do not do justice to how lovely, warm and full of thoughtful touches it is. And ofcourse, how can I not mention about the cutest, warmest cat I've ever met and that's Sir Dumpling! He is so adorable and I had a lovely time playing with him even though I am not an animal lover and a little paranoid around pets.
Highly recommend, as long as you are able to negotiate a long flight of stairs. Room was really clean and they helped us carried our baggage up the stairs! Really appreciate it after a 16 hours flight and stuck 2 hours in the customs.
10/10! Added bonus was the $12 uber (cheap!) to the Tacoma Dome for our concert.
Betty Maust place provides not only a reasonably priced stay, but in addition, a lovely patio, a place to store & heat food, a fireplace (my personal favorite! ), coffee, & snacks. Another thing that puts them a cut above other places, is they check- inch to see if you need anything and go out of their way to help, if they are able.
Tiana's place is a beautiful beach cottage just minutes from Redondo beach. Numerous personal touch make staying here a very relaxing and enjoyable time. The cottage is immaculate and the amenities such as the beach cruiser and beach chairs simply add to entire experience.
Oh on behalf, I couldn’t live without their outdoor hot bathtub and mediated room! We loved looking at all the artwork and woodwork in the house, and we were more than comfortable. It honestly felt like staying with friends as Steven and Sara were both very friendly and inviting, and we had a great time conversing with them.
We slept like babies. I loved everything about my stay. David responds fast, the bart is close by, there are great restaurants and brunch spots near by that I will miss dearly and they provide everything you might think of that makes for a great/easy stay.
Thanks, Alejandrina Anderson! !
Robert Turpen was a very great host! She puts great attention into her little home away from home and we appreciated it! Thank you for a great stay, we hope to be back!
This was our second visit to Ben and  Michael's topographic point . Both Ben and Michael are great host . The B&B is completely self contained and has everything needed for a comfortable stay.
Good location, easy walk to beach and eating places. With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. We biked along the esplanade all the manner to Manhattan beach!

Well today is the last day of my 28 day stay at Wiseacre. I came here to Norfolk Virginia to hang out with my 4 grandchildren ages 13, 10, 6, and 5. I also worked as usual on during the days since they are in school all day long.
Melia's place was outstanding! Such as breakfast options, cooking supplies, and a french press for coffee lovers! The bed was comfortable with lots of pillows and extra blankets!
She rearranged her agenda to be home for our noon arrival. I highly recommend Elizabeth as a host.
The space is absolutely gorgeous, impeccably designed, feels like home. If you’re traveling solo or as a couple, this a great topographical point to stay.
First time Airbnb'er here..  Neva's place was exactly what i was looking for.. The space was small as indicated, but that's more than okay, because we were in Los Angeles - no need to hang out in the room for long! Location was great as well, just a skip away from the beach, and right next to the highway for easy traveling access.
Had an incredible stay at Kelly's place. The suite is massive, modern, well-outfitted and an excellent value. We were particularly impressed by the luxurious bathroom (probably the nicest of any AirBnb I've stayed in!
Our time at Lois Davis's was an experience that we weren't expecting, but are so blessed to have had. Lois Davis is one of the sweetest human beings I have ever met. It is very apparent that it is important to her that her guests feel welcome, cared for, and truly at "home away from home".
We did Uber Pool a couple of times and it cost anywhere between $5-$7 one way to get downtown. We were in the city to see Lori Stewart, but also went to the Art Institute Chicago and ate dinner at the Blue Door. Their place was easy to travel to between all those places.
This was a nice little place for a one night stay in the city. The topographic point is right next to a beautiful park that we walked to in the afternoon it was just really nice. Thanks for a lovely stay Angela!
I typically stay in the same hotel each time I visit the East Bay for work. The house is so modern, spotless, and there was fruit, tea, chocolate and a bottle of wine waiting for me   The one aspect that I thought I wouldn't adjust to was not having a television. However, this ended up being something I loved.
This place is wonderful! I’m taking some ideas home with me to spruce up my interior decoration ! The location at first I thought was in a gritty neighborhood but it turned out nice, there’s a grocery store store store just a block away too which is nice.
It's a very quick down to the beach and even if you forgot your beach stuff he's got you covered with everything you need to have a fun beach adventure. There's a great Italian restaurant around the corner from him if you want some grub and then come back and relax in the nicely decorated place. We look forward to the following opportunity we have to stay with Dorothy Moser
We would definitely stay here again! She had it preset when we got there and we fell in love with the station.
The room is very spacious, bed is incredibly comfy, bathroom is spotless, and there is parking on premises. This topographic point was really cute and well-prepared. The room was adorable and had a really comfortable bed with fresh towels and linens.
Heather gave us a very lovely welcome and she gave us many informations about things to do in Tacoma. I would come back here anytime if i stay in Tacoma again! large Recommendation!
This place is worth the money! I think you never regret if you will chose Melisa's house. The bed is my ideal (7 pillows ) and bathroom is very pretty, Melisa really ready for everything, if you forgot towels, shampoo, soap, sunscreen, she can give all it for you; location little far to beach, but you can take bike and less than 10 minutes you will be on the beach; never try to buy something in beach cafe, it's too expensive.
We relaxed on the comfortable bench, listened to the bird and smelled the wonderful orange flower. For someone from Florida, this is a big plus. The house is in a quite neighborhood.
Such a cozy home! bed and pillows were comfortable. When we were there, the temp outside was like 31 degrees.
Heaven. Loved staying at Nevas and will definitely be back. Traveling alone I wanted something nice but low-cost .
The room has a private mini fridge and Kuerig. The bus stop is within a short walking distance and took me straight to downtown Tacoma in 30 minutes. The host and hostess were very kind and amenable.
I would highly recommend her place for short or long term corset . Really easy walking distance to all that Redondo Beach has. Extremely clean and neat; VERY comfortable bed.
It is ideal for the single traveler and couples. It would also work well for two good friend traveling together who don’t mind sharing a queen bed and the close-ish- but comfortable- quarters. Marc and Noom were wonderful hosts.
Chris goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The book with all the advice and transportation tips were so helpful, it made eating and getting around much easy !! Also the stocked electric refrigerator with juices, expensive granola, and toiletries provided was very much appreciated.
He is so adorable and I had a lovely time playing with him even though I am not an animal lover and a little paranoid around pets. To sum it up,  the place felt like home and we would love to come and stay here whenever we are back at Chicago :)
Great views of Oakland docks and a different position of San Francisco Bay including travelling under the Bay Bridge. You can catch any train into San Francisco. I would recommend anyone looking for a warm and friendly household must stay at Christain and Jackie’s.
As someone visiting LA for a couple days, I wanted to be close to the beach and this place definitely had it. There was a little bit of maintenance trouble at the beginning of my stay (I think there was a toilet leak) so I had some unexpected visitors for about an hour while they repaired the toilet but honestly I think these things happen and everyone was very respectful. That said, just know that this is a VERY small space.
Check-in and check-out were super easy. I highly recommend Justin's place if you need a nice, clean place to stay in the East Bay Area and do not require a kitchen!
There were seven of us in total who stayed there for six nights. tons of beautiful space to entertain us. Both inside and out.
The kitchen was stocked with goodies for us for breakfast (and some candies for treats)—there must have been at least $40 worth of groceries in there for us to use. Very generous, thank you!! Excellent location and just perfect for a weekend get-away visiting friends.
The place was extremely neat, with fresh towels and linen provided, along with all the bathroom essentials. Tyler was extremely responsive to my questions and requests, and it was very easy to communicate. We had a wonderful experience at Tyler's place and I would recommend it to other travellers to SF.
Scotts place is amazing!!!!! It was in the perfect location for the wedding we had. During our time off, we enjoyed the bikes he provided and we were able to bike to a local coffee shop, nail salon, the beach, all around town!
Dolores park is dramatic . Steps away. Also steps away was Linea Coffee.
I arrived rather late in the evening (around 9:30ish), and Chris came out to greet me and show me the place. Once inside the apartment, there are a set of doors that lead out to the garden which is also enclosed. The apartment was very spacious and tidy.
We selected Heather’s cottage because it was located just a block my son and his family. ), and happy! It’s located on a quiet street, and we had plenty of fresh towels, blankets, coffee — pretty much everything necessary — and more — to make our holiday visit perfect.
This modern “open space concept” area is done exactly right, and just as open space fans intend — with gracious sitting, eating/work areas, that wonderful aquarium, and an astounding assortment of their collection of interesting libations on glass shelves. Your own room has two windows in  a 90 degree corner covering much of the same view, as well as an intimate glimpse into a typical SF backyard garden below (you are one story above the street, and on a steeply climbing hill, so you are looking out over the neighbors below on the hillside. General city noise with the window open for ventilation was modest, and there is a tiny electronic white sound device if you need it.
We absolutely loved  Lori Stewart place. The very huge Loft is artistically and tastefully furnished. The wide roofgarden filled with a hundred of flowerpots is the best location during breakfast and evening hang out .
The location and view was also just as excellent as advertised. I highly recommend Farmhouse Kitchen: wowowowow. If you're looking for a spot to stay, there's a reason this is Airbnb is a plus location and we'll gladly vouch for our experience.
The great thing, these were all within biking / walking distance of Star and Austin’s place. Just book it now! You won’t be disappointed!
Kim and Taj's cottage was the perfect place to stay when we were in Oakland for a wedding. The Temescal and Rockridge areas were really fun to explore, and there were great restaurants right around the corner from their house. Street parking was easy over the weekend and it's only a 5 minute walk from the BART.
There were plenty of blankets, extra towels, and pillows. I didn't have to worry about my son getting cold at night. There was a full fridge, microwave, toaster oven, hot home plate for cooking, plenty of dishes for eating.
The bedroom was among four other bedrooms on the second floor occupied by other air-bnb travelers (which I didn’t realize before) but we never heard any of the others and we felt completely comfortable. Jeffrey was an absolutely wonderful host for our little staycation. The home is situated in a perfect location with 100% walkability to my favorite parts of SF, and has so much personality and charm.
The area is convenient with walking distance to wholefoods and shops and the pier. We felt safe walking around at night. Bennie Dudgeon was responsive and made sure our check-in went smoothly.
by subway (the nearest subway is 10 min walk). Maggie's place exceeded our expectations. It's beautifully decorated and clean, you can see that Maggie and John care about every detail in order to make your stay as more pleasant as possible.
This is by far the *BEST* place we've ever stayed. Not only is the house perfectly located in the charming Proctor District, Susan creates an immaculate, spacious home that could be featured in House Beautiful magazine or HGTV. She is the consummate host--not only is she extremely responsive and respectful of her guests, she provides for your every need: she left us gourmet goodies in the kitchen from local shoppes, fresh washed seasonal fruit, and stocked the fridge with everything we could've ever wanted for breakfast.
The place is as goo as advertised. Sheri Vowell is a great host and went above the beyond. The location here is as good as it gets, literally two blocks from the beach and walking distance to a pier.
! This place was lovely! It's conveniently located to everything and super charming.
She offered us bikes to browse the neighborhood  The place is amazing and would fit two ppl perfectly. Parking is not an issue as Pamela Drew has her own parking space which we've used and also the st had a free parking spaces..  We definitely gonna recommend our friends to choose such a lovely place if they ever visited LA.. Thank you Pamela Drew
The location was a quick lyft ride to hermosa beach and an easy walk to redondo beach. We only noticed because we slept with the balcony doors open. We really enjoyed that.
I had a fantastic experience at Jimmy's place. Streetside parking was available too. The house atmosphere was down-home comfortable with continental breakfast & chocolates in common areas and had touches of 'posh' with the New Yorker & Bon Appetit on hand along with other amenities.
The bathroom was nice too with a great shower head. She added all if these extra touches that made it so homelike and comfortable. Thomas George also provided a sitting area outside which was a wonderful place to drink your morning tea or coffee.
Heather gave us a very lovely welcome and she gave us many informations about things to do in Tacoma. I would come back here anytime if i stay in Tacoma again! Big Recommendation!
This was one of the best, if not THE best Air BnBs we have ever stayed in. The space is much bigger than the pictures make it appear, with a full dining area, ample kitchen (for breakfasts and take-out dinners), and a super comfortable bed! The kitchen was stocked with dainty for us for breakfast (and some candies for treats)—there must have been at least $40 worth of groceries in there for us to use.
Very thoughtful layout and great local information was in the apartment. Loved the small touches like the postcards in the rack. Didn't use them, though....
She is an excellent host, cook and interior designer. Everything in breakfast is organic. Beddings are 100% cotton.
In fact, the day my husband and I were due to arrive I notified the host that my husband was unable to come and that I was bringing another swim ma with me instead. The decor is lovely and all the extras provided were above and beyond any Airbnb I have stayed at. I will definitely be coming back here.
This apartment, although small, was perfect for our purposes. I wish I’d had the energy to take advantage of the beach bikes! We found the hosts so gracious and enlightening .
Such a cozy home! bed and pillow were comfortable. When we were there, the temp outside was like 31 degrees.
Highly recommended. Just perfect. The place was easy to find, with enough places to park.
We were surprised by the amenities offered such as teas, coffee, luxury toiletries, local guides and even a bidet! Beach living in a quiet, inviting setting.
The place was very clean and stylish. There is a house manual that is pretty helpful and the hosts provide their contact info too! They offer an excellent amount of bite for you and your guests.
Jennifer Merry and Roberta Hallenbeck offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! It was quite warm when we were there and the AC in the room was great. Meatball is the cutest (loudest) house greeter ever, we love him!
Room was just as pictured, bathroom was spacious and clean. Only issue was that my bf complained about hearing a loud tv noise that couldn’t let him sleep. But, I slept great no issues didn’t bother me.
This suite has the home away from home feel, with some added luxury. When my wife and I were researching honeymoon locations, no hotel matched up to what we were looking for. This topographic point exceeded our expectations and then some.
Starting with the excellent communication with him pre and post our stay in answering and fulfilling my requests to his attention to all the small details provided in this stay. Tyler’s place was welcoming from the very beginning. Beautiful building to walk up to, stylish suite/home and setup, little welcome notes and interesting explanations scattered throughout our room and public spaces!
The cottage is walking distance to the beach. It has 2 very comfortable queen sized beds, beautiful shower, comfy couch with 2 extra chairs, board games, playing cards, and wine glasses already chilling in the deep-freeze upon your arrival. There is a full kitchen and it is stocked with pots and pans, dishes, silverware, condiments, coffee pot, coffee and tea.
She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. The light was really nice as well. We really enjoyed the kitchenette, which was stocked with plastic silverware, coffee, tea, sugar, and had a coffee maker and electric kettle.
The location is close to First Landing Park and there was a bike shop close by called Switching Gears. The location of this place worked out great for us. It took no time at all to get to the ocean front and seconda to get to the closest beach and restaurants.
This was my second time staying at Min's unit, and I would have booked the entire weekend rather than just one night if there had been availability. I knew exactly what to expect since I had stayed in January, but Min did tell me about the recent changes (a new couch and bed). He even met me at my car and helped me with my luggage as well as my parking situation.
Gloria was fantastic! 10/10! Great communicator w/ quick response time.
LOL. This place has all the little touches that makes an airbnb awesome! We can't wait to go back.
The kitchen is well-equipped, and the thoughtful touches of eggs, English muffins, milk, coffee, etc., etc. Jenny & Mark are wonderful hosts, who were very quick to respond to messages. We'd love to stay there again.
How are we supposed to describe in words the MOST AMAZING BB COUPLE we've ever met?? Leonora and Ernie are the best!! Kind, helpful, caring, great conversations.
You are also just off the 101, so those in a car can easily jump onto the highway and travel to other parts of SF or the Bay Area. Whoever coined the phrase, “location, location, location” must have had Brian Burns’s place in mind. Not only is it sparkling clean, this rental is stylishly appointed with a full sized stove, refrigerator, and oven which we found useful for heating up leftovers and making eggs in the morning.
I discovered it last spring when I came up for my daughter's Lacrosse games. The cottage is beautifully decorated. It is restful, quiet, and so comfortable.
The space was so cute, she is very thoughtful and creative with the decorations and lots of attention to detail to make the space as comfortable as possible for guests. Loved the garden. Fresh duck eggs from the backyard ducks were amazing and so nice and generous of her to share!
I had a great stay here on my trip to LA. Jennifer Merry was very aid with check in. The place itself was fantastic as well.
Chris and Tim were wonderful!! The cottage was very clean, with all the amenities you would need for an enjoyable stay. It is close to Shore Drive, but yet seems very private, thanks to a beautiful garden area.
There are adirondack chairs set out and there's a short set of steps from the yard down to the beach. This is a super quiet location that's about as far as you can get from the Vashon business district. We wanted quiet and privacy, and this suits the bill perfectly.
Very comfortable bed, great shower and close to the beach areas. Neva has such a wonderful space to stay when visiting the area! Close to everything needed!
We met Tyler and his partner on the first night, they were both really kind. The location is very not close to the attractions of SF, but with a lot of cafes around, so still very convenient to live here, and taking Uber to anywhere is also easy to manage.
She gave me an early check-in because her previous guest had an early check out. Katherine's place was really clean and really comfortable. It's a good size for one person or a couple.
You have a separate private entrance, full bathroom, room, living room, and a covered outdoor area. There is a door that separates your place and Erik Dickson’s half of the home. In the living room area, there is a mini fridge (not freezer) and microwave in addition to a coffee machine.
We arrived late driving down from Poulsbo after spending time with family on Easter. It was late and we had no problem getting settled in when we arrived. We were pooped and called it a night.
The location is close enough to walk to the BART quickly. They have cute little touches to everything. The breakfast!
Apparently, Linda & Dan's place is popular with honeymooners and it is easy to see why. It is charming and feels like everything about the space has been done with thought and grace. I loved the cast iron tub in the bathroom, near the stand-alone shower, and the light from the discreetly placed windows.
- Amenities are spot on. Coffee, shampoo, you name it. - Area is great.
We had a fantastic stay in Angela's bungalow..  She is such a antic host going above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. Angela was such an attentive host and her place has all these fantastic surprise ameneties: lotion socks in the bathrobe pocket, eggs, yogurt, muffins, etc., in the ref, guidebooks, bikes, snacks here and there...  Great neighborhood, cozy place—with outdoor spaces to relax. Thank you, Angela.
I totally get it about no tv - there’s enough to do outside that you don’t need indoor entertainment. We just like to have the news on as we wake up and fall asleep. We had a great time and are totally giving 5 stars.
This place is great, very clean and has everything you need. We just left this beautiful Airbnb and already miss it. T was the most responsive and friendly host we’ve had to date!
Pamela Drew and Star were accommodating from the beginning. We were driving from Lehigh Valley, PA., and knew we would get in a lot sooner than the 3 PM check-in. Star allowed us to check in earlier upon our arrival.
Would stay again! The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The rental was in a quiet neighborhood that was just a block away from the Redondo beach.
If you happened to forget something before arriving, the house likely has a clean spare of what you need (toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc). We were not left short for anything. The location: This is a perfect example of a place that is really close to bustling downtown area without being right in the center of the chaos.
Easy access into the cottage and easy to find with her directions! Tiana was a fabulous host and always available throughout my stay. The beach house was very clean, comfortable, stylishly decorated and  a great location right by the beach.
Lovely home a short walk from Redondo Beach (access via Torrance Blvd). Checking in and out was super easy as both the outside door and the bedroom door have code --I received an email with detailed instructions ahead of time. Elizabeth was friendly and communicative through text message and offered us coffee from the Keurig.
The parking was perfect! I would recommend you stay here! I have one tip: the corner store a few blocks away is very expensive.
Thank you so much for sharing your loft with us and it was lovely to meet you! I had the perfect stay. Gregory Simons is the most welcoming and friendly host.
Everything was so nice---easy to locate, good parking, immaculately clean, great snacks and breakfast foods, bed were very comfortable with great bedding. I will definitely contact Susan again if I need a place to stay in Tacoma.
The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door).
Hairdryer, straighteners, mini fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks, amazing bath and hair products, even phone chargers on both sides of the bed. The living area upstairs is beautiful, with an amazing view of SF from the balcony. Deborah Hines and his partner were both very hospitable, even invited us to have a glass of champagne when Deborah Hines’s family came over to visit.
Morning sunrise and evening sunset are an everyday delight whether you're indoors viewing it from the main area which is totally and creatively open with what I believe is 30+ feet height windows sprawling the open area. Gorgeous views! And, just as important to note - the friendliness of Erik Dickson is real!
Shantell Preusser was very welcoming and accommodating during our visit. He allowed us to check in a bit earlier than expected due to our flight coming in a bit earlier and personally walked us through the place and all the aspect of it. He left a ha du guide for us to follow of the local places to visit.
Streetside parking was available too. I enjoyed the themed Beach Room with comfortable bed linens and a position of Mt. Ranier ( in the distance).
The loft is very stylish, very clean, and comfortable with great amenities [e.g., internet, washer/dryer, French press and coffee, snacks, eggs, etc.]. Perfect launching pad for exploring the best Tacoma has to offer.
Kitchen area was great, stocked with all of the appliances, cookware & dishes we needed. We appreciated all of the extra touches -- the coffee bar, snacks, the bottle of wine! A lot of pride and thoughtfulness goes into making this stay what it is!
This is a beautiful topographic point . Sparkling clean, cute, and memorable. The interior decoration brings an incredible atmosphere.
It was exactly how it was described. All the amenities of our own home. Although we didn't cook at all just having that option available was comforting.
If you use the Oakland airport it is only minutes away. Diana's casita is absolutely beautiful! The space was clean and bright due to the natural light that comes through the windows.
The location is great too - near lots of bar and restaurants  The room has so many personal touches and Tyler has thought of every small detail from iPhone chargers, bath robes to ear plugs. The style of the room is super  cool too - it feels like staying in a room at the ace hotel. We only had two days to explore SF so we only used this room as a base but would love to have spent more time here.
Their street is very comfortable/safe, but a few streets from the BART West Oakland to their home may seem unsafe or less well kept. When my friend and I stayed (two women, recent college grads) we had no issues... Just something to keep in mind (just like traveling to any unfamiliar neighborhood).
There was great water pressure, and while we noticed the large spa tub, we didn't have time to use it (besides, we're Californians who worry about water use! ), but I'm sure it would be great! The location is fantastic !
Lucky for us, the sun was out this week so we got a beautiful view of the water, and Edwin Green was kind enough to let us see more of the view from her own balcony. She provided a lot of info on where to eat close by, and where to shop. She was kind enough to provide snacks and drinks that we took advantage and ended up staying in on our last day watching a football game on her big Screen tv.
Me and My Husband stayed for our Anniversary and had a peaceful relaxing time. The Place is Clean and comfortable. It is walking distance to the Beach and Tammy has Bikes and Boggie Boards for your stay.
It's very quiet at night which offers you a great sleep. Heather and JP are great hosts who will help you with all your questions. All in all we had a very comfortable stay.
And the bathtub!!! Super great soaks at night. The bed is like sinking into a pillow...I slept 9 hours each night!
We are hoping to visit again soon and try out another one of their locations! Christine’s place was awesome! My wife and I came here for a long weekend and really enjoyed ourselves.
Nina’s tiny home is making me re-evaluate my life choices. The collection of James Walker coffee and teas were such a nice touch, and even the sparkling assorted sodas in the refrigerator was a nice surprise. There’s an organic market within 5 minutes of walking, and I was able to buy coconut cream pitcher and other item .
It was charmingly decorated, with all amenities of home and more. Even more lovely and spacious than the photos are able to show. We took full advantage of all the neighborhood had to offer, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping and more using reference material provided by the hosts.
Also, because this place is on the outer limit of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood. I found parking in that neighborhood to be quite accessible. On my last morning there I had a lovely coffee at the Precita Park cafe which is very close...the food being served looked tasty.
I’m taking some ideas home with me to spruce up my interior decoration ! Downtown Chicago is about a 45-55 minute Uber ride during the week. Also the host was great and I love that they texted instead of called!
The location was perfect, easy walk to the beach and pier. Dennis Steward was so kind & welcoming, as well as knowing about the area. I will definitely be staying there again next time I visit, hopefully very soon!
Bob & Sharann’s place provides not only a reasonably priced stay, but in addition, a lovely patio, a place to store & heat food, a fireplace (my personal favorite! It is nice to know that you are taken care of while at their place. It truly felt like a home away from home.
Also I have to acknowledge the communication prior arrival was really quick and clear. Maggie's place is in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. We enjoyed our ten minute walk to subway station, and found people watching in metro amusing.
My parents were visiting from out of town for their first trip to the Seattle/Tacoma area and to meet my fiance for the first time. This was also their first stay in an Airbnb, which they were a little hesitant about. But after checking- inch and spending one night at Rayford Kelly place, they were hooked for life!
The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. Joseph Lewis was having some electrical issues in the bathroom, so he put in a lamp. However, in the daytime, sun shines in through the skylight, providing natural light in the bathroom.
The cottage was cozy and peaceful, in a quiet neighborhood right by the beach. It was within walking distance of a bunch of restaurants, as well. The space was serene, the bed was comfy, and if we had wanted to cook, there was a fully-equipped kitchen available.
The location is also perfect, as it is close to Metro bus station and 63 Drive-Rego Subway station. Thanks again, Maggie & John!
Parking is easy and the drive to key areas of LA are about 30 minutes. Beaches are within a  20 minute walk, 10 minute bike ride, or 5 minute drive. Lots of restaurants nearby.
Linda's place is very central in Tacoma, easy to find, 2 blocks from a great little restaurant, quick drive to downtown and the museums. Couldn't ask for anything more.
Funky artwork throughout, which we appreciated. Bed was very comfy, water pressure was excellent in the shower. We really enjoyed the neighborhood—nothing sketchy, and plenty of good places to eat.
Place is very stylish, small and cozy. Clean place and good snacks. I enjoyed my stay.
Both me and my wife love the manner you decorated your unit and its cleanliness. Thank you for making us feel so at home that we have to leave with heavy heart after staying for 5 days. I hope we a chance to visit you and Mark again in SF.
This place is delightful. It’s very stylish and a perfect size for two. It was extremely clean and an excellent place to arrive at after three night camping in Yosemite.
Great experience all round. The Host was amazing. We stayed for over two weeks to play beach sports and the location was perfect.
So spacious. sheet so soft on a mattress that was so comfortable. Amazing cordial reception .
From the apt I walked all the way home from UCal Berkeley and the Botanical Garden, which is probably only for people who love to walk as I do. I also walked easily over to Cesar Chavez Park and the Marina. Otherwise, you can take Uber or Lyft or public transport via 511.org to get where you want to be, or walk a block and a half to the cute shops and restaurants along 4th Avenue.
During the tour she pointed out helpful maps that were framed and also local restaurant menus for us to look at if we wanted to order out. She also had board games for everyone to play and a very nice Keurig machine with K-cups available. The private cozy cottage was more than I expected to be.
The topographical point itself was antic as well. I would definitely stay here again if I came to this area again. Highly recommend!
It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 minute to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!
This listing is a gem, especially considering it's in Forest Hills, which is basically the Beverly Hills of New York. It's about a 15-minute walk from the subway, but it's a lovely and safe walk.
I asked for several recommendations and he had a variety of options for anything I asked. He went above & beyond when I asked for wine country recommendations and gave me a whole layout of the area, and a list to follow for the day. He truly puts so much thought and care into his home.
Very close to the beach. Parking space included right next to entrance, which was nice. Highly recommended.
Walking on the beach in the morning and watching surfers out on the water was a real treat!! We were on the fence about staying this far from business district San Francisco, but we're so glad we did. Transportation into the heart of the city is just a short train ride away, and even if you stick around the area, there is so much to explore.
Miranda Malone has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and restful ! There were bottle of water, juices, and yogurts in the fridge. Extra towels, iron, travel size bathroom essentials in case you forgot yours and even umbrellas!
I would def stay here again if I’m back in the area. Our clean, bright and comfy room was more wonderful than we had hoped for. It was like staying with family or friends.
She had recently purchased a new Casper mattress. Both the bed and her linens were extremely comfortable. A good bed is always a must.
If you love the feel of a modern brand new place, this is the topographic point that you would enjoy. It has 2 bed rooms and 3 1/2 baths with a kitchen that I wish I had in my house. It also has a balcony that shows a view of all of Tacoma.
Great stay! Bob and Sharann’s place is an excellent option for staying in the DuPont area. We were welcomed personally, and the suite included many personal touches that made it a very comfortable place to stay.
John Mullins gave us really detailed history and sightseeing tips so we loved that. The location is great for getting into San Francisco and we found everything easy and accessible. Thank you so much for the stay!
Angela's place is perfect for 1-2. Would highly recommend her place.
At the mention of my slight fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. We were just married and are taking our honeymoon in a few months, so we stopped here for a “mini-moon”. Angela had ready for us a cheese plate, some sparkling wine, and chocolates!
Perks provided are the bikes, and all beach necessities - so no need to pack or buy any! We can totally recommend staying at Tammy's  places. We really enjoyed our stay and we wish we could have stayed longer.
There’s a few restaurant nearby which offers decent brunch & dinner. Thanks sandy n Kristine once again, their Two doggies were rly tame and cute as well!
They both were super quick to reply to any questions or requests that we made,  our whole experience was AWESOME! My family had an amazing beach week at The Carriage House! Convenient location, just steps from the sand!
There is even an outdoor shower and all sorts of beach items for guests to use. Don’t miss booking this gem.
As far as location, Wicker park is cool -  we found two awesome restaurants within walking distance and chose to eat nearby. I hope to stay here again next time I go to Chicago, and I highly recommend it for other Airbnb'ers.
Pamela Drew is an amazing hostess. This is a great location and the room is private and very clean. Bed was super comfy and the amenities top notch!
City of Tacoma has loads of offer. College students give the city a fun and youthful vibe. host are super responsive and work hard to make your stay great.
Shelton Gill checked in with me just to make sure I had everything I needed. Definitely a small gem in Tacoma.
Linda's place is the sort that I  love about AirBnB; clean, a bit eccentric, quiet, & "comfy". What more could you ask for? 6 stars (out of 5)
I can’t say enough good things here! This is my second time at Lori Stewart topographic point . The location can’t be beat.
The suite is completely updated with high-end fixtures, gorgeous natural light, and complete privacy. While there is no access to a kitchen, all of the best food is within blocks and within minutes of the front door. I was also pleasantly surprised at the setup of receiving my own key to the front door (I’ve only rented entire homes previously), where three private suites are all accessible from the main hall, and Jeffrey’s private residence is an entirely separate entrance.
Thanks,  Erica! Would definitely recommend this garden cottage! Great for 1-2 people, the space is private, intimate, and relaxing.
Feels like a cozy home away from home We really loved staying at Justin's place - perfect for our needs. Incredibly-well located near to the University campus, gourmet ghetto with its great choice of eateries, and the Rose Garden and hill above.
 World Health Organization wouldn’t like that?) Thank you Michelle!
It is within easy reach of public transportation into the heart of the city, but it is far enough away from the city to offer a quiet respite from the hubbub of San Francisco. Heathers apartment was exactly as I expected it to be, it is exactly as pictured, clean and aired. The location was ideal for us, we didn’t want to stay downtown we wanted chilled and slower which is exactly what we got.
The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. You can totally get around on public transit (mostly Matthew An) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into business district .
She really looked after me, at a time when I really needed it. I was made to feel completely at home, being offered a bath with some yummy bath salts, and full access to her gorgeous kitchen and everything it had to offer. The room even had a little 'hot shot' machine, that heats up a mug of water for an instant tea!
This is what airbnb is all about. Sure this cottage is small but it's also perfection with every space carefully planned, quaint but functional and packed with gadgets, amenities, utensils, bikes, bose speaker, etc. everything  you could possibly need, sublime hosting...... Great location, friendly/kind host, so many generous, considered extra touches that just make your vacation experience better.
Rayford Kelly's place is on the northern edge of Forest Hills and the walk to the subway is only 7 minutes. The space is clean and stylish! Pamela Drew worked well, the bathroom had extra amenities and Rayford Kelly has designed the space to have everything you might need (q-tips, tissue , postcards, filtered water, extra hangers, etc.
Elizabeth’s place was an easy walk to my venue on the beach. Staying at Elizabeth’s was the perfect choice for me.
Scott is a great host who has gone above and beyond to create a great experience for his guests. From step by step guides to local grocery stores and eateries to towel warmers and LED light Scott has thought of every detail that will provide a wonderful experience for his guests. Having stayed just short of three weeks, I most appreciated the gourmet kitchen as I could cook some meals, the patio to enjoy some fresh air, and the fact that the beach was within walking distance of his home.
On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water. Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.
Scott was so thoughtful in every detail of setting up our stay. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it! Thank you, Scott.
Location can’t be beat, right slap dab in Chicago. The room had a good lock on the door so it really felt secure. Don’t hesitate to book this awesome topographical point !
She made certain that all was okay during my stay. Christina is the most lovely person. She really looked after me, at a time when I really needed it.
There's a great Italian restaurant around the corner from him if you want some grub and then come back and relax in the nicely decorated place. Elizabeth was very accommodating. She rearranged her schedule to be home for our midday arrival.
I love that there is a desk now, since I do have to work a bit while away. Clean, spacious, convenient, quiet - couldn't ask for more. I highly recommend Edward Ramsey's place!
The check-in process was seamless. The mattress was soft and led to one of the best sleeping experiences I have had in a long time. Ernie has lived in the Seattle/Tacoma area his entire life and had so many great tips about where to go and what to see.
And little handwritten notes everywhere. After a day of driving, shlepping, packing/unpacking, cleaning, and generally helping my student move into or out of the dorm, what a joy it is to arrive at Lindsay Brown and Khanh's home. Peaceful, spotless, welcoming, the music is softly playing and the stress is gone.
Tyler’s place was spotless upon arrival and had everything we needed to enjoy eating in and cooking when we wanted to. Lovely and recently renovated home in the Outer Sunset -- just a few blocks away from the beach + one of the best "hot" restaurants in SF (Outerlands). Tyler is easy to communicate with and his place is exceptionally clean, well-decorated and has a new, very comfortable mattress.
Jeremy Johnson! He also helped us carry our luggage and introduced the room with great enthusiasm. House environment is super good, clean and have good taste, it has a small yard ,you can BBQ and warm yourself by the fire, this desirable house is in oakland, the environment of oakland is very comfortable, It's completely opposite for the feeling of the downtown , the first night to check in we saw two deer crossing the road, they are so lovely, if you are coming to San Francisco,please choose geroge's house,it's  must be amazing.
The kitchen also included a full size fridge, paper plates, cutlery, and plastic cups- this was great because we didn’t think to purchase these and ordered in one night. The place was also spotless! I usually do a rub down of any hotel we book and I didn’t need to here.
SOL, Times Square etc. Overall, I would recommend this accommodation.
He offered us an umbrella as well, but we had brought ours. Bennie Dudgeon were also left there for us, but we couldn't utilize them in the end. After a long day at the beach, we were able to wash away our day in the oversized  shower (loved the shower so much!)
It's beautifully decorated and clean, you can see that Maggie and John care about every detail in order to make your stay as more pleasant as possible. If I ever come back to NYC, will choose this place again.
The first thing you’ll notice is that Chris and Tim want you to have the best time possible. They are quick to offer advice on where to go, what to see, and where to eat. The front garden is magical and the cottage is so nicely decorated and appointed.
Amazing beach cottage! bungalow has everything you need, bed is very comfortable and shower is awesome! The hosts have done a great job creating a beautiful guest cottage, we loved our time there and wish we could’ve stayed longer!
You have your own privacy and street parking wasn't terrible either! It is on the 3rd floor so if you have heavy luggage just be ready to carry it up a flight of steps (totally do-able)! The closet was huge and the balcony puts a nice touch on the suite!
If you are staying in this area and don't stay here, you are really missing a special place. Liz is truly a lovely person and wonderful host. The room is HUGE, super clean, and comfy bed.
It was a short few minute walk to the beach and it was so nice to have a dedicated parking topographic point . Book it! You won’t be disappointed.
With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like comforts in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. We just wished we could have stayed longer!
The place is great! The master bedroom is well furnished, relaxing, and comes with granite countertops/ granite/tile master bath. Elizabeth is a friendly host, the whole stay was effortless.
There’s tons of places to eat and grab coffee, just a few blocks from the house. We had so much fun and can’t wait to come back some day. Thanks, Tyler!
Too bad there isn't a 6 stars rating because our stay was just that great! George & Colleen's place was super comfortable, sparkling clean, stylishly decorated and spacious for our family of 3. There is a cute backyard and our preschool son loved roasting marshmallows in the fire pit!
It’s like Edwin Green is saying “ Mi casa es su casa”. I definitely will stay here again!
It is as nice as it seems in the picture . The location is ideal if you are after the awesome beach vibes and laid back athmosphere. It’s easily reachable by car and there is a parking spot in front of the cottage.
We stayed a long weekend with four adults and a baby. The cottage was beautifully decorated and very comfortable for all of us. The location is amazing, near the beach and walking distance to many restaurant .
The book with very personal SFO advise is very useful and the spots recommended were fabulous! The coffee & personal touches through the apartment were a real bonus and we felt homely from the start! Lauren Jensen is lovely and her place allowed us to explore San Fransisco feeling like a local!
It was wonderful and held us over until lunch. We loved our stay here and will continue to tell people about it.
Tiana has a great team that takes care of the space, is nearby if you need assistance, and will provide everything you could ever need. And the shower pressure is fantastic! The living structure they've created for travelers is very special, but the location is really what makes this place a gem.
Joan Litwin and her house are very warm and welcoming. ace quiet vicinity with sixth just two blocks away. Wouldn’t even know it.
This is an absolute gem that we lucked into during our stay in Tacoma! Michelle is an amazing host - quick response times, wonderful insights about the area, and just a warm ,funny, and friendly person. We loved getting to chat with her.
This is a lovely, tranquil, very clean room in a quiet neighborhood of Berkeley. Grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants are also within walking distance. I had to make a short job-related trip to UC Berkeley and this place was perfect for getting some work done in the evening.
The space is really nice. It’s light, very well equipped and has a lovely little seating area looking out at a sweet garden. Laurie met us personally and was lovely.
Everything was perfect about Bob and Sharann's suite. The room was beautifully and comfortably furnished and charmingly decorated with fascinating antiques. We were delighted by all the extras provided, like the fireplace, heated blanket, Keurig machine and Netflix.
The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. Tyler's attention to detail in the room and to his guests really shows he cares about the guests that stay. He has small notes around the room and house explaining how to use everything, which was a great help.
i love her house. Staying at Elizabeth’s place is an A+ experience. She offers warm hospitality, excellent accommodations, a superior location near the beach,  and off-street parking!
We would love to visit again :) I just spent a couple of nights at Sequoiah's place and it was wonderful! The place is really beautiful, especially if you like nature and greenery--it is everywhere!
She also provides us with bicycle so we can took a bike trip along Redondo Beach and Manhattan beach. I can’t wait to visit her following time!
If we didn’t live on the East coast I would stay here more often. Thank you Angela for the beautiful little home away from home. We absolutely loved it there!
Would love to stay here again- highly recommend. I love Angela's place! It is thoughtful, comfortable, clean and cozy, with lots of added amenities.
The middle level of the house is a beautifully designed kitchen and living area. One night, Tyler saved us a spot and moved his car to the street and told us to text him when we arrived so he could give us his spot. We drove from the house to downtown SF and it was about a 25 minute drive with traffic.
We love old houses and it was a great quaint bungalow. We slept extremely well in the very quiet bedroom in unit 2. Note that the bathroom is quite narrow and the unit is up a flight of stairs.
There was even a cruiser bike, which made my commute to my conference fun - and it was perfect for the bike trail along the beach. This is easily one of my favorite AirBnB experience of all time.
She had beach towels, warm robes, and even eggs and yogurt in the fridge for us. We had a fantastic stay in Angela's bungalow..  She is such a fantastic host going above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. Angela has everything you could possibly need for a summer stay in LA.
Maggie and Johns place is AMAAAAAZING! It is clean, well stocked and much better than any villa or private apartment that I’ve stayed in! We will definitely be back again !!
It was BEAUTIFUL and the bed was the MOST comfortable we have ever slept on. Dasha responded quickly anytime for anything we asked. We loved they had coffee in the unit and creamer in the fridge.
You can totally get around on public theodolite (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!
This place is great! The bikes were really my favorite part, and I spent a day cruising up and down the coast on the fantastic bike route. I would highly recommend staying at Paul's cottage!
It is quiet and clean. There are plenty of places to eat. Thank you Barb and Pat.
We had fun and laughed a lot with Michael especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . Sorry for that Michael . Should we come to visit Chicago again sometime , we definitely will stay again in his place.
This is an amazing find in a city crowded with excellent listings. I was able to get some work done in the common space while taking in the skyline. Even had a quick chat with Tyler, who shared some great local recommendation .
Also, because this place is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood. Next time I'll eat there! Highly recommended.
Not only was it lovely to be in a home in a neighborhood, but the room was like a lux hotel suite! Rayford Kelly has gone above and beyond thinking of ways to make our stay comfortable; a comfy bed, a sparkling room, lovely bath amenities, and snacks. It was great and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco who is ambulatory.
I loved the photograph to describe how to find the entrance to the unit. Pam and Marcos Blount are fantastic hosts. We arrived a bit earlier than we expected, and they graciously welcomed us and allowed us to settle in.
Enjoyed our mother/daughter 2-day stay immensely! :)   Felt very safe; loved the central location; and appreciated the bikes to ride along the beach! Super welcoming and helpful host .
It was great and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco who is ambulatory. I say ambulatory because Tyler's place is on a steep street and you will need to climb stairs to his entry- so you have to be able to walk/climb. Also, because this place is on the outer limits of San Fransisco, you will likely want a car though I did see public transportation in the neighborhood.
This studio is small but packs a batch of punches! The location was a true Airbnb in that you are in a neighbourhood, but still close to restaurants and BART (Mission). We especially enjoyed the tea/coffee/breakfast nook with its kettle!
My husband and I had a lovely stay and really appreciated how well stocked the space was. As someone who commutes by foot regularly, I thought it was easy to walk to the Mission District and the BART. The only thing I didn’t love was not having a lock on our bedroom door, though we had no trouble during our stay.
I loved the star jasmine in the entranceway, the fragrance is amazing. He also allowed us to relax in the courtyard which is gorgeous. Paul was so nice, we felt like we knew him for years.
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Chris and Tim's cottage. Just being inside and examining the decor was entertaining in of itself. My husband and I travel a lot and I can say conclusively this was the most adorable place we have ever stayed in.
I could go on longer, but I'll just say that I had the best experience and the best sleep. I came to visit my daughter to celebrate a special occassion. I was looking simply for a topographical point to rest at the end of the day.
That's all I needed to start the petition for 10 stars on Airbnb. As a cold-natured person, the heated blanket was a mega-bonus (besides the toilet - don't forget the toilet). Great stay!
At the mention of my little fear of cold, she eagerly rushed back with an electric blanket just in case I needed it. I’m fairly certain that Angela is part angel. We arrived late on a Sunday night, about an hour later than planned due to a delayed flight.
I stayed two nights, while on business. There is a full set of spices, olive oil, and balsamic-- everything you need to enjoy a light meal. A hair dryer, iron, shampoo/ conditioner/ body wash-- all were provided and were great for business travel.
Third, it was super clean and stylish. My father liked the fact that the bungalow is located in a very safe and quiet residential neighborhood. Heather is very caring for others because she mentioned that she pays out of her own pocket to keep one of the street lights on at all times.
From the Shampoo, conditioner and body wash to the laundry detergent and fabric softer sheets, they have you covered if you forget something or just need to do a load of laundry. The space is immaculate and feels as if you are at a home away from home. From the plush towels to the incredibly comfy beds, you will immediately feel welcome.
The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were tons of small extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of game for us to play after a long day on our feet. Everywhere we needed to go was a quick lyft ride away which made getting around easy and convenient. Thank you for the lovely stay!
We also love the compost toilet.....very easy to use, hygienic, no odor and very ecological. We’ll definitely return!
All in all, a antic AirBnB experience! Erik Dickson’s home is just two blocks off the beach and an easy walk to the Redondo Pier area. A wonderful location.
We had a wonderful stay at Paul's place. It was a 5min walk to the beach and very safe neighborhood. Lots of food places available and Paul had a binder full of great local tips as well.
Thank you Jeni and Michelle, we'll certainly have you at the top of our list when we're back in Tacoma again Proctor Cottage was truly our home away from home. The hosts paid attention to every singe detail.
The walk in closet was amazing . We stayed 2 weekends in a row. We would definitely stay there if we were in the area again.
Angela’s place was really special—beautiful decor, comfortable, very clean. She thought of everything, even having coffee and adult beverages available, bikes, and fresh fruit. There was even a luxurious new mattress which was so comfortable.
The view toward the garden in the back of the house is  amazing and the whole atmosphere is very peaceful. Rayford Kelly place is in a quiet location and beautiful apartment. The apartment is comfortable and quaint.
Diana is very responsive, and she was even away when we stayed, but responded to all requests right away. We were greeted by Colin right after we parked. The street is lovely and quiet, it feels like a safe neighborhood with a lot of people who have probably lived in their homes a while.
Thought out. Friendly. Comfortable bed and plenty of pillows!
Keeping this in mind we were respectful of the host and they of use - I did not hear or see anyone the whole time, making for a private stay. My wife and I brought our own bikes, even though there were beach cruisers provided and it is very easy to bike from the house to the boardwalk bike path and back. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to getaway for a long weekend and will keep it in mind for our future trips!
I highly recommend her place! Highly recommend! Angela was very thoughtful in the special touches she adds to her space like having beer and cocoa waiting for us when we arrived and making bikes available for us.
He also has a sweet dog that is extremely well behaved and let me love on him several times. Next time I’ll use UBER to avoid $16 per day hotel parking or walk there if it’s daylight. The home is in an area that is urban/downtown and may not be for everyone.
The room is gorgeous, spotless, and the bed is so comfortable. To top it off - breakfast! The homemade meal with fresh squeezed orange juice and tasty coffee was the best way to start a morning.
It was our first time in Virginia Beach, and it has won over our hearts... and our stay at Star and Cher Alexander’s topographic point played a huge role in that experience. Their place was super cozy and had such amazing amenities. Our favorite thing to do was to take the bikes out to roam about the city, stopping by cute local stores and listening to late night music jams.
If you want to go to the beach you have to walk about ten minutes. Thanks again Elizabeth!
Staying here was like being at home. I felt like I was at home. It’s like Teresa Knight is saying “ Mi casa es su casa”.
The cottage is also super low-cost , we paid half the cost of what a hotel was charging us in the area and got so much more. Heather also provided us with a well organized folder with menus to nearby restaurants. Overall my Mother and I give the Cozzy Cottage 5 stars all around.
But they kindly provide earplugs so if you bring an eye mask you’ll be all set! Thank you!
We only had two days to explore SF so we only used this room as a base but would love to have spent more time here. Tyler has thought of every detail to make your stay a memorable and enjoyable experience. The house was impeccably clean, the room was quiet and private, the check in was seamless and convenient.
The cabin has ample space for my family of three. It has a batch of plaything and books to keep my little one entertained. The kitchen is well stocked.
It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. I will be back and hope to talk with him again~share stories and learn about new things and places I hadn't known about before! Thank you a million times over Alejandrina Anderson!!
Paul’s meticulously arranged private guest house is, simply put, impeccable. Not only does the room is equipped everything one can desire for both short and long term stay, the location is also convenient with easy beach access and LAX in proximity.
! Deanna's place is really special. We had 2 lovely days and nights here and enjoyed every moment.
I really hope to stay here again. This has to be my favorite Airbnb experience to date. The loft is very spacious, stylish, comfortable, surprisingly private despite the location, and secure.
The house itself is  about 2 blocks off the beach. Love. This.
Third, it was super clean and stylish. My father liked the fact that the cottage is located in a very safe and quiet residential neighborhood. Heather is very caring for others because she mentioned that she pays out of her own pocket to keep one of the street lights on at all times.
The view of Commencement Bay from the studio, the comfortable bed , furnishings and HD television, the thoughtful bite all create a lovely experience in this clean, efficient studio. Parking is readily available on the street in front of the well-lit and inviting entrance. Christiana is an excellent host.
Everything was very clean and functional. I highly recommend staying here.
This was my first experience with an Air bnb and it far exceeded my expectations. We will definitely be back next year ...    Pamela Drew and Danelle H.
Target is a much clean , safer option. Thanks again!
This place was amazing! Very cozy and quaint. The details of the decor was awesome.
Walkable shopping/dining/drinks options. Susan's communication is fast and friendly if you were to have a problem. Which we didn’t.
Great place to stay. The unit was so quiet at night that I didn't have any issues falling asleep (and I'm a light sleeper too!). Host was very nice and enlightening .
I would highly recommend Alejandrina Anderson place to anyone looking to stay in SF! My husband and I stayed here for two nights before I dropped him at SFO  The space is clean and roomy (for a studio), with high ceilings, a walk in closet, large bathroom, and comfortable seating area. The weather was great when we visited, so we loved the balcony.
This is a gorgeous space, decorated with creative flair. We appreciated the breakfast provisions in the fridge. Most of all, we loved chatting to Jenny and Mark on the morning we left.
Angela's place is perfect for 1-2. It was a great location with an easy drive from the airport, walk to the beach and restaurants. She had many extra touch that made us feel at home.
Very clean. Definitely would recommend this place.
The price was great too! Very spacious and nicer than the average hotel in this price range.
Their place is truly a respite. I certainly was not surprised to just learn that John Mullins home was featured in Reader's Digest as a top airbnb in the state Virginia. An absolute gem of a place!
It's exactly as described - a standalone cottage/room in the garden, separated from the main house. It was cosy and clean. The bed was comfortable; there is a couch, a coffee table, and a small library of books.
In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy).
Loved our stay. We literally wouldn't change a thing: comfy bed, Roku TV with Joseph Lewis, lots of closet space, clean, plenty of sunlight, good WiFi, private entrance, parking and the beach practically in your backyard! Shantell Preusser was quick to respond and very friendly.
Heather is a great host and has tons of information / guide books plus personal tips to suggest if you need help. The area is fantastic , residential , quiet but still lots of great topographic point to eat at half the price of downtown. The beach is an amazing 4 mile stretch which is great for walking & just taking in the gorgeous views / sea air.
We were met with incredible hospitality, a beautiful space, a super friendly porch, and a fantastic location. We LOVED our stay at Paul’s guest house!! The house was in an ideal location.
Electronics kits? Old powered Microscopes?) WHAT FUN!
It is convenient to a BART stop - either a walk or short Uber ride - that makes it easy to travel to downtown or the Airport. We loved staying here in Berkeley. The space is really nice.
She is so lovely and friendly everyday. You must go steep stairs but that's ok. Sassy the little dog of her is sooo cute. There is all you need in kitchen, bathroom, living room bedroom.
Heather is lovely and her place allowed us to explore San Fransisco feeling like a local! Thank you Heather!
Thanks for a great stay :) Great value for the price range! I was very pleased.
I will absolutely be returning to San Francisco, and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else! Heather’s topographical point is just as pictured and is in a beautiful, scenic location right across from Ocean Beach. She had a nice bottle of wine & some delectable chocolates waiting for us on arrival.
Perfect place to stay in SF. Beautiful room, sparkling clean and large shower with immediate hot water, comfortable bed with high-quality linens, public transportation easily available, close to several coffee shops and yummy bakeries, easy walk to Golden Gate Park, close to Safeway, and immediate response from Chris to any request. The view from the multiple back windows was of a lush garden, which made a relaxing spot to read or have a glass of wine.
I highly recommend staying here for a trip to California. We would love to stay here again for our following trip to California!
We loved our stay at Jeanna's, the place really felt like a home to us. She had a chalkboard sign on her front door saying "Welcome Jason!" which my wife loved, it made us feel like we were wanted as guests.
The home was so bright and cheerful, and the kitchen had all the amenities and then some for those that are super inspired to cook for themselves. She has taken great care to offer many special touches to make the experience feel like you have arrived to a well cared for home, to offer all of your basic needs and then some. The only thing that I would have enjoyed and  made it perfect would have been a bathtub!
We hope to be back again. Had a lovely two night stay. Robert Turpen greeted us and showed us around and was very welcoming and funny.
Finally regarding the location you cant beat it. Overall great value for the cost and beautiful topographic point . If I’m ever in LA again and not staying with my in-laws I would definitely stay at his place again.
Check in was easy. Surrounding area is beautiful. Walk to metro is about 15 minute .
I was looking simply for a place to rest at the end of the day. What I found at the casita was a beautiful spot with a million dollar view. Every detail was thoughtfully presented...from an oh-so-comfortable bed to great art; from starting me off with fresh fruit and english muffins to a deck overlooking the bay area; from lovely towels to a very pretty living room and kitchen.
 fantastic place to stay! After spending the 4 nights before in an apartment, a tent and a hotel... it was great to spread out here and relax! Great location with easy distance to tons of restaurants & activities.
There is a set named "Charming Hostess" that is related to the music I heard -- they were not present that night, but their title was instead ably filled by Jodi Stallings. Jodi Stallings is the hostess with the mostest! She is very attentive to details, and offers a gourmet breakfast every morning.
It was ideal for me. The yard is beautiful and a great place to hang out. The bathroom is cozy and stylishly decorated with a wonderful shower and sink.
It was perfect for me traveling alone but know that you basically have just the bed and a tiny bathroom. Another thing that could be improved would be the WiFi... it was painfully bad. Since I was in LA for a job interview it was irritating that I couldn't even get (Hidden by Airbnb) to load at times.
Chuck is available and close by, yet you feel like you have the house alone. I loved relaxing in the hot bathtub , robes provided, the chefs kitchen and cool lighting. I think our stay will be a sweet memory, not just lodging on a trip.
Angela's little studio was just what I needed for 2 days in SF. The room had all the amenities you would need for a comfortable stay. Check in was simple and you can do so any time since it's a self-check-in process.
The location is ideal. The studio is close to a brewery and to some of my favorites places to eat in the Bay:  Bake-sale Robert Turpen's and Lori Stewart. I would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend this place enough.
The bed was very comfortable. Wish we could have stayed more than one night! Great hosts, sweet dogs, beautiful neighborhood, we look forward to visiting again and will recommend to our friends and family whenever they’re in the area.
We had the most wonderful stay at Ron & Laurie’s guesthouse. They have really thought of everything their guests might need. They had complied an incredibly extensive guest book for local tips and offered lots of delicious restaurant suggestions.
It is attached to her home but feels very secluded with separate, outside access around the side. Keeping this in mind we were respectful of the host and they of use - I did not hear or see anyone the whole time, making for a private stay. The place is clean and well equipped - including coffee and creamer, which is very nice!
We had a great stay in this charming bungalow and loved sitting out on the patio with a glass of wine. Unfortunately there was construction next door, luckily I had earplugs and I’m not a light sleeper. Thanks for your hospitality!!
Onsite parking so you don't have to deal with hunting for on-street parking. Luxury hotel accommodations without the hotel price and hassle.
Brian and Sarah's place was one of the nicest so far. They even stocked breakfast staples (Including Coffee) so we did not have to drive or walk anywhere until we were ready. Their place was spotless and so very comfortable.
Nathan is an incredibly gracious host. Did I mention, Nathan's topographic point is bad buttocks ? Haha, seriously.
Teresa Knight and Sharann are great hosts. Their 5 star suite deserves that title. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels, and it is right up there with them.
My wife and I recently spent two nights at Michael Krieg's place in Berkeley, and enjoyed it a great deal. While the home is a bit hidden from the street, when we walked through the gate we were immediately taken with the sweet fragrances of the beautiful flowers and plants in the front yard. Although I wasn't sure from the home description, there are actually two small spaces to sit outside and enjoy the weather--on the front porch and on a bench in the front yard.
! Lenora and Ernie were warm and hospitable hosts. They had clear instructions for check in and Lenora went through how to open/lock the door, the common areas that could be used, and the breakfast snacks that were available for Airbnb guests.
Waking up in the morning or ending my day with a run/walk around the lake (just steps away) was the best. Central location makes anything you need an Uber ride/Bart/walk away. Mahalo Amy & Dennis for the beautiful stay.
The shower was amazing and big. I believe there is another roommate but she was very reserved. The location is amazing!
Place!!! Already trying to figure out my next business trip so I can stay here again.
Everything was simply perfect. Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing. Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process.
We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds. floss? not to worry!
The comforts are of a great quality and we had everything we needed. Raquel Eastham and Ralph are lovely people and made us all feel welcome. I would not hesitate to recommend this listing.
The location is conveniently close to the blue line and a short Uber ride to some of the best parts of the city. We only stayed for one night but would have been happy to stay for longer!
I knew it was going to be a great home from the sterling reviews, but I was still surprised to find this stylish space that is equipped with every little essentials left there by a very thoughtful host. Paul greeted us with a warm welcome and he made sure we had absolutely everything we needed. The space is furnished and decorated beautifully.
Highly recommended !! We could use a pack and play for our baby and we could have even used bikes. I recommend this topographic point for sure!
It is located very close to adorable shop and restaurant . I loved the star jasmine in the entranceway, the fragrance is amazing. The house was so clean.
I had a wonderful time at Christina's place. The description of the listing is very accurate, it really did feel like a retreat. I stayed 3 nights and would have loved to stay longer.
Stephane’s place is an adorable, very well decorated & clean basement suite in a very nice part of Tacoma, equip with all you need including A/C! The parking was perfect! Jeremy Johnson answered all our questions quickly & was a fantastic host!
We fell in love with this bright, breezy cottage. The extra amenities (beach wagon, boogie boards, sand toys, beach chairs, etc.) helped our beach excursions go off without a hitch.
Jeremy Johnson & John are so wonderful and accommodating! Jeremy Johnson was ever so accommodating! We had a late flight out and wanted to explore Queens & Flushing before heading to JKF, but had no where to store our baggage .
I booked Neva's space while in Redondo taking a local class. It was great! Walking distance to the workshop, a great coffee shop, the beach, etc.
This room has a common wall with the bathroom and a road with moderate traffic outside the bedroom window. The room is equipped with a nice sound machine and earplugs if you’re a light sleeper. While in town I also went to the Olympus woman ’s spa located 15 minutes away and Southern Kitchen which is down the street.
Michael's loft is simply beautiful, clean and exactly as pictured. It is central and easy to walk to from the train. We found it easy to go around without needing to use the subway.
Barb and Pat are people we all wish to cross paths with. They are so kind and interactive. It was a pleasure to witness how much love is in their home.
Space is light, modern, and good sized. We are out while here, but the kitchen was fully furnished and would be easily used for cooking. Location is seriously second to none.
We would love to visit again :) I just spent a couple of nights at Sequoiah's place and it was fantastic ! The place is really beautiful, especially if you like nature and greenery--it is everywhere!
We had such an amazing time riding the bikes she had available for us on the beach! It is the perfect getaway location!
BART is also only 10 minutes away , so you can't beat this topographic point if you want to be secluded, but be close to everything as well! We would definitely book again :)
This was a great airbnb. - Steve
The overall Airbnb is very spacious and very clean and has a cute flower garden out back! Janet Luckman is great at communication and gets back with you within the hour. If me and my fiancé are ever back in the area again  we will  book here again!
This place is a gem. When I first got there, Robert Turpen greeted and acquainted me with the place. I've never been in a bantam home but my guess is this is what it would be like.
The proximity to the beach was amazing and we enjoyed the beach bikes! Tiana could not have been better! She was so helpful and accommodating.
I have stayed at many Airbnb...this one tops my list. Some extra thoughts on the place.... I love Alexa (I'm new to her)  The bed was very comfy.
It is a small very clean studio that somehow manages to have everything you may need. Loved sitting outside and getting to meet Jesse. The location was close enough to everything.
We got in around check in time, they had everything we needed to enjoy our time at the house, bite , water, and a fridge. Wish we could have stayed longer.
It is the perfect place for anyone looking to stay a few nights in San Francisco. Angela's topographic point was beautiful and sparkling clean. We were able to check in early so we could hit the ground running as soon as we got into SF.
The description of the apartment is very accurate and in the folder he has prepared, you can find any information you need about the apartment but also the neighborhood and useful tips for San Francisco. Parking for the night is also relatively easy to find in the adjacent streets. We are happy to recommend Arthur Paddick’s apartment.
We had a great time. The location was perfect for a beach view, but we we also used it as a home base when visiting other parts of LA. Paul was very accommodating and helpful.
The patio garden is very pretty and Betty Maust was so adorable and calm. Teresa Knight is very responsive, and she was even away when we stayed, but responded to all requests right away. We’ll stay here again when we visit SF!
The check-in process was super easy. The bed was very comfortable for 2 people, and my husband especially enjoyed the mini fridge stocked with refreshments :) The shared backyard space was also really well styled and we enjoyed sitting on the deck drinking coffee in the mornings. We had lots of privacy and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful.
It is pretty close to the airport, there is a great breakfast diner close by, the room was much larger than I expected, I loved the King size bed, it was very clean and check in was very convenient and easy. This was a super easy and nice place to stay for our evenning before leaving from LAX the next day. Elizabeth responded quickly and the king bedroom/bathroom were comfortable and just as described.
The bungalow was super cute, tiny but well furnished. Only two people stayed but could easily accommodate four . Location was perfect, super close to beach and restaurants .
It was a bit of a tight space for 4 adults but definitely doable! We had an amazing stay at Tiana’s place. The cottage was very clean, cute and best of all close to the beach.
Me and My Husband stayed for our Anniversary and had a peaceful relaxing time. The Place is Clean and comfortable. It is walking distance to the Beach and Tammy has Bikes and Lori Stewart for your stay.
The space is clean, bright, and comfortable, with wonderful big windows that look out on the water. and and plenty of complimentary teas, coffee, and snacks -- PLUS the most amazing, well-stocked snack bar available for cash/ (Hidden by Airbnb) . What a total treat to be able to stay in instead of going out in search of something to nibble on.
With lots of extras, ie bathrobes, coffee pods, snacks and drinks,  bicycles, beach chairs, choice of a/c or drinking fan, there was even a box of hotel~like amenities in the bathroom filled with lotions, shower caps, etc. Paul's place is LA's hidden gem. If you are looking for a postcard perfect beach, a great host, a quiet neighborhood, somewhere that is close to everything LA has to offer but is outside of the bustling concrete jungle - this is it.
Definitely recommend if you need a place to stay in metro Seattle. Luke’s place is simply the best value for an entire space listing all around the Puget Sound. The pictures just don’t depict the quality and value you’ll receive.
The bed is so comfortable I didn’t want to leave, coffee and breakfast options  in the little  kitchen were very welcome, and the lovely neighborhood setting filled with trees was really nice. It was easy and enjoyable to spend the weekend in Tacoma in this lovely place.
